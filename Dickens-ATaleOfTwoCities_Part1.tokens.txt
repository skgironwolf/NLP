the
first
recalled
to
life
i
the
period
it
was
the
best
of
times
it
was
the
worst
of
times
it
was
the
age
of
wisdom
it
was
the
age
of
foolishness
it
was
the
epoch
of
belief
it
was
the
epoch
of
incredulity
it
was
the
season
of
light
it
was
the
season
of
darkness
it
was
the
spring
of
hope
it
was
the
winter
of
despair
we
had
everything
before
us
we
had
nothing
before
us
we
were
all
going
direct
to
heaven
we
were
all
going
direct
the
other
way
in
short
the
period
was
so
far
like
the
present
period
that
some
of
its
noisiest
authorities
insisted
on
its
being
received
for
good
or
for
evil
in
the
superlative
degree
of
comparison
only
there
were
a
king
with
a
large
jaw
and
a
queen
with
a
plain
face
on
the
throne
of
england
there
were
a
king
with
a
large
jaw
and
a
queen
with
a
fair
face
on
the
throne
of
france
in
both
countries
it
was
clearer
than
crystal
to
the
lords
of
the
state
preserves
of
loaves
and
fishes
that
things
in
general
were
settled
for
ever
it
was
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
five
spiritual
revelations
were
conceded
to
england
at
that
favoured
period
as
at
this
mrs
southcott
had
recently
attained
her
five
and
twentieth
blessed
birthday
of
whom
a
prophetic
private
in
the
life
guards
had
heralded
the
sublime
appearance
by
announcing
that
arrangements
were
made
for
the
swallowing
up
of
london
and
westminster
even
the
cock
lane
ghost
had
been
laid
only
a
round
dozen
of
years
after
rapping
out
its
messages
as
the
spirits
of
this
very
year
last
past
supernaturally
deficient
in
originality
rapped
out
theirs
mere
messages
in
the
earthly
order
of
events
had
lately
come
to
the
english
crown
and
people
from
a
congress
of
british
subjects
in
america
which
strange
to
relate
have
proved
more
important
to
the
human
race
than
any
communications
yet
received
through
any
of
the
chickens
of
the
cock
lane
brood
france
less
favoured
on
the
whole
as
to
matters
spiritual
than
her
sister
of
the
shield
and
trident
rolled
with
exceeding
smoothness
down
hill
making
paper
money
and
spending
it
under
the
guidance
of
her
christian
pastors
she
entertained
herself
besides
with
such
humane
achievements
as
sentencing
a
youth
to
have
his
hands
cut
off
his
tongue
torn
out
with
pincers
and
his
body
burned
alive
because
he
had
not
kneeled
down
in
the
rain
to
do
honour
to
a
dirty
procession
of
monks
which
passed
within
his
view
at
a
distance
of
some
fifty
or
sixty
yards
it
is
likely
enough
that
rooted
in
the
woods
of
france
and
norway
there
were
growing
trees
when
that
sufferer
was
put
to
death
already
marked
by
the
woodman
fate
to
come
down
and
be
sawn
into
boards
to
make
a
certain
movable
framework
with
a
sack
and
a
knife
in
it
terrible
in
history
it
is
likely
enough
that
in
the
rough
outhouses
of
some
tillers
of
the
heavy
lands
adjacent
to
paris
there
were
sheltered
from
the
weather
that
very
day
rude
carts
bespattered
with
rustic
mire
snuffed
about
by
pigs
and
roosted
in
by
poultry
which
the
farmer
death
had
already
set
apart
to
be
his
tumbrils
of
the
revolution
but
that
woodman
and
that
farmer
though
they
work
unceasingly
work
silently
and
no
one
heard
them
as
they
went
about
with
muffled
tread
the
rather
forasmuch
as
to
entertain
any
suspicion
that
they
were
awake
was
to
be
atheistical
and
traitorous
in
england
there
was
scarcely
an
amount
of
order
and
protection
to
justify
much
national
boasting
daring
burglaries
by
armed
men
and
highway
robberies
took
place
in
the
capital
itself
every
night
families
were
publicly
cautioned
not
to
go
out
of
town
without
removing
their
furniture
to
upholsterers
warehouses
for
security
the
highwayman
in
the
dark
was
a
city
tradesman
in
the
light
and
being
recognised
and
challenged
by
his
fellow
tradesman
whom
he
stopped
in
his
character
of
the
captain
gallantly
shot
him
through
the
head
and
rode
away
the
mail
was
waylaid
by
seven
robbers
and
the
guard
shot
three
dead
and
then
got
shot
dead
himself
by
the
other
four
in
consequence
of
the
failure
of
his
ammunition
after
which
the
mail
was
robbed
in
peace
that
magnificent
potentate
the
lord
mayor
of
london
was
made
to
stand
and
deliver
on
turnham
green
by
one
highwayman
who
despoiled
the
illustrious
creature
in
sight
of
all
his
retinue
prisoners
in
london
gaols
fought
battles
with
their
turnkeys
and
the
majesty
of
the
law
fired
blunderbusses
in
among
them
loaded
with
rounds
of
shot
and
ball
thieves
snipped
off
diamond
crosses
from
the
necks
of
noble
lords
at
court
drawing
rooms
musketeers
went
into
st
giles
s
to
search
for
contraband
goods
and
the
mob
fired
on
the
musketeers
and
the
musketeers
fired
on
the
mob
and
nobody
thought
any
of
these
occurrences
much
out
of
the
common
way
in
the
midst
of
them
the
hangman
ever
busy
and
ever
worse
than
useless
was
in
constant
requisition
now
stringing
up
long
rows
of
miscellaneous
criminals
now
hanging
a
housebreaker
on
saturday
who
had
been
taken
on
tuesday
now
burning
people
in
the
hand
at
newgate
by
the
dozen
and
now
burning
pamphlets
at
the
door
of
westminster
hall
to
day
taking
the
life
of
an
atrocious
murderer
and
to
morrow
of
a
wretched
pilferer
who
had
robbed
a
farmer
s
boy
of
sixpence
all
these
things
and
a
thousand
like
them
came
to
pass
in
and
close
upon
the
dear
old
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
five
environed
by
them
while
the
woodman
and
the
farmer
worked
unheeded
those
two
of
the
large
jaws
and
those
other
two
of
the
plain
and
the
fair
faces
trod
with
stir
enough
and
carried
their
divine
rights
with
a
high
hand
thus
did
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
five
conduct
their
greatnesses
and
myriads
of
small
creatures
the
creatures
of
this
chronicle
among
the
rest
along
the
roads
that
lay
before
them
ii
the
mail
it
was
the
dover
road
that
lay
on
a
friday
night
late
in
november
before
the
first
of
the
persons
with
whom
this
history
has
business
the
dover
road
lay
as
to
him
beyond
the
dover
mail
as
it
lumbered
up
shooter
s
hill
he
walked
up
hill
in
the
mire
by
the
side
of
the
mail
as
the
rest
of
the
passengers
did
not
because
they
had
the
least
relish
for
walking
exercise
under
the
circumstances
but
because
the
hill
and
the
harness
and
the
mud
and
the
mail
were
all
so
heavy
that
the
horses
had
three
times
already
come
to
a
stop
besides
once
drawing
the
coach
across
the
road
with
the
mutinous
intent
of
taking
it
back
to
blackheath
reins
and
whip
and
coachman
and
guard
however
in
combination
had
read
that
article
of
war
which
forbade
a
purpose
otherwise
strongly
in
favour
of
the
argument
that
some
brute
animals
are
endued
with
reason
and
the
team
had
capitulated
and
returned
to
their
duty
with
drooping
heads
and
tremulous
tails
they
mashed
their
way
through
the
thick
mud
floundering
and
stumbling
between
whiles
as
if
they
were
falling
to
pieces
at
the
larger
joints
as
often
as
the
driver
rested
them
and
brought
them
to
a
stand
with
a
wary
wo
ho
so
ho
then
the
near
leader
violently
shook
his
head
and
everything
upon
it
like
an
unusually
emphatic
horse
denying
that
the
coach
could
be
got
up
the
hill
whenever
the
leader
made
this
rattle
the
passenger
started
as
a
nervous
passenger
might
and
was
disturbed
in
mind
there
was
a
steaming
mist
in
all
the
hollows
and
it
had
roamed
in
its
forlornness
up
the
hill
like
an
evil
spirit
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
a
clammy
and
intensely
cold
mist
it
made
its
slow
way
through
the
air
in
ripples
that
visibly
followed
and
overspread
one
another
as
the
waves
of
an
unwholesome
sea
might
do
it
was
dense
enough
to
shut
out
everything
from
the
light
of
the
coach
lamps
but
these
its
own
workings
and
a
few
yards
of
road
and
the
reek
of
the
labouring
horses
steamed
into
it
as
if
they
had
made
it
all
two
other
passengers
besides
the
one
were
plodding
up
the
hill
by
the
side
of
the
mail
all
three
were
wrapped
to
the
cheekbones
and
over
the
ears
and
wore
jack
boots
not
one
of
the
three
could
have
said
from
anything
he
saw
what
either
of
the
other
two
was
like
and
each
was
hidden
under
almost
as
many
wrappers
from
the
eyes
of
the
mind
as
from
the
eyes
of
the
body
of
his
two
companions
in
those
days
travellers
were
very
shy
of
being
confidential
on
a
short
notice
for
anybody
on
the
road
might
be
a
robber
or
in
league
with
robbers
as
to
the
latter
when
every
posting
house
and
ale
house
could
produce
somebody
in
the
captain
s
pay
ranging
from
the
landlord
to
the
lowest
stable
non
descript
it
was
the
likeliest
thing
upon
the
cards
so
the
guard
of
the
dover
mail
thought
to
himself
that
friday
night
in
november
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
five
lumbering
up
shooter
s
hill
as
he
stood
on
his
own
particular
perch
behind
the
mail
beating
his
feet
and
keeping
an
eye
and
a
hand
on
the
arm
chest
before
him
where
a
loaded
blunderbuss
lay
at
the
top
of
six
or
eight
loaded
horse
pistols
deposited
on
a
substratum
of
cutlass
the
dover
mail
was
in
its
usual
genial
position
that
the
guard
suspected
the
passengers
the
passengers
suspected
one
another
and
the
guard
they
all
suspected
everybody
else
and
the
coachman
was
sure
of
nothing
but
the
horses
as
to
which
cattle
he
could
with
a
clear
conscience
have
taken
his
oath
on
the
two
testaments
that
they
were
not
fit
for
the
journey
wo
ho
said
the
coachman
so
then
one
more
pull
and
you
re
at
the
top
and
be
damned
to
you
for
i
have
had
trouble
enough
to
get
you
to
it
joe
halloa
the
guard
replied
what
o
clock
do
you
make
it
joe
ten
minutes
good
past
eleven
my
blood
ejaculated
the
vexed
coachman
and
not
atop
of
shooter
s
yet
tst
yah
get
on
with
you
the
emphatic
horse
cut
short
by
the
whip
in
a
most
decided
negative
made
a
decided
scramble
for
it
and
the
three
other
horses
followed
suit
once
more
the
dover
mail
struggled
on
with
the
jack
boots
of
its
passengers
squashing
along
by
its
side
they
had
stopped
when
the
coach
stopped
and
they
kept
close
company
with
it
if
any
one
of
the
three
had
had
the
hardihood
to
propose
to
another
to
walk
on
a
little
ahead
into
the
mist
and
darkness
he
would
have
put
himself
in
a
fair
way
of
getting
shot
instantly
as
a
highwayman
the
last
burst
carried
the
mail
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
the
horses
stopped
to
breathe
again
and
the
guard
got
down
to
skid
the
wheel
for
the
descent
and
open
the
coach
door
to
let
the
passengers
in
tst
joe
cried
the
coachman
in
a
warning
voice
looking
down
from
his
box
what
do
you
say
tom
they
both
listened
i
say
a
horse
at
a
canter
coming
up
joe
i
say
a
horse
at
a
gallop
tom
returned
the
guard
leaving
his
hold
of
the
door
and
mounting
nimbly
to
his
place
gentlemen
in
the
king
s
name
all
of
you
with
this
hurried
adjuration
he
cocked
his
blunderbuss
and
stood
on
the
offensive
the
passenger
booked
by
this
history
was
on
the
coach
step
getting
in
the
two
other
passengers
were
close
behind
him
and
about
to
follow
he
remained
on
the
step
half
in
the
coach
and
half
out
of
they
remained
in
the
road
below
him
they
all
looked
from
the
coachman
to
the
guard
and
from
the
guard
to
the
coachman
and
listened
the
coachman
looked
back
and
the
guard
looked
back
and
even
the
emphatic
leader
pricked
up
his
ears
and
looked
back
without
contradicting
the
stillness
consequent
on
the
cessation
of
the
rumbling
and
labouring
of
the
coach
added
to
the
stillness
of
the
night
made
it
very
quiet
indeed
the
panting
of
the
horses
communicated
a
tremulous
motion
to
the
coach
as
if
it
were
in
a
state
of
agitation
the
hearts
of
the
passengers
beat
loud
enough
perhaps
to
be
heard
but
at
any
rate
the
quiet
pause
was
audibly
expressive
of
people
out
of
breath
and
holding
the
breath
and
having
the
pulses
quickened
by
expectation
the
sound
of
a
horse
at
a
gallop
came
fast
and
furiously
up
the
hill
so
ho
the
guard
sang
out
as
loud
as
he
could
roar
yo
there
stand
i
shall
fire
the
pace
was
suddenly
checked
and
with
much
splashing
and
floundering
a
man
s
voice
called
from
the
mist
is
that
the
dover
mail
never
you
mind
what
it
is
the
guard
retorted
what
are
you
is
that
the
dover
mail
why
do
you
want
to
know
i
want
a
passenger
if
it
is
what
passenger
mr
jarvis
lorry
our
booked
passenger
showed
in
a
moment
that
it
was
his
name
the
guard
the
coachman
and
the
two
other
passengers
eyed
him
distrustfully
keep
where
you
are
the
guard
called
to
the
voice
in
the
mist
because
if
i
should
make
a
mistake
it
could
never
be
set
right
in
your
lifetime
gentleman
of
the
name
of
lorry
answer
straight
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
passenger
then
with
mildly
quavering
speech
who
wants
me
is
it
jerry
i
don
t
like
jerry
s
voice
if
it
is
jerry
growled
the

said
mr
lorry
getting
down
into
the
road
assisted
from
behind
more
swiftly
than
politely
by
the
other
two
passengers
who
immediately
scrambled
into
the
coach
shut
the
door
and
pulled
up
the
window

said
the
guard
in
gruff
soliloquy
hallo

hallo

jerry
more
hoarsely
than
before

i
m
a
devil
at
a
quick
mistake
and
when
i
make
one
it
takes
the
form
of
lead
so
now
let
s
look
at
you
the
figures
of
a
horse
and
rider
came
slowly
through
the
eddying
mist
and
came
to
the
side
of
the
mail
where
the
passenger
stood
the
rider
stooped
and
casting
up
his
eyes
at
the
guard
handed
the
passenger
a
small
folded
paper
the
rider
s
horse
was
blown
and
both
horse
and
rider
were
covered
with
mud
from
the
hoofs
of
the
horse
to
the
hat
of
the
man
guard
said
the
passenger
in
a
tone
of
quiet
business
confidence
the
watchful
guard
with
his
right
hand
at
the
stock
of
his
raised
blunderbuss
his
left
at
the
barrel
and
his
eye
on
the
horseman
answered
curtly
sir
there
is
nothing
to
apprehend
i
belong
to
tellson
s
bank
you
must
know
tellson
s
bank
in
london
i
am
going
to
paris
on
business
a
crown
to
drink
i
may
read
this
if
so
be
as
you
re
quick
sir
he
opened
it
in
the
light
of
the
coach
lamp
on
that
side
and
read
first
to
himself
and
then
aloud
wait
at
dover
for
mam
selle
it
s
not
long
you
see
guard
jerry
say
that
my
answer
was
recalled
to
life
jerry
started
in
his
saddle
that
s
a
blazing
strange
answer
too
said
he
at
his
hoarsest
take
that
message
back
and
they
will
know
that
i
received
this
as
well
as
if
i
wrote
make
the
best
of
your
way
good
night
with
those
words
the
passenger
opened
the
coach
door
and
got
in
not
at
all
assisted
by
his
fellow
passengers
who
had
expeditiously
secreted
their
watches
and
purses
in
their
boots
and
were
now
making
a
general
pretence
of
being
asleep
with
no
more
definite
purpose
than
to
escape
the
hazard
of
originating
any
other
kind
of
action
the
coach
lumbered
on
again
with
heavier
wreaths
of
mist
closing
round
it
as
it
began
the
descent
the
guard
soon
replaced
his
blunderbuss
in
his
arm
chest
and
having
looked
to
the
rest
of
its
contents
and
having
looked
to
the
supplementary
pistols
that
he
wore
in
his
belt
looked
to
a
smaller
chest
beneath
his
seat
in
which
there
were
a
few
smith
s
tools
a
couple
of
torches
and
a
tinder
box
for
he
was
furnished
with
that
completeness
that
if
the
coach
lamps
had
been
blown
and
stormed
out
which
did
occasionally
happen
he
had
only
to
shut
himself
up
inside
keep
the
flint
and
steel
sparks
well
off
the
straw
and
get
a
light
with
tolerable
safety
and
ease
if
he
were
lucky
in
five
minutes
tom
softly
over
the
coach
roof
hallo
joe
did
you
hear
the
message
i
did
joe
what
did
you
make
of
it
tom
nothing
at
all
joe
that
s
a
coincidence
too
the
guard
mused
for
i
made
the
same
of
it
myself
jerry
left
alone
in
the
mist
and
darkness
dismounted
meanwhile
not
only
to
ease
his
spent
horse
but
to
wipe
the
mud
from
his
face
and
shake
the
wet
out
of
his
hat
brim
which
might
be
capable
of
holding
about
half
a
gallon
after
standing
with
the
bridle
over
his
heavily
splashed
arm
until
the
wheels
of
the
mail
were
no
longer
within
hearing
and
the
night
was
quite
still
again
he
turned
to
walk
down
the
hill
after
that
there
gallop
from
temple
bar
old
lady
i
won
t
trust
your
fore
legs
till
i
get
you
on
the
level
said
this
hoarse
messenger
glancing
at
his
mare
recalled
to
life
that
s
a
blazing
strange
message
much
of
that
wouldn
t
do
for
you
jerry
i
say
jerry
you
d
be
in
a
blazing
bad
way
if
recalling
to
life
was
to
come
into
fashion
jerry
iii
the
night
shadows
a
wonderful
fact
to
reflect
upon
that
every
human
creature
is
constituted
to
be
that
profound
secret
and
mystery
to
every
other
a
solemn
consideration
when
i
enter
a
great
city
by
night
that
every
one
of
those
darkly
clustered
houses
encloses
its
own
secret
that
every
room
in
every
one
of
them
encloses
its
own
secret
that
every
beating
heart
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
breasts
there
is
in
some
of
its
imaginings
a
secret
to
the
heart
nearest
it
something
of
the
awfulness
even
of
death
itself
is
referable
to
this
no
more
can
i
turn
the
leaves
of
this
dear
book
that
i
loved
and
vainly
hope
in
time
to
read
it
all
no
more
can
i
look
into
the
depths
of
this
unfathomable
water
wherein
as
momentary
lights
glanced
into
it
i
have
had
glimpses
of
buried
treasure
and
other
things
submerged
it
was
appointed
that
the
book
should
shut
with
a
spring
for
ever
and
for
ever
when
i
had
read
but
a
page
it
was
appointed
that
the
water
should
be
locked
in
an
eternal
frost
when
the
light
was
playing
on
its
surface
and
i
stood
in
ignorance
on
the
shore
my
friend
is
dead
my
neighbour
is
dead
my
love
the
darling
of
my
soul
is
dead
it
is
the
inexorable
consolidation
and
perpetuation
of
the
secret
that
was
always
in
that
individuality
and
which
i
shall
carry
in
mine
to
my
life
s
end
in
any
of
the
burial
places
of
this
city
through
which
i
pass
is
there
a
sleeper
more
inscrutable
than
its
busy
inhabitants
are
in
their
innermost
personality
to
me
or
than
i
am
to
them
as
to
this
his
natural
and
not
to
be
alienated
inheritance
the
messenger
on
horseback
had
exactly
the
same
possessions
as
the
king
the
first
minister
of
state
or
the
richest
merchant
in
london
so
with
the
three
passengers
shut
up
in
the
narrow
compass
of
one
lumbering
old
mail
coach
they
were
mysteries
to
one
another
as
complete
as
if
each
had
been
in
his
own
coach
and
six
or
his
own
coach
and
sixty
with
the
breadth
of
a
county
between
him
and
the
next
the
messenger
rode
back
at
an
easy
trot
stopping
pretty
often
at
ale
houses
by
the
way
to
drink
but
evincing
a
tendency
to
keep
his
own
counsel
and
to
keep
his
hat
cocked
over
his
eyes
he
had
eyes
that
assorted
very
well
with
that
decoration
being
of
a
surface
black
with
no
depth
in
the
colour
or
form
and
much
too
near
together
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
being
found
out
in
something
singly
if
they
kept
too
far
apart
they
had
a
sinister
expression
under
an
old
cocked
hat
like
a
three
cornered
spittoon
and
over
a
great
muffler
for
the
chin
and
throat
which
descended
nearly
to
the
wearer
s
knees
when
he
stopped
for
drink
he
moved
this
muffler
with
his
left
hand
only
while
he
poured
his
liquor
in
with
his
right
as
soon
as
that
was
done
he
muffled
again
no
jerry
no
said
the
messenger
harping
on
one
theme
as
he
rode
it
wouldn
t
do
for
you
jerry
jerry
you
honest
tradesman
it
wouldn
t
suit
your
line
of
business
recalled
bust
me
if
i
don
t
think
he
d
been
a
drinking
his
message
perplexed
his
mind
to
that
degree
that
he
was
fain
several
times
to
take
off
his
hat
to
scratch
his
head
except
on
the
crown
which
was
raggedly
bald
he
had
stiff
black
hair
standing
jaggedly
all
over
it
and
growing
down
hill
almost
to
his
broad
blunt
nose
it
was
so
like
smith
s
work
so
much
more
like
the
top
of
a
strongly
spiked
wall
than
a
head
of
hair
that
the
best
of
players
at
leap
frog
might
have
declined
him
as
the
most
dangerous
man
in
the
world
to
go
over
while
he
trotted
back
with
the
message
he
was
to
deliver
to
the
night
watchman
in
his
box
at
the
door
of
tellson
s
bank
by
temple
bar
who
was
to
deliver
it
to
greater
authorities
within
the
shadows
of
the
night
took
such
shapes
to
him
as
arose
out
of
the
message
and
took
such
shapes
to
the
mare
as
arose
out
of
her
private
topics
of
uneasiness
they
seemed
to
be
numerous
for
she
shied
at
every
shadow
on
the
road
what
time
the
mail
coach
lumbered
jolted
rattled
and
bumped
upon
its
tedious
way
with
its
three
fellow
inscrutables
inside
to
whom
likewise
the
shadows
of
the
night
revealed
themselves
in
the
forms
their
dozing
eyes
and
wandering
thoughts
suggested
tellson
s
bank
had
a
run
upon
it
in
the
mail
as
the
bank
passenger
with
an
arm
drawn
through
the
leathern
strap
which
did
what
lay
in
it
to
keep
him
from
pounding
against
the
next
passenger
and
driving
him
into
his
corner
whenever
the
coach
got
a
special
jolt
nodded
in
his
place
with
half
shut
eyes
the
little
coach
windows
and
the
coach
lamp
dimly
gleaming
through
them
and
the
bulky
bundle
of
opposite
passenger
became
the
bank
and
did
a
great
stroke
of
business
the
rattle
of
the
harness
was
the
chink
of
money
and
more
drafts
were
honoured
in
five
minutes
than
even
tellson
s
with
all
its
foreign
and
home
connection
ever
paid
in
thrice
the
time
then
the
strong
rooms
underground
at
tellson
s
with
such
of
their
valuable
stores
and
secrets
as
were
known
to
the
passenger
and
it
was
not
a
little
that
he
knew
about
them
opened
before
him
and
he
went
in
among
them
with
the
great
keys
and
the
feebly
burning
candle
and
found
them
safe
and
strong
and
sound
and
still
just
as
he
had
last
seen
them
but
though
the
bank
was
almost
always
with
him
and
though
the
coach
in
a
confused
way
like
the
presence
of
pain
under
an
opiate
was
always
with
him
there
was
another
current
of
impression
that
never
ceased
to
run
all
through
the
night
he
was
on
his
way
to
dig
some
one
out
of
a
grave
now
which
of
the
multitude
of
faces
that
showed
themselves
before
him
was
the
true
face
of
the
buried
person
the
shadows
of
the
night
did
not
indicate
but
they
were
all
the
faces
of
a
man
of
five
and
forty
by
years
and
they
differed
principally
in
the
passions
they
expressed
and
in
the
ghastliness
of
their
worn
and
wasted
state
pride
contempt
defiance
stubbornness
submission
lamentation
succeeded
one
another
so
did
varieties
of
sunken
cheek
cadaverous
colour
emaciated
hands
and
figures
but
the
face
was
in
the
main
one
face
and
every
head
was
prematurely
white
a
hundred
times
the
dozing
passenger
inquired
of
this
spectre
buried
how
long
the
answer
was
always
the
same
almost
eighteen
years
you
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
being
dug
out
long
ago
you
know
that
you
are
recalled
to
life
they
tell
me
so
i
hope
you
care
to
live
i
can
t
say
shall
i
show
her
to
you
will
you
come
and
see
her
the
answers
to
this
question
were
various
and
contradictory
sometimes
the
broken
reply
was
wait
it
would
kill
me
if
i
saw
her
too
soon
sometimes
it
was
given
in
a
tender
rain
of
tears
and
then
it
was
take
me
to
her
sometimes
it
was
staring
and
bewildered
and
then
it
was
i
don
t
know
her
i
don
t
understand
after
such
imaginary
discourse
the
passenger
in
his
fancy
would
dig
and
dig
dig
now
with
a
spade
now
with
a
great
key
now
with
his
hands
to
dig
this
wretched
creature
out
got
out
at
last
with
earth
hanging
about
his
face
and
hair
he
would
suddenly
fan
away
to
dust
the
passenger
would
then
start
to
himself
and
lower
the
window
to
get
the
reality
of
mist
and
rain
on
his
cheek
yet
even
when
his
eyes
were
opened
on
the
mist
and
rain
on
the
moving
patch
of
light
from
the
lamps
and
the
hedge
at
the
roadside
retreating
by
jerks
the
night
shadows
outside
the
coach
would
fall
into
the
train
of
the
night
shadows
within
the
real
banking
house
by
temple
bar
the
real
business
of
the
past
day
the
real
strong
rooms
the
real
express
sent
after
him
and
the
real
message
returned
would
all
be
there
out
of
the
midst
of
them
the
ghostly
face
would
rise
and
he
would
accost
it
again
buried
how
long
almost
eighteen
years
i
hope
you
care
to
live
i
can
t
say
dig
dig
dig
until
an
impatient
movement
from
one
of
the
two
passengers
would
admonish
him
to
pull
up
the
window
draw
his
arm
securely
through
the
leathern
strap
and
speculate
upon
the
two
slumbering
forms
until
his
mind
lost
its
hold
of
them
and
they
again
slid
away
into
the
bank
and
the
grave
buried
how
long
almost
eighteen
years
you
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
being
dug
out
long
ago
the
words
were
still
in
his
hearing
as
just
spoken
distinctly
in
his
hearing
as
ever
spoken
words
had
been
in
his
life
when
the
weary
passenger
started
to
the
consciousness
of
daylight
and
found
that
the
shadows
of
the
night
were
gone
he
lowered
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
rising
sun
there
was
a
ridge
of
ploughed
land
with
a
plough
upon
it
where
it
had
been
left
last
night
when
the
horses
were
unyoked
beyond
a
quiet
coppice
wood
in
which
many
leaves
of
burning
red
and
golden
yellow
still
remained
upon
the
trees
though
the
earth
was
cold
and
wet
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
sun
rose
bright
placid
and
beautiful
eighteen
years
said
the
passenger
looking
at
the
sun
gracious
creator
of
day
to
be
buried
alive
for
eighteen
years
iv
the
preparation
when
the
mail
got
successfully
to
dover
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
the
head
drawer
at
the
royal
george
hotel
opened
the
coach
door
as
his
custom
was
he
did
it
with
some
flourish
of
ceremony
for
a
mail
journey
from
london
in
winter
was
an
achievement
to
congratulate
an
adventurous
traveller
upon
by
that
time
there
was
only
one
adventurous
traveller
left
be
congratulated
for
the
two
others
had
been
set
down
at
their
respective
roadside
destinations
the
mildewy
inside
of
the
coach
with
its
damp
and
dirty
straw
its
disagreeable
smell
and
its
obscurity
was
rather
like
a
larger
dog
kennel
mr
lorry
the
passenger
shaking
himself
out
of
it
in
chains
of
straw
a
tangle
of
shaggy
wrapper
flapping
hat
and
muddy
legs
was
rather
like
a
larger
sort
of
dog
there
will
be
a
packet
to
calais
tomorrow
drawer
yes
sir
if
the
weather

the

always
heavily
wrapped
up
from
head
to
foot
the
room
had
the
odd
interest
for
the
establishment
of
the
royal
george
that
although
but
one
kind
of
man
was
seen
to
go
into
it
all
kinds
and
varieties
of
men
came
out
of
it
consequently
another
drawer
and
two
porters
and
several
maids
and
the
landlady
were
all
loitering
by
accident
at
various
points
of
the
road
between
the
concord
and
the
coffee
room
when
a
gentleman
of
sixty
formally
dressed
in
a
brown
suit
of
clothes
pretty
well
worn
but
very
well
kept
with
large
square
cuffs
and
large
flaps
to
the
pockets
passed
along
on
his
way
to
his
breakfast
the
coffee
room
had
no
other
occupant
that
forenoon
than
the
gentleman
in
brown
his
breakfast
table
was
drawn
before
the
fire
and
as
he
sat
with
its
light
shining
on
him
waiting
for
the
meal
he
sat
so
still
that
he
might
have
been
sitting
for
his
portrait
very
orderly
and
methodical
he
looked
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
and
a
loud
watch
ticking
a
sonorous
sermon
under
his
flapped
waist
coat
as
though
it
pitted
its
gravity
and
longevity
against
the
levity
and
evanescence
of
the
brisk
fire
he
had
a
good
leg
and
was
a
little
vain
of
it
for
his
brown
stockings
fitted
sleek
and
close
and
were
of
a
fine
texture
his
shoes
and
buckles
too
though
plain
were
trim
he
wore
an
odd
little
sleek
crisp
flaxen
wig
setting
very
close
to
his
head
which
wig
it
is
to
be
presumed
was
made
of
hair
but
which
looked
far
more
as
though
it
were
spun
from
filaments
of
silk
or
glass
his
linen
though
not
of
a
fineness
in
accordance
with
his
stockings
was
as
white
as
the
tops
of
the
waves
that
broke
upon
the
neighbouring
beach
or
the
specks
of
sail
that
glinted
in
the
sunlight
far
at
sea
a
face
habitually
suppressed
and
quieted
was
still
lighted
up
under
the
quaint
wig
by
a
pair
of
moist
bright
eyes
that
it
must
have
cost
their
owner
in
years
gone
by
some
pains
to
drill
to
the
composed
and
reserved
expression
of
tellson
s
bank
he
had
a
healthy
colour
in
his
cheeks
and
his
face
though
lined
bore
few
traces
of
anxiety
but
perhaps
the
confidential
bachelor
clerks
in
tellson
s
bank
were
principally
occupied
with
the
cares
of
other
people
and
perhaps
second
hand
cares
like
second
hand
clothes
come
easily
off
and
on
completing
his
resemblance
to
a
man
who
was
sitting
for
his
portrait
mr
lorry
dropped
off
to
sleep
the
arrival
of
his
breakfast
roused
him
and
he
said
to
the
drawer
as
he
moved
his
chair
to
it
i
wish
accommodation
prepared
for
a
young
lady
who
may
come
here
at
any
time
to
day
she
may
ask
for
mr
jarvis
lorry
or
she
may
only
ask
for
a
gentleman
from
tellson
s
bank
please
to
let
me
know
yes
sir
tellson
s
bank
in
london
sir
yes
yes
sir
we
have
oftentimes
the
honour
to
entertain
your
gentlemen
in
their
travelling
backwards
and
forwards
betwixt
london
and
paris
sir
a
vast
deal
of
travelling
sir
in
tellson
and
company
s
house
yes
we
are
quite
a
french
house
as
well
as
an
english
one
yes
sir
not
much
in
the
habit
of
such
travelling
yourself
i
think
sir
not
of
late
years
it
is
fifteen
years
since
we
since
i
came
last
from
france
indeed
sir
that
was
before
my
time
here
sir
before
our
people
s
time
here
sir
the
george
was
in
other
hands
at
that
time
sir
i
believe
so
but
i
would
hold
a
pretty
wager
sir
that
a
house
like
tellson
and
company
was
flourishing
a
matter
of
fifty
not
to
speak
of
fifteen
years
ago
you
might
treble
that
and
say
a
hundred
and
fifty
yet
not
be
far
from
the
truth
indeed
sir
rounding
his
mouth
and
both
his
eyes
as
he
stepped
backward
from
the
table
the
waiter
shifted
his
napkin
from
his
right
arm
to
his
left
dropped
into
a
comfortable
attitude
and
stood
surveying
the
guest
while
he
ate
and
drank
as
from
an
observatory
or
watchtower
according
to
the
immemorial
usage
of
waiters
in
all
ages
when
mr
lorry
had
finished
his
breakfast
he
went
out
for
a
stroll
on
the
beach
the
little
narrow
crooked
town
of
dover
hid
itself
away
from
the
beach
and
ran
its
head
into
the
chalk
cliffs
like
a
marine
ostrich
the
beach
was
a
desert
of
heaps
of
sea
and
stones
tumbling
wildly
about
and
the
sea
did
what
it
liked
and
what
it
liked
was
destruction
it
thundered
at
the
town
and
thundered
at
the
cliffs
and
brought
the
coast
down
madly
the
air
among
the
houses
was
of
so
strong
a
piscatory
flavour
that
one
might
have
supposed
sick
fish
went
up
to
be
dipped
in
it
as
sick
people
went
down
to
be
dipped
in
the
sea
a
little
fishing
was
done
in
the
port
and
a
quantity
of
strolling
about
by
night
and
looking
seaward
particularly
at
those
times
when
the
tide
made
and
was
near
flood
small
tradesmen
who
did
no
business
whatever
sometimes
unaccountably
realised
large
fortunes
and
it
was
remarkable
that
nobody
in
the
neighbourhood
could
endure
a
lamplighter
as
the
day
declined
into
the
afternoon
and
the
air
which
had
been
at
intervals
clear
enough
to
allow
the
french
coast
to
be
seen
became
again
charged
with
mist
and
vapour
mr
lorry
s
thoughts
seemed
to
cloud
too
when
it
was
dark
and
he
sat
before
the
coffee
room
fire
awaiting
his
dinner
as
he
had
awaited
his
breakfast
his
mind
was
busily
digging
digging
digging
in
the
live
red
coals
a
bottle
of
good
claret
after
dinner
does
a
digger
in
the
red
coals
no
harm
otherwise
than
as
it
has
a
tendency
to
throw
him
out
of
work
mr
lorry
had
been
idle
a
long
time
and
had
just
poured
out
his
last
glassful
of
wine
with
as
complete
an
appearance
of
satisfaction
as
is
ever
to
be
found
in
an
elderly
gentleman
of
a
fresh
complexion
who
has
got
to
the
end
of
a
bottle
when
a
rattling
of
wheels
came
up
the
narrow
street
and
rumbled
into
the
inn
yard
he
set
down
his
glass
untouched
this
is
mam
selle
said
he
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
waiter
came
in
to
announce
that
miss
manette
had
arrived
from
london
and
would
be
happy
to
see
the
gentleman
from
tellson
s
so
soon
miss
manette
had
taken
some
refreshment
on
the
road
and
required
none
then
and
was
extremely
anxious
to
see
the
gentleman
from
tellson
s
immediately
if
it
suited
his
pleasure
and
convenience
the
gentleman
from
tellson
s
had
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
empty
his
glass
with
an
air
of
stolid
desperation
settle
his
odd
little
flaxen
wig
at
the
ears
and
follow
the
waiter
to
miss
manette
s
apartment
it
was
a
large
dark
room
furnished
in
a
funereal
manner
with
black
horsehair
and
loaded
with
heavy
dark
tables
these
had
been
oiled
and
oiled
until
the
two
tall
candles
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
were
gloomily
reflected
on
every
leaf
as
if
they
were
buried
in
deep
graves
of
black
mahogany
and
no
light
to
speak
of
could
be
expected
from
them
until
they
were
dug
out
the
obscurity
was
so
difficult
to
penetrate
that
mr
lorry
picking
his
way
over
the
well
worn
turkey
carpet
supposed
miss
manette
to
be
for
the
moment
in
some
adjacent
room
until
having
got
past
the
two
tall
candles
he
saw
standing
to
receive
him
by
the
table
between
them
and
the
fire
a
young
lady
of
not
more
than
seventeen
in
a
riding
cloak
and
still
holding
her
straw
travelling
hat
by
its
ribbon
in
her
hand
as
his
eyes
rested
on
a
short
slight
pretty
figure
a
quantity
of
golden
hair
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
that
met
his
own
with
an
inquiring
look
and
a
forehead
with
a
singular
capacity
remembering
how
young
and
smooth
it
was
of
rifting
and
knitting
itself
into
an
expression
that
was
not
quite
one
of
perplexity
or
wonder
or
alarm
or
merely
of
a
bright
fixed
attention
though
it
included
all
the
four
expressions
as
his
eyes
rested
on
these
things
a
sudden
vivid
likeness
passed
before
him
of
a
child
whom
he
had
held
in
his
arms
on
the
passage
across
that
very
channel
one
cold
time
when
the
hail
drifted
heavily
and
the
sea
ran
high
the
likeness
passed
away
like
a
breath
along
the
surface
of
the
gaunt
pier
glass
behind
her
on
the
frame
of
which
a
hospital
procession
of
negro
cupids
several
headless
and
all
cripples
were
offering
black
baskets
of
dead
sea
fruit
to
black
divinities
of
the
feminine
gender
and
he
made
his
formal
bow
to
miss
manette
pray
take
a
seat
sir
in
a
very
clear
and
pleasant
young
voice
a
little
foreign
in
its
accent
but
a
very
little
indeed
i
kiss
your
hand
miss
said
mr
lorry
with
the
manners
of
an
earlier
date
as
he
made
his
formal
bow
again
and
took
his
seat
i
received
a
letter
from
the
bank
sir
yesterday
informing
me
that
some
intelligence
or
discovery
the
word
is
not
material
miss
either
word
will
do
respecting
the
small
property
of
my
poor
father
whom
i
never
saw
so
long
dead
mr
lorry
moved
in
his
chair
and
cast
a
troubled
look
towards
the
hospital
procession
of
negro
cupids
as
if
they
had
any
help
for
anybody
in
their
absurd
baskets
rendered
it
necessary
that
i
should
go
to
paris
there
to
communicate
with
a
gentleman
of
the
bank
so
good
as
to
be
despatched
to
paris
for
the
purpose
myself
as
i
was
prepared
to
hear
sir
she
curtseyed
to
him
young
ladies
made
curtseys
in
those
days
with
a
pretty
desire
to
convey
to
him
that
she
felt
how
much
older
and
wiser
he
was
than
she
he
made
her
another
bow
i
replied
to
the
bank
sir
that
as
it
was
considered
necessary
by
those
who
know
and
who
are
so
kind
as
to
advise
me
that
i
should
go
to
france
and
that
as
i
am
an
orphan
and
have
no
friend
who
could
go
with
me
i
should
esteem
it
highly
if
i
might
be
permitted
to
place
myself
during
the
journey
under
that
worthy
gentleman
s
protection
the
gentleman
had
left
london
but
i
think
a
messenger
was
sent
after
him
to
beg
the
favour
of
his
waiting
for
me
here
i
was
happy
said
mr
lorry
to
be
entrusted
with
the
charge
i
shall
be
more
happy
to
execute
it
sir
i
thank
you
indeed
i
thank
you
very
gratefully
it
was
told
me
by
the
bank
that
the
gentleman
would
explain
to
me
the
details
of
the
business
and
that
i
must
prepare
myself
to
find
them
of
a
surprising
nature
i
have
done
my
best
to
prepare
myself
and
i
naturally
have
a
strong
and
eager
interest
to
know
what
they
are
naturally
said
mr
lorry
yes
i
after
a
pause
he
added
again
settling
the
crisp
flaxen
wig
at
the
ears
it
is
very
difficult
to
begin
he
did
not
begin
but
in
his
indecision
met
her
glance
the
young
forehead
lifted
itself
into
that
singular
expression
but
it
was
pretty
and
characteristic
besides
being
singular
and
she
raised
her
hand
as
if
with
an
involuntary
action
she
caught
at
or
stayed
some
passing
shadow
are
you
quite
a
stranger
to
me
sir
am
i
not
mr
lorry
opened
his
hands
and
extended
them
outwards
with
an
argumentative
smile
between
the
eyebrows
and
just
over
the
little
feminine
nose
the
line
of
which
was
as
delicate
and
fine
as
it
was
possible
to
be
the
expression
deepened
itself
as
she
took
her
seat
thoughtfully
in
the
chair
by
which
she
had
hitherto
remained
standing
he
watched
her
as
she
mused
and
the
moment
she
raised
her
eyes
again
went
on
in
your
adopted
country
i
presume
i
cannot
do
better
than
address
you
as
a
young
english
lady
miss
manette
if
you
please
sir
miss
manette
i
am
a
man
of
business
i
have
a
business
charge
to
acquit
myself
of
in
your
reception
of
it
don
t
heed
me
any
more
than
if
i
was
a
speaking
machine
truly
i
am
not
much
else
i
will
with
your
leave
relate
to
you
miss
the
story
of
one
of
our
customers
story
he
seemed
wilfully
to
mistake
the
word
she
had
repeated
when
he
added
in
a
hurry
yes
customers
in
the
banking
business
we
usually
call
our
connection
our
customers
he
was
a
french
gentleman
a
scientific
gentleman
a
man
of
great
acquirements
a
doctor
not
of
beauvais
why
yes
of
beauvais
like
monsieur
manette
your
father
the
gentleman
was
of
beauvais
like
monsieur
manette
your
father
the
gentleman
was
of
repute
in
paris
i
had
the
honour
of
knowing
him
there
our
relations
were
business
relations
but
confidential
i
was
at
that
time
in
our
french
house
and
had
been
oh
twenty
years
at
that
time
i
may
ask
at
what
time
sir
i
speak
miss
of
twenty
years
ago
he
married
an
english
lady
and
i
was
one
of
the
trustees
his
affairs
like
the
affairs
of
many
other
french
gentlemen
and
french
families
were
entirely
in
tellson
s
hands
in
a
similar
way
i
am
or
i
have
been
trustee
of
one
kind
or
other
for
scores
of
our
customers
these
are
mere
business
relations
miss
there
is
no
friendship
in
them
no
particular
interest
nothing
like
sentiment
i
have
passed
from
one
to
another
in
the
course
of
my
business
life
just
as
i
pass
from
one
of
our
customers
to
another
in
the
course
of
my
business
day
in
short
i
have
no
feelings
i
am
a
mere
machine
to
go
on
but
this
is
my
father
s
story
sir
and
i
begin
to
think
the
curiously
roughened
forehead
was
very
intent
upon
him
that
when
i
was
left
an
orphan
through
my
mother
s
surviving
my
father
only
two
years
it
was
you
who
brought
me
to
england
i
am
almost
sure
it
was
you
mr
lorry
took
the
hesitating
little
hand
that
confidingly
advanced
to
take
his
and
he
put
it
with
some
ceremony
to
his
lips
he
then
conducted
the
young
lady
straightway
to
her
chair
again
and
holding
the
chair
back
with
his
left
hand
and
using
his
right
by
turns
to
rub
his
chin
pull
his
wig
at
the
ears
or
point
what
he
said
stood
looking
down
into
her
face
while
she
sat
looking
up
into
his
miss
manette
it
was
i
and
you
will
see
how
truly
i
spoke
of
myself
just
now
in
saying
i
had
no
feelings
and
that
all
the
relations
i
hold
with
my
fellow
creatures
are
mere
business
relations
when
you
reflect
that
i
have
never
seen
you
since
no
you
have
been
the
ward
of
tellson
s
house
since
and
i
have
been
busy
with
the
other
business
of
tellson
s
house
since
feelings
i
have
no
time
for
them
no
chance
of
them
i
pass
my
whole
life
miss
in
turning
an
immense
pecuniary
mangle
after
this
odd
description
of
his
daily
routine
of
employment
mr
lorry
flattened
his
flaxen
wig
upon
his
head
with
both
hands
which
was
most
unnecessary
for
nothing
could
be
flatter
than
its
shining
surface
was
before
and
resumed
his
former
attitude
so
far
miss
as
you
have
remarked
this
is
the
story
of
your
regretted
father
now
comes
the
difference
if
your
father
had
not
died
when
he
did
don
t
be
frightened
how
you
start
she
did
indeed
start
and
she
caught
his
wrist
with
both
her
hands
pray
said
mr
lorry
in
a
soothing
tone
bringing
his
left
hand
from
the
back
of
the
chair
to
lay
it
on
the
supplicatory
fingers
that
clasped
him
in
so
violent
a
tremble
pray
control
your
agitation
a
matter
of
business
as
i
was
saying
her
look
so
discomposed
him
that
he
stopped
wandered
and
began
anew
as
i
was
saying
if
monsieur
manette
had
not
died
if
he
had
suddenly
and
silently
disappeared
if
he
had
been
spirited
away
if
it
had
not
been
difficult
to
guess
to
what
dreadful
place
though
no
art
could
trace
him
if
he
had
an
enemy
in
some
compatriot
who
could
exercise
a
privilege
that
i
in
my
own
time
have
known
the
boldest
people
afraid
to
speak
of
in
a
whisper
across
the
water
there
for
instance
the
privilege
of
filling
up
blank
forms
for
the
consignment
of
any
one
to
the
oblivion
of
a
prison
for
any
length
of
time
if
his
wife
had
implored
the
king
the
queen
the
court
the
clergy
for
any
tidings
of
him
and
all
quite
in
vain
then
the
history
of
your
father
would
have
been
the
history
of
this
unfortunate
gentleman
the
doctor
of
beauvais
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
more
sir
i
will
i
am
going
to
you
can
bear
it
i
can
bear
anything
but
the
uncertainty
you
leave
me
in
at
this
moment
you
speak
collectedly
and
you
are
collected
that
s
good
though
his
manner
was
less
satisfied
than
his
words
a
matter
of
business
regard
it
as
a
matter
of
business
business
that
must
be
done
now
if
this
doctor
s
wife
though
a
lady
of
great
courage
and
spirit
had
suffered
so
intensely
from
this
cause
before
her
little
child
was
born
the
little
child
was
a
daughter
sir
a
daughter
a
a
matter
of
business
don
t
be
distressed
miss
if
the
poor
lady
had
suffered
so
intensely
before
her
little
child
was
born
that
she
came
to
the
determination
of
sparing
the
poor
child
the
inheritance
of
any
part
of
the
agony
she
had
known
the
pains
of
by
rearing
her
in
the
belief
that
her
father
was
dead
no
don
t
kneel
in
heaven
s
name
why
should
you
kneel
to
me
for
the
truth
o
dear
good
compassionate
sir
for
the
truth
a
a
matter
of
business
you
confuse
me
and
how
can
i
transact
business
if
i
am
confused
let
us
be
clear
headed
if
you
could
kindly
mention
now
for
instance
what
nine
times
ninepence
are
or
how
many
shillings
in
twenty
guineas
it
would
be
so
encouraging
i
should
be
so
much
more
at
my
ease
about
your
state
of
mind
without
directly
answering
to
this
appeal
she
sat
so
still
when
he
had
very
gently
raised
her
and
the
hands
that
had
not
ceased
to
clasp
his
wrists
were
so
much
more
steady
than
they
had
been
that
she
communicated
some
reassurance
to
mr
jarvis
lorry
that
s
right
that
s
right
courage
business
you
have
business
before
you
useful
business
miss
manette
your
mother
took
this
course
with
you
and
when
she
died
i
believe
broken
hearted
having
never
slackened
her
unavailing
search
for
your
father
she
left
you
at
two
years
old
to
grow
to
be
blooming
beautiful
and
happy
without
the
dark
cloud
upon
you
of
living
in
uncertainty
whether
your
father
soon
wore
his
heart
out
in
prison
or
wasted
there
through
many
lingering
years
as
he
said
the
words
he
looked
down
with
an
admiring
pity
on
the
flowing
golden
hair
as
if
he
pictured
to
himself
that
it
might
have
been
already
tinged
with
grey
you
know
that
your
parents
had
no
great
possession
and
that
what
they
had
was
secured
to
your
mother
and
to
you
there
has
been
no
new
discovery
of
money
or
of
any
other
property
but
he
felt
his
wrist
held
closer
and
he
stopped
the
expression
in
the
forehead
which
had
so
particularly
attracted
his
notice
and
which
was
now
immovable
had
deepened
into
one
of
pain
and
horror
but
he
has
been
been
found
he
is
alive
greatly
changed
it
is
too
probable
almost
a
wreck
it
is
possible
though
we
will
hope
the
best
still
alive
your
father
has
been
taken
to
the
house
of
an
old
servant
in
paris
and
we
are
going
there
i
to
identify
him
if
i
can
you
to
restore
him
to
life
love
duty
rest
comfort
a
shiver
ran
through
her
frame
and
from
it
through
his
she
said
in
a
low
distinct
awe
stricken
voice
as
if
she
were
saying
it
in
a
dream
i
am
going
to
see
his
ghost
it
will
be
his
ghost
not
him
mr
lorry
quietly
chafed
the
hands
that
held
his
arm
there
there
there
see
now
see
now
the
best
and
the
worst
are
known
to
you
now
you
are
well
on
your
way
to
the
poor
wronged
gentleman
and
with
a
fair
sea
voyage
and
a
fair
land
journey
you
will
be
soon
at
his
dear
side
she
repeated
in
the
same
tone
sunk
to
a
whisper
i
have
been
free
i
have
been
happy
yet
his
ghost
has
never
haunted
me
only
one
thing
more
said
mr
lorry
laying
stress
upon
it
as
a
wholesome
means
of
enforcing
her
attention
he
has
been
found
under
another
name
his
own
long
forgotten
or
long
concealed
it
would
be
worse
than
useless
now
to
inquire
which
worse
than
useless
to
seek
to
know
whether
he
has
been
for
years
overlooked
or
always
designedly
held
prisoner
it
would
be
worse
than
useless
now
to
make
any
inquiries
because
it
would
be
dangerous
better
not
to
mention
the
subject
anywhere
or
in
any
way
and
to
remove
him
for
a
while
at
all
events
out
of
france
even
i
safe
as
an
englishman
and
even
tellson
s
important
as
they
are
to
french
credit
avoid
all
naming
of
the
matter
i
carry
about
me
not
a
scrap
of
writing
openly
referring
to
it
this
is
a
secret
service
altogether
my
credentials
entries
and
memoranda
are
all
comprehended
in
the
one
line
recalled
to
life
which
may
mean
anything
but
what
is
the
matter
she
doesn
t
notice
a
word
miss
manette
perfectly
still
and
silent
and
not
even
fallen
back
in
her
chair
she
sat
under
his
hand
utterly
insensible
with
her
eyes
open
and
fixed
upon
him
and
with
that
last
expression
looking
as
if
it
were
carved
or
branded
into
her
forehead
so
close
was
her
hold
upon
his
arm
that
he
feared
to
detach
himself
lest
he
should
hurt
her
therefore
he
called
out
loudly
for
assistance
without
moving
a
wild
looking
woman
whom
even
in
his
agitation
mr
lorry
observed
to
be
all
of
a
red
colour
and
to
have
red
hair
and
to
be
dressed
in
some
extraordinary
tight
fitting
fashion
and
to
have
on
her
head
a
most
wonderful
bonnet
like
a
grenadier
wooden
measure
and
good
measure
too
or
a
great
stilton
cheese
came
running
into
the
room
in
advance
of
the
inn
servants
and
soon
settled
the
question
of
his
detachment
from
the
poor
young
lady
by
laying
a
brawny
hand
upon
his
chest
and
sending
him
flying
back
against
the
nearest
wall
i
really
think
this
must
be
a
man
was
mr
lorry
s
breathless
reflection
simultaneously
with
his
coming
against
the
wall
why
look
at
you
all
bawled
this
figure
addressing
the
inn
servants
why
don
t
you
go
and
fetch
things
instead
of
standing
there
staring
at
me
i
am
not
so
much
to
look
at
am
i
why
don
t
you
go
and
fetch
things
i
ll
let
you
know
if
you
don
t
bring
smelling
salts
cold
water
and
vinegar
quick
i
will
there
was
an
immediate
dispersal
for
these
restoratives
and
she
softly
laid
the
patient
on
a
sofa
and
tended
her
with
great
skill
and
gentleness
calling
her
my
precious
and
my
bird
and
spreading
her
golden
hair
aside
over
her
shoulders
with
great
pride
and
care
and
you
in
brown
she
said
indignantly
turning
to
mr
lorry
couldn
t
you
tell
her
what
you
had
to
tell
her
without
frightening
her
to
death
look
at
her
with
her
pretty
pale
face
and
her
cold
hands
do
you
call
that
being
a
banker
mr
lorry
was
so
exceedingly
disconcerted
by
a
question
so
hard
to
answer
that
he
could
only
look
on
at
a
distance
with
much
feebler
sympathy
and
humility
while
the
strong
woman
having
banished
the
inn
servants
under
the
mysterious
penalty
of
letting
them
know
something
not
mentioned
if
they
stayed
there
staring
recovered
her
charge
by
a
regular
series
of
gradations
and
coaxed
her
to
lay
her
drooping
head
upon
her
shoulder
i
hope
she
will
do
well
now
said
mr
lorry
no
thanks
to
you
in
brown
if
she
does
my
darling
pretty
i
hope
said
mr
lorry
after
another
pause
of
feeble
sympathy
and
humility
that
you
accompany
miss
manette
to
france
a
likely
thing
too
replied
the
strong
woman
if
it
was
ever
intended
that
i
should
go
across
salt
water
do
you
suppose
providence
would
have
cast
my
lot
in
an
island
this
being
another
question
hard
to
answer
mr
jarvis
lorry
withdrew
to
consider
it
v
the
wine
shop
a
large
cask
of
wine
had
been
dropped
and
broken
in
the
street
the
accident
had
happened
in
getting
it
out
of
a
cart
the
cask
had
tumbled
out
with
a
run
the
hoops
had
burst
and
it
lay
on
the
stones
just
outside
the
door
of
the
wine
shop
shattered
like
a
walnut
shell
all
the
people
within
reach
had
suspended
their
business
or
their
idleness
to
run
to
the
spot
and
drink
the
wine
the
rough
irregular
stones
of
the
street
pointing
every
way
and
designed
one
might
have
thought
expressly
to
lame
all
living
creatures
that
approached
them
had
dammed
it
into
little
pools
these
were
surrounded
each
by
its
own
jostling
group
or
crowd
according
to
its
size
some
men
kneeled
down
made
scoops
of
their
two
hands
joined
and
sipped
or
tried
to
help
women
who
bent
over
their
shoulders
to
sip
before
the
wine
had
all
run
out
between
their
fingers
others
men
and
women
dipped
in
the
puddles
with
little
mugs
of
mutilated
earthenware
or
even
with
handkerchiefs
from
women
s
heads
which
were
squeezed
dry
into
infants
mouths
others
made
small
mud
embankments
to
stem
the
wine
as
it
ran
others
directed
by
lookers
on
up
at
high
windows
darted
here
and
there
to
cut
off
little
streams
of
wine
that
started
away
in
new
directions
others
devoted
themselves
to
the
sodden
and
lee
dyed
pieces
of
the
cask
licking
and
even
champing
the
moister
wine
rotted
fragments
with
eager
relish
there
was
no
drainage
to
carry
off
the
wine
and
not
only
did
it
all
get
taken
up
but
so
much
mud
got
taken
up
along
with
it
that
there
might
have
been
a
scavenger
in
the
street
if
anybody
acquainted
with
it
could
have
believed
in
such
a
miraculous
presence
a
shrill
sound
of
laughter
and
of
amused
voices
voices
of
men
women
and
children
resounded
in
the
street
while
this
wine
game
lasted
there
was
little
roughness
in
the
sport
and
much
playfulness
there
was
a
special
companionship
in
it
an
observable
inclination
on
the
part
of
every
one
to
join
some
other
one
which
led
especially
among
the
luckier
or
lighter
hearted
to
frolicsome
embraces
drinking
of
healths
shaking
of
hands
and
even
joining
of
hands
and
dancing
a
dozen
together
when
the
wine
was
gone
and
the
places
where
it
had
been
most
abundant
were
raked
into
a
gridiron
pattern
by
fingers
these
demonstrations
ceased
as
suddenly
as
they
had
broken
out
the
man
who
had
left
his
saw
sticking
in
the
firewood
he
was
cutting
set
it
in
motion
again
the
women
who
had
left
on
a
door
step
the
little
pot
of
hot
ashes
at
which
she
had
been
trying
to
soften
the
pain
in
her
own
starved
fingers
and
toes
or
in
those
of
her
child
returned
to
it
men
with
bare
arms
matted
locks
and
cadaverous
faces
who
had
emerged
into
the
winter
light
from
cellars
moved
away
to
descend
again
and
a
gloom
gathered
on
the
scene
that
appeared
more
natural
to
it
than
sunshine
the
wine
was
red
wine
and
had
stained
the
ground
of
the
narrow
street
in
the
suburb
of
saint
antoine
in
paris
where
it
was
spilled
it
had
stained
many
hands
too
and
many
faces
and
many
naked
feet
and
many
wooden
shoes
the
hands
of
the
man
who
sawed
the
wood
left
red
marks
on
the
billets
and
the
forehead
of
the
woman
who
nursed
her
baby
was
stained
with
the
stain
of
the
old
rag
she
wound
about
her
head
again
those
who
had
been
greedy
with
the
staves
of
the
cask
had
acquired
a
tigerish
smear
about
the
mouth
and
one
tall
joker
so
besmirched
his
head
more
out
of
a
long
squalid
bag
of
a
nightcap
than
in
it
scrawled
upon
a
wall
with
his
finger
dipped
in
muddy
wine
lees
blood
the
time
was
to
come
when
that
wine
too
would
be
spilled
on
the
street
stones
and
when
the
stain
of
it
would
be
red
upon
many
there
and
now
that
the
cloud
settled
on
saint
antoine
which
a
momentary
gleam
had
driven
from
his
sacred
countenance
the
darkness
of
it
was
heavy
cold
dirt
sickness
ignorance
and
want
were
the
lords
in
waiting
on
the
saintly
presence
nobles
of
great
power
all
of
them
but
most
especially
the
last
samples
of
a
people
that
had
undergone
a
terrible
grinding
and
regrinding
in
the
mill
and
certainly
not
in
the
fabulous
mill
which
ground
old
people
young
shivered
at
every
corner
passed
in
and
out
at
every
doorway
looked
from
every
window
fluttered
in
every
vestige
of
a
garment
that
the
wind
shook
the
mill
which
had
worked
them
down
was
the
mill
that
grinds
young
people
old
the
children
had
ancient
faces
and
grave
voices
and
upon
them
and
upon
the
grown
faces
and
ploughed
into
every
furrow
of
age
and
coming
up
afresh
was
the
sigh
hunger
it
was
prevalent
everywhere
hunger
was
pushed
out
of
the
tall
houses
in
the
wretched
clothing
that
hung
upon
poles
and
lines
hunger
was
patched
into
them
with
straw
and
rag
and
wood
and
paper
hunger
was
repeated
in
every
fragment
of
the
small
modicum
of
firewood
that
the
man
sawed
off
hunger
stared
down
from
the
smokeless
chimneys
and
started
up
from
the
filthy
street
that
had
no
offal
among
its
refuse
of
anything
to
eat
hunger
was
the
inscription
on
the
baker
s
shelves
written
in
every
small
loaf
of
his
scanty
stock
of
bad
bread
at
the
sausage
shop
in
every
dead
dog
preparation
that
was
offered
for
sale
hunger
rattled
its
dry
bones
among
the
roasting
chestnuts
in
the
turned
cylinder
hunger
was
shred
into
atomics
in
every
farthing
porringer
of
husky
chips
of
potato
fried
with
some
reluctant
drops
of
oil
its
abiding
place
was
in
all
things
fitted
to
it
a
narrow
winding
street
full
of
offence
and
stench
with
other
narrow
winding
streets
diverging
all
peopled
by
rags
and
nightcaps
and
all
smelling
of
rags
and
nightcaps
and
all
visible
things
with
a
brooding
look
upon
them
that
looked
ill
in
the
hunted
air
of
the
people
there
was
yet
some
wild
beast
thought
of
the
possibility
of
turning
at
bay
depressed
and
slinking
though
they
were
eyes
of
fire
were
not
wanting
among
them
nor
compressed
lips
white
with
what
they
suppressed
nor
foreheads
knitted
into
the
likeness
of
the
gallows
rope
they
mused
about
enduring
or
inflicting
the
trade
signs
and
they
were
almost
as
many
as
the
shops
were
all
grim
illustrations
of
want
the
butcher
and
the
porkman
painted
up
only
the
leanest
scrags
of
meat
the
baker
the
coarsest
of
meagre
loaves
the
people
rudely
pictured
as
drinking
in
the
wine
shops
croaked
over
their
scanty
measures
of
thin
wine
and
beer
and
were
gloweringly
confidential
together
nothing
was
represented
in
a
flourishing
condition
save
tools
and
weapons
but
the
cutler
s
knives
and
axes
were
sharp
and
bright
the
smith
s
hammers
were
heavy
and
the
gunmaker
s
stock
was
murderous
the
crippling
stones
of
the
pavement
with
their
many
little
reservoirs
of
mud
and
water
had
no
footways
but
broke
off
abruptly
at
the
doors
the
kennel
to
make
amends
ran
down
the
middle
of
the
street
when
it
ran
at
all
which
was
only
after
heavy
rains
and
then
it
ran
by
many
eccentric
fits
into
the
houses
across
the
streets
at
wide
intervals
one
clumsy
lamp
was
slung
by
a
rope
and
pulley
at
night
when
the
lamplighter
had
let
these
down
and
lighted
and
hoisted
them
again
a
feeble
grove
of
dim
wicks
swung
in
a
sickly
manner
overhead
as
if
they
were
at
sea
indeed
they
were
at
sea
and
the
ship
and
crew
were
in
peril
of
tempest
for
the
time
was
to
come
when
the
gaunt
scarecrows
of
that
region
should
have
watched
the
lamplighter
in
their
idleness
and
hunger
so
long
as
to
conceive
the
idea
of
improving
on
his
method
and
hauling
up
men
by
those
ropes
and
pulleys
to
flare
upon
the
darkness
of
their
condition
but
the
time
was
not
come
yet
and
every
wind
that
blew
over
france
shook
the
rags
of
the
scarecrows
in
vain
for
the
birds
fine
of
song
and
feather
took
no
warning
the
wine
shop
was
a
corner
shop
better
than
most
others
in
its
appearance
and
degree
and
the
master
of
the
wine
shop
had
stood
outside
it
in
a
yellow
waistcoat
and
green
breeches
looking
on
at
the
struggle
for
the
lost
wine
it
s
not
my
affair
said
he
with
a
final
shrug
of
the
shoulders
the
people
from
the
market
did
it
let
them
bring
another
there
his
eyes
happening
to
catch
the
tall
joker
writing
up
his
joke
he
called
to
him
across
the
way
say
then
my
gaspard
what
do
you
do
there
the
fellow
pointed
to
his
joke
with
immense
significance
as
is
often
the
way
with
his
tribe
it
missed
its
mark
and
completely
failed
as
is
often
the
way
with
his
tribe
too
what
now
are
you
a
subject
for
the
mad
hospital
said
the
wine
shop
keeper
crossing
the
road
and
obliterating
the
jest
with
a
handful
of
mud
picked
up
for
the
purpose
and
smeared
over
it
why
do
you
write
in
the
public
streets
is
there
tell
me
thou
is
there
no
other
place
to
write
such
words
in
in
his
expostulation
he
dropped
his
cleaner
hand
perhaps
accidentally
perhaps
not
upon
the
joker
s
heart
the
joker
rapped
it
with
his
own
took
a
nimble
spring
upward
and
came
down
in
a
fantastic
dancing
attitude
with
one
of
his
stained
shoes
jerked
off
his
foot
into
his
hand
and
held
out
a
joker
of
an
extremely
not
to
say
wolfishly
practical
character
he
looked
under
those
circumstances
put
it
on
put
it
on
said
the
other
call
wine
wine
and
finish
there
with
that
advice
he
wiped
his
soiled
hand
upon
the
joker
s
dress
such
as
it
was
quite
deliberately
as
having
dirtied
the
hand
on
his
account
and
then
recrossed
the
road
and
entered
the
wine
shop
this
wine
shop
keeper
was
a
bull
necked
martial
looking
man
of
thirty
and
he
should
have
been
of
a
hot
temperament
for
although
it
was
a
bitter
day
he
wore
no
coat
but
carried
one
slung
over
his
shoulder
his
shirt
sleeves
were
rolled
up
too
and
his
brown
arms
were
bare
to
the
elbows
neither
did
he
wear
anything
more
on
his
head
than
his
own
crisply
curling
short
dark
hair
he
was
a
dark
man
altogether
with
good
eyes
and
a
good
bold
breadth
between
them
good
humoured
looking
on
the
whole
but
implacable
looking
too
evidently
a
man
of
a
strong
resolution
and
a
set
purpose
a
man
not
desirable
to
be
met
rushing
down
a
narrow
pass
with
a
gulf
on
either
side
for
nothing
would
turn
the
man
madame
defarge
his
wife
sat
in
the
shop
behind
the
counter
as
he
came
in
madame
defarge
was
a
stout
woman
of
about
his
own
age
with
a
watchful
eye
that
seldom
seemed
to
look
at
anything
a
large
hand
heavily
ringed
a
steady
face
strong
features
and
great
composure
of
manner
there
was
a
character
about
madame
defarge
from
which
one
might
have
predicated
that
she
did
not
often
make
mistakes
against
herself
in
any
of
the
reckonings
over
which
she
presided
madame
defarge
being
sensitive
to
cold
was
wrapped
in
fur
and
had
a
quantity
of
bright
shawl
twined
about
her
head
though
not
to
the
concealment
of
her
large
earrings
her
knitting
was
before
her
but
she
had
laid
it
down
to
pick
her
teeth
with
a
toothpick
thus
engaged
with
her
right
elbow
supported
by
her
left
hand
madame
defarge
said
nothing
when
her
lord
came
in
but
coughed
just
one
grain
of
cough
this
in
combination
with
the
lifting
of
her
darkly
defined
eyebrows
over
her
toothpick
by
the
breadth
of
a
line
suggested
to
her
husband
that
he
would
do
well
to
look
round
the
shop
among
the
customers
for
any
new
customer
who
had
dropped
in
while
he
stepped
over
the
way
the
wine
shop
keeper
accordingly
rolled
his
eyes
about
until
they
rested
upon
an
elderly
gentleman
and
a
young
lady
who
were
seated
in
a
corner
other
company
were
there
two
playing
cards
two
playing
dominoes
three
standing
by
the
counter
lengthening
out
a
short
supply
of
wine
as
he
passed
behind
the
counter
he
took
notice
that
the
elderly
gentleman
said
in
a
look
to
the
young
lady
this
is
our
man
what
the
devil
do
you
do
in
that
galley
there
said
monsieur
defarge
to
himself
i
don
t
know
you
but
he
feigned
not
to
notice
the
two
strangers
and
fell
into
discourse
with
the
triumvirate
of
customers
who
were
drinking
at
the
counter
how
goes
it
jacques
said
one
of
these
three
to
monsieur
defarge
is
all
the
spilt
wine
swallowed
every
drop
jacques
answered
monsieur
defarge
when
this
interchange
of
christian
name
was
effected
madame
defarge
picking
her
teeth
with
her
toothpick
coughed
another
grain
of
cough
and
raised
her
eyebrows
by
the
breadth
of
another
line
it
is
not
often
said
the
second
of
the
three
addressing
monsieur
defarge
that
many
of
these
miserable
beasts
know
the
taste
of
wine
or
of
anything
but
black
bread
and
death
is
it
not
so
jacques
it
is
so
jacques
monsieur
defarge
returned
at
this
second
interchange
of
the
christian
name
madame
defarge
still
using
her
toothpick
with
profound
composure
coughed
another
grain
of
cough
and
raised
her
eyebrows
by
the
breadth
of
another
line
the
last
of
the
three
now
said
his
say
as
he
put
down
his
empty
drinking
vessel
and
smacked
his
lips
ah
so
much
the
worse
a
bitter
taste
it
is
that
such
poor
cattle
always
have
in
their
mouths
and
hard
lives
they
live
jacques
am
i
right
jacques
you
are
right
jacques
was
the
response
of
monsieur
defarge
this
third
interchange
of
the
christian
name
was
completed
at
the
moment
when
madame
defarge
put
her
toothpick
by
kept
her
eyebrows
up
and
slightly
rustled
in
her
seat
hold
then
true
muttered
her
husband
gentlemen
my
wife
the
three
customers
pulled
off
their
hats
to
madame
defarge
with
three
flourishes
she
acknowledged
their
homage
by
bending
her
head
and
giving
them
a
quick
look
then
she
glanced
in
a
casual
manner
round
the
wine
shop
took
up
her
knitting
with
great
apparent
calmness
and
repose
of
spirit
and
became
absorbed
in
it
gentlemen
said
her
husband
who
had
kept
his
bright
eye
observantly
upon
her
good
day
the
chamber
furnished
bachelor
fashion
that
you
wished
to
see
and
were
inquiring
for
when
i
stepped
out
is
on
the
fifth
floor
the
doorway
of
the
staircase
gives
on
the
little
courtyard
close
to
the
left
here
pointing
with
his
hand
near
to
the
window
of
my
establishment
but
now
that
i
remember
one
of
you
has
already
been
there
and
can
show
the
way
gentlemen
adieu
they
paid
for
their
wine
and
left
the
place
the
eyes
of
monsieur
defarge
were
studying
his
wife
at
her
knitting
when
the
elderly
gentleman
advanced
from
his
corner
and
begged
the
favour
of
a
word
willingly
sir
said
monsieur
defarge
and
quietly
stepped
with
him
to
the
door
their
conference
was
very
short
but
very
decided
almost
at
the
first
word
monsieur
defarge
started
and
became
deeply
attentive
it
had
not
lasted
a
minute
when
he
nodded
and
went
out
the
gentleman
then
beckoned
to
the
young
lady
and
they
too
went
out
madame
defarge
knitted
with
nimble
fingers
and
steady
eyebrows
and
saw
nothing
mr
jarvis
lorry
and
miss
manette
emerging
from
the
wine
shop
thus
joined
monsieur
defarge
in
the
doorway
to
which
he
had
directed
his
own
company
just
before
it
opened
from
a
stinking
little
black
courtyard
and
was
the
general
public
entrance
to
a
great
pile
of
houses
inhabited
by
a
great
number
of
people
in
the
gloomy
tile
paved
entry
to
the
gloomy
tile
paved
staircase
monsieur
defarge
bent
down
on
one
knee
to
the
child
of
his
old
master
and
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
it
was
a
gentle
action
but
not
at
all
gently
done
a
very
remarkable
transformation
had
come
over
him
in
a
few
seconds
he
had
no
good
humour
in
his
face
nor
any
openness
of
aspect
left
but
had
become
a
secret
angry
dangerous
man
it
is
very
high
it
is
a
little
difficult
better
to
begin
slowly
thus
monsieur
defarge
in
a
stern
voice
to
mr
lorry
as
they
began
ascending
the
stairs
is
he
alone
the
latter
whispered
alone
god
help
him
who
should
be
with
him
said
the
other
in
the
same
low
voice
is
he
always
alone
then
yes
of
his
own
desire
of
his
own
necessity
as
he
was
when
i
first
saw
him
after
they
found
me
and
demanded
to
know
if
i
would
take
him
and
at
my
peril
be
discreet
as
he
was
then
so
he
is
now
he
is
greatly
changed
changed
the
keeper
of
the
wine
shop
stopped
to
strike
the
wall
with
his
hand
and
mutter
a
tremendous
curse
no
direct
answer
could
have
been
half
so
forcible
mr
lorry
s
spirits
grew
heavier
and
heavier
as
he
and
his
two
companions
ascended
higher
and
higher
such
a
staircase
with
its
accessories
in
the
older
and
more
crowded
parts
of
paris
would
be
bad
enough
now
but
at
that
time
it
was
vile
indeed
to
unaccustomed
and
unhardened
senses
every
little
habitation
within
the
great
foul
nest
of
one
high
building
that
is
to
say
the
room
or
rooms
within
every
door
that
opened
on
the
general
staircase
left
its
own
heap
of
refuse
on
its
own
landing
besides
flinging
other
refuse
from
its
own
windows
the
uncontrollable
and
hopeless
mass
of
decomposition
so
engendered
would
have
polluted
the
air
even
if
poverty
and
deprivation
had
not
loaded
it
with
their
intangible
impurities
the
two
bad
sources
combined
made
it
almost
insupportable
through
such
an
atmosphere
by
a
steep
dark
shaft
of
dirt
and
poison
the
way
lay
yielding
to
his
own
disturbance
of
mind
and
to
his
young
companion
s
agitation
which
became
greater
every
instant
mr
jarvis
lorry
twice
stopped
to
rest
each
of
these
stoppages
was
made
at
a
doleful
grating
by
which
any
languishing
good
airs
that
were
left
uncorrupted
seemed
to
escape
and
all
spoilt
and
sickly
vapours
seemed
to
crawl
in
through
the
rusted
bars
tastes
rather
than
glimpses
were
caught
of
the
jumbled
neighbourhood
and
nothing
within
range
nearer
or
lower
than
the
summits
of
the
two
great
towers
of
notre
dame
had
any
promise
on
it
of
healthy
life
or
wholesome
aspirations
at
last
the
top
of
the
staircase
was
gained
and
they
stopped
for
the
third
time
there
was
yet
an
upper
staircase
of
a
steeper
inclination
and
of
contracted
dimensions
to
be
ascended
before
the
garret
story
was
reached
the
keeper
of
the
wine
shop
always
going
a
little
in
advance
and
always
going
on
the
side
which
mr
lorry
took
as
though
he
dreaded
to
be
asked
any
question
by
the
young
lady
turned
himself
about
here
and
carefully
feeling
in
the
pockets
of
the
coat
he
carried
over
his
shoulder
took
out
a
key
the
door
is
locked
then
my
friend
said
mr
lorry
surprised
ay
yes
was
the
grim
reply
of
monsieur
defarge
you
think
it
necessary
to
keep
the
unfortunate
gentleman
so
retired
i
think
it
necessary
to
turn
the
key
monsieur
defarge
whispered
it
closer
in
his
ear
and
frowned
heavily
why
why
because
he
has
lived
so
long
locked
up
that
he
would
be
frightened
rave
tear
himself
to
pieces
die
come
to
i
know
not
what
harm
if
his
door
was
left
open
is
it
possible
exclaimed
mr
lorry
is
it
possible
repeated
defarge
bitterly
yes
and
a
beautiful
world
we
live
in
when
it
is
possible
and
when
many
other
such
things
are
possible
and
not
only
possible
but
done
done
see
you
under
that
sky
there
every
day
long
live
the
devil
let
us
go
on
this
dialogue
had
been
held
in
so
very
low
a
whisper
that
not
a
word
of
it
had
reached
the
young
lady
s
ears
but
by
this
time
she
trembled
under
such
strong
emotion
and
her
face
expressed
such
deep
anxiety
and
above
all
such
dread
and
terror
that
mr
lorry
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
speak
a
word
or
two
of
reassurance
courage
dear
miss
courage
business
the
worst
will
be
over
in
a
moment
it
is
but
passing
the
room
door
and
the
worst
is
over
then
all
the
good
you
bring
to
him
all
the
relief
all
the
happiness
you
bring
to
him
begin
let
our
good
friend
here
assist
you
on
that
side
that
s
well
friend
defarge
come
now
business
business
they
went
up
slowly
and
softly
the
staircase
was
short
and
they
were
soon
at
the
top
there
as
it
had
an
abrupt
turn
in
it
they
came
all
at
once
in
sight
of
three
men
whose
heads
were
bent
down
close
together
at
the
side
of
a
door
and
who
were
intently
looking
into
the
room
to
which
the
door
belonged
through
some
chinks
or
holes
in
the
wall
on
hearing
footsteps
close
at
hand
these
three
turned
and
rose
and
showed
themselves
to
be
the
three
of
one
name
who
had
been
drinking
in
the
wine
shop
i
forgot
them
in
the
surprise
of
your
visit
explained
monsieur
defarge
leave
us
good
boys
we
have
business
here
the
three
glided
by
and
went
silently
down
there
appearing
to
be
no
other
door
on
that
floor
and
the
keeper
of
the
wine
shop
going
straight
to
this
one
when
they
were
left
alone
mr
lorry
asked
him
in
a
whisper
with
a
little
anger
do
you
make
a
show
of
monsieur
manette
i
show
him
in
the
way
you
have
seen
to
a
chosen
few
is
that
well
i
think
it
is
well
who
are
the
few
how
do
you
choose
them
i
choose
them
as
real
men
of
my
name
jacques
is
my
name
to
whom
the
sight
is
likely
to
do
good
enough
you
are
english
that
is
another
thing
stay
there
if
you
please
a
little
moment
with
an
admonitory
gesture
to
keep
them
back
he
stooped
and
looked
in
through
the
crevice
in
the
wall
soon
raising
his
head
again
he
struck
twice
or
thrice
upon
the
door
evidently
with
no
other
object
than
to
make
a
noise
there
with
the
same
intention
he
drew
the
key
across
it
three
or
four
times
before
he
put
it
clumsily
into
the
lock
and
turned
it
as
heavily
as
he
could
the
door
slowly
opened
inward
under
his
hand
and
he
looked
into
the
room
and
said
something
a
faint
voice
answered
something
little
more
than
a
single
syllable
could
have
been
spoken
on
either
side
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
beckoned
them
to
enter
mr
lorry
got
his
arm
securely
round
the
daughter
s
waist
and
held
her
for
he
felt
that
she
was
sinking
a
a
a
business
business
he
urged
with
a
moisture
that
was
not
of
business
shining
on
his
cheek
come
in
come
in
i
am
afraid
of
it
she
answered
shuddering
of
it
what
i
mean
of
him
of
my
father
rendered
in
a
manner
desperate
by
her
state
and
by
the
beckoning
of
their
conductor
he
drew
over
his
neck
the
arm
that
shook
upon
his
shoulder
lifted
her
a
little
and
hurried
her
into
the
room
he
sat
her
down
just
within
the
door
and
held
her
clinging
to
him
defarge
drew
out
the
key
closed
the
door
locked
it
on
the
inside
took
out
the
key
again
and
held
it
in
his
hand
all
this
he
did
methodically
and
with
as
loud
and
harsh
an
accompaniment
of
noise
as
he
could
make
finally
he
walked
across
the
room
with
a
measured
tread
to
where
the
window
was
he
stopped
there
and
faced
round
the
garret
built
to
be
a
depository
for
firewood
and
the
like
was
dim
and
dark
for
the
window
of
dormer
shape
was
in
truth
a
door
in
the
roof
with
a
little
crane
over
it
for
the
hoisting
up
of
stores
from
the
street
unglazed
and
closing
up
the
middle
in
two
pieces
like
any
other
door
of
french
construction
to
exclude
the
cold
one
half
of
this
door
was
fast
closed
and
the
other
was
opened
but
a
very
little
way
such
a
scanty
portion
of
light
was
admitted
through
these
means
that
it
was
difficult
on
first
coming
in
to
see
anything
and
long
habit
alone
could
have
slowly
formed
in
any
one
the
ability
to
do
any
work
requiring
nicety
in
such
obscurity
yet
work
of
that
kind
was
being
done
in
the
garret
for
with
his
back
towards
the
door
and
his
face
towards
the
window
where
the
keeper
of
the
wine
shop
stood
looking
at
him
a
white
haired
man
sat
on
a
low
bench
stooping
forward
and
very
busy
making
shoes
vi
the
shoemaker
good
day
said
monsieur
defarge
looking
down
at
the
white
head
that
bent
low
over
the
shoemaking
it
was
raised
for
a
moment
and
a
very
faint
voice
responded
to
the
salutation
as
if
it
were
at
a
distance
good
day
you
are
still
hard
at
work
i
see
after
a
long
silence
the
head
was
lifted
for
another
moment
and
the
voice
replied
yes
i
am
working
this
time
a
pair
of
haggard
eyes
had
looked
at
the
questioner
before
the
face
had
dropped
again
the
faintness
of
the
voice
was
pitiable
and
dreadful
it
was
not
the
faintness
of
physical
weakness
though
confinement
and
hard
fare
no
doubt
had
their
part
in
it
its
deplorable
peculiarity
was
that
it
was
the
faintness
of
solitude
and
disuse
it
was
like
the
last
feeble
echo
of
a
sound
made
long
and
long
ago
so
entirely
had
it
lost
the
life
and
resonance
of
the
human
voice
that
it
affected
the
senses
like
a
once
beautiful
colour
faded
away
into
a
poor
weak
stain
so
sunken
and
suppressed
it
was
that
it
was
like
a
voice
underground
so
expressive
it
was
of
a
hopeless
and
lost
creature
that
a
famished
traveller
wearied
out
by
lonely
wandering
in
a
wilderness
would
have
remembered
home
and
friends
in
such
a
tone
before
lying
down
to
die
some
minutes
of
silent
work
had
passed
and
the
haggard
eyes
had
looked
up
again
not
with
any
interest
or
curiosity
but
with
a
dull
mechanical
perception
beforehand
that
the
spot
where
the
only
visitor
they
were
aware
of
had
stood
was
not
yet
empty
i
want
said
defarge
who
had
not
removed
his
gaze
from
the
shoemaker
to
let
in
a
little
more
light
here
you
can
bear
a
little
more
the
shoemaker
stopped
his
work
looked
with
a
vacant
air
of
listening
at
the
floor
on
one
side
of
him
then
similarly
at
the
floor
on
the
other
side
of
him
then
upward
at
the
speaker
what
did
you
say
you
can
bear
a
little
more
light
i
must
bear
it
if
you
let
it
in
laying
the
palest
shadow
of
a
stress
upon
the
second
word
the
opened
half
door
was
opened
a
little
further
and
secured
at
that
angle
for
the
time
a
broad
ray
of
light
fell
into
the
garret
and
showed
the
workman
with
an
unfinished
shoe
upon
his
lap
pausing
in
his
labour
his
few
common
tools
and
various
scraps
of
leather
were
at
his
feet
and
on
his
bench
he
had
a
white
beard
raggedly
cut
but
not
very
long
a
hollow
face
and
exceedingly
bright
eyes
the
hollowness
and
thinness
of
his
face
would
have
caused
them
to
look
large
under
his
yet
dark
eyebrows
and
his
confused
white
hair
though
they
had
been
really
otherwise
but
they
were
naturally
large
and
looked
unnaturally
so
his
yellow
rags
of
shirt
lay
open
at
the
throat
and
showed
his
body
to
be
withered
and
worn
he
and
his
old
canvas
frock
and
his
loose
stockings
and
all
his
poor
tatters
of
clothes
had
in
a
long
seclusion
from
direct
light
and
air
faded
down
to
such
a
dull
uniformity
of
parchment
yellow
that
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
which
was
which
he
had
put
up
a
hand
between
his
eyes
and
the
light
and
the
very
bones
of
it
seemed
transparent
so
he
sat
with
a
steadfastly
vacant
gaze
pausing
in
his
work
he
never
looked
at
the
figure
before
him
without
first
looking
down
on
this
side
of
himself
then
on
that
as
if
he
had
lost
the
habit
of
associating
place
with
sound
he
never
spoke
without
first
wandering
in
this
manner
and
forgetting
to
speak
are
you
going
to
finish
that
pair
of
shoes
to
day
asked
defarge
motioning
to
mr
lorry
to
come
forward
what
did
you
say
do
you
mean
to
finish
that
pair
of
shoes
to
day
i
can
t
say
that
i
mean
to
i
suppose
so
i
don
t
know
but
the
question
reminded
him
of
his
work
and
he
bent
over
it
again
mr
lorry
came
silently
forward
leaving
the
daughter
by
the
door
when
he
had
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
by
the
side
of
defarge
the
shoemaker
looked
up
he
showed
no
surprise
at
seeing
another
figure
but
the
unsteady
fingers
of
one
of
his
hands
strayed
to
his
lips
as
he
looked
at
it
his
lips
and
his
nails
were
of
the
same
pale
lead
colour
and
then
the
hand
dropped
to
his
work
and
he
once
more
bent
over
the
shoe
the
look
and
the
action
had
occupied
but
an
instant
you
have
a
visitor
you
see
said
monsieur
defarge
what
did
you
say
here
is
a
visitor
the
shoemaker
looked
up
as
before
but
without
removing
a
hand
from
his
work
come
said
defarge
here
is
monsieur
who
knows
a
well
made
shoe
when
he
sees
one
show
him
that
shoe
you
are
working
at
take
it
monsieur
mr
lorry
took
it
in
his
hand
tell
monsieur
what
kind
of
shoe
it
is
and
the
maker
s
name
there
was
a
longer
pause
than
usual
before
the
shoemaker
replied
i
forget
what
it
was
you
asked
me
what
did
you
say
i
said
couldn
t
you
describe
the
kind
of
shoe
for
monsieur
s
information
it
is
a
lady
s
shoe
it
is
a
young
lady
s
walking
shoe
it
is
in
the
present
mode
i
never
saw
the
mode
i
have
had
a
pattern
in
my
hand
he
glanced
at
the
shoe
with
some
little
passing
touch
of
pride
and
the
maker
s
name
said
defarge
now
that
he
had
no
work
to
hold
he
laid
the
knuckles
of
the
right
hand
in
the
hollow
of
the
left
and
then
the
knuckles
of
the
left
hand
in
the
hollow
of
the
right
and
then
passed
a
hand
across
his
bearded
chin
and
so
on
in
regular
changes
without
a
moment
s
intermission
the
task
of
recalling
him
from
the
vagrancy
into
which
he
always
sank
when
he
had
spoken
was
like
recalling
some
very
weak
person
from
a
swoon
or
endeavouring
in
the
hope
of
some
disclosure
to
stay
the
spirit
of
a
fast
dying
man
did
you
ask
me
for
my
name
assuredly
i
did
one
hundred
and
five
north
tower
is
that
all
one
hundred
and
five
north
tower
with
a
weary
sound
that
was
not
a
sigh
nor
a
groan
he
bent
to
work
again
until
the
silence
was
again
broken
you
are
not
a
shoemaker
by
trade
said
mr
lorry
looking
steadfastly
at
him
his
haggard
eyes
turned
to
defarge
as
if
he
would
have
transferred
the
question
to
him
but
as
no
help
came
from
that
quarter
they
turned
back
on
the
questioner
when
they
had
sought
the
ground
i
am
not
a
shoemaker
by
trade
no
i
was
not
a
shoemaker
by
trade
i
i
learnt
it
here
i
taught
myself
i
asked
leave
to
he
lapsed
away
even
for
minutes
ringing
those
measured
changes
on
his
hands
the
whole
time
his
eyes
came
slowly
back
at
last
to
the
face
from
which
they
had
wandered
when
they
rested
on
it
he
started
and
resumed
in
the
manner
of
a
sleeper
that
moment
awake
reverting
to
a
subject
of
last
night
i
asked
leave
to
teach
myself
and
i
got
it
with
much
difficulty
after
a
long
while
and
i
have
made
shoes
ever
since
as
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
shoe
that
had
been
taken
from
him
mr
lorry
said
still
looking
steadfastly
in
his
face
monsieur
manette
do
you
remember
nothing
of
me
the
shoe
dropped
to
the
ground
and
he
sat
looking
fixedly
at
the
questioner
monsieur
manette
mr
lorry
laid
his
hand
upon
defarge
s
arm
do
you
remember
nothing
of
this
man
look
at
him
look
at
me
is
there
no
old
banker
no
old
business
no
old
servant
no
old
time
rising
in
your
mind
monsieur
manette
as
the
captive
of
many
years
sat
looking
fixedly
by
turns
at
mr
lorry
and
at
defarge
some
long
obliterated
marks
of
an
actively
intent
intelligence
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
gradually
forced
themselves
through
the
black
mist
that
had
fallen
on
him
they
were
overclouded
again
they
were
fainter
they
were
gone
but
they
had
been
there
and
so
exactly
was
the
expression
repeated
on
the
fair
young
face
of
her
who
had
crept
along
the
wall
to
a
point
where
she
could
see
him
and
where
she
now
stood
looking
at
him
with
hands
which
at
first
had
been
only
raised
in
frightened
compassion
if
not
even
to
keep
him
off
and
shut
out
the
sight
of
him
but
which
were
now
extending
towards
him
trembling
with
eagerness
to
lay
the
spectral
face
upon
her
warm
young
breast
and
love
it
back
to
life
and
hope
so
exactly
was
the
expression
repeated
though
in
stronger
characters
on
her
fair
young
face
that
it
looked
as
though
it
had
passed
like
a
moving
light
from
him
to
her
darkness
had
fallen
on
him
in
its
place
he
looked
at
the
two
less
and
less
attentively
and
his
eyes
in
gloomy
abstraction
sought
the
ground
and
looked
about
him
in
the
old
way
finally
with
a
deep
long
sigh
he
took
the
shoe
up
and
resumed
his
work
have
you
recognised
him
monsieur
asked
defarge
in
a
whisper
yes
for
a
moment
at
first
i
thought
it
quite
hopeless
but
i
have
unquestionably
seen
for
a
single
moment
the
face
that
i
once
knew
so
well
hush
let
us
draw
further
back
hush
she
had
moved
from
the
wall
of
the
garret
very
near
to
the
bench
on
which
he
sat
there
was
something
awful
in
his
unconsciousness
of
the
figure
that
could
have
put
out
its
hand
and
touched
him
as
he
stooped
over
his
labour
not
a
word
was
spoken
not
a
sound
was
made
she
stood
like
a
spirit
beside
him
and
he
bent
over
his
work
it
happened
at
length
that
he
had
occasion
to
change
the
instrument
in
his
hand
for
his
shoemaker
s
knife
it
lay
on
that
side
of
him
which
was
not
the
side
on
which
she
stood
he
had
taken
it
up
and
was
stooping
to
work
again
when
his
eyes
caught
the
skirt
of
her
dress
he
raised
them
and
saw
her
face
the
two
spectators
started
forward
but
she
stayed
them
with
a
motion
of
her
hand
she
had
no
fear
of
his
striking
at
her
with
the
knife
though
they
had
he
stared
at
her
with
a
fearful
look
and
after
a
while
his
lips
began
to
form
some
words
though
no
sound
proceeded
from
them
by
degrees
in
the
pauses
of
his
quick
and
laboured
breathing
he
was
heard
to
say
what
is
this
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
face
she
put
her
two
hands
to
her
lips
and
kissed
them
to
him
then
clasped
them
on
her
breast
as
if
she
laid
his
ruined
head
there
you
are
not
the
gaoler
s
daughter
she
sighed
no
who
are
you
not
yet
trusting
the
tones
of
her
voice
she
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
him
he
recoiled
but
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
a
strange
thrill
struck
him
when
she
did
so
and
visibly
passed
over
his
frame
he
laid
the
knife
down
softly
as
he
sat
staring
at
her
her
golden
hair
which
she
wore
in
long
curls
had
been
hurriedly
pushed
aside
and
fell
down
over
her
neck
advancing
his
hand
by
little
and
little
he
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
in
the
midst
of
the
action
he
went
astray
and
with
another
deep
sigh
fell
to
work
at
his
shoemaking
but
not
for
long
releasing
his
arm
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
after
looking
doubtfully
at
it
two
or
three
times
as
if
to
be
sure
that
it
was
really
there
he
laid
down
his
work
put
his
hand
to
his
neck
and
took
off
a
blackened
string
with
a
scrap
of
folded
rag
attached
to
it
he
opened
this
carefully
on
his
knee
and
it
contained
a
very
little
quantity
of
hair
not
more
than
one
or
two
long
golden
hairs
which
he
had
in
some
old
day
wound
off
upon
his
finger
he
took
her
hair
into
his
hand
again
and
looked
closely
at
it
it
is
the
same
how
can
it
be
when
was
it
how
was
it
as
the
concentrated
expression
returned
to
his
forehead
he
seemed
to
become
conscious
that
it
was
in
hers
too
he
turned
her
full
to
the
light
and
looked
at
her
she
had
laid
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
that
night
when
i
was
summoned
out
she
had
a
fear
of
my
going
though
i
had
none
and
when
i
was
brought
to
the
north
tower
they
found
these
upon
my
sleeve
you
will
leave
me
them
they
can
never
help
me
to
escape
in
the
body
though
they
may
in
the
spirit
those
were
the
words
i
said
i
remember
them
very
well
he
formed
this
speech
with
his
lips
many
times
before
he
could
utter
it
but
when
he
did
find
spoken
words
for
it
they
came
to
him
coherently
though
slowly
how
was
this
was
it
you
once
more
the
two
spectators
started
as
he
turned
upon
her
with
a
frightful
suddenness
but
she
sat
perfectly
still
in
his
grasp
and
only
said
in
a
low
voice
i
entreat
you
good
gentlemen
do
not
come
near
us
do
not
speak
do
not
move
hark
he
exclaimed
whose
voice
was
that
his
hands
released
her
as
he
uttered
this
cry
and
went
up
to
his
white
hair
which
they
tore
in
a
frenzy
it
died
out
as
everything
but
his
shoemaking
did
die
out
of
him
and
he
refolded
his
little
packet
and
tried
to
secure
it
in
his
breast
but
he
still
looked
at
her
and
gloomily
shook
his
head
no

no
you
are
too
young
too
blooming
it
can
t
be

what
the
prisoner
is
these
are
not
the
hands
she
knew
this
is
not
the
face
she
knew
this
is
not
a
voice
she
ever
heard
no
no
she
was
and
he
was
before
the
slow
years
of
the
north
tower
ages
ago
what
is
your
name
my
gentle
angel
hailing
his
softened
tone
and
manner
his
daughter
fell
upon
her
knees
before
him
with
her
appealing
hands
upon
his
breast
o
sir
at
another
time
you
shall
know
my
name
and
who
my
mother
was
and
who
my
father
and
how
i
never
knew
their
hard
hard
history
but
i
cannot
tell
you
at
this
time
and
i
cannot
tell
you
here
all
that
i
may
tell
you
here
and
now
is
that
i
pray
to
you
to
touch
me
and
to
bless
me

me
o
my
dear
my
dear
his
cold
white
head
mingled
with
her
radiant
hair
which
warmed
and
lighted
it
as
though
it
were
the
light
of
freedom
shining
on
him
if
you
hear
in
my
voice
i
don
t
know
that
it
is
so
but
i
hope
it
is
if
you
hear
in
my
voice
any
resemblance
to
a
voice
that
once
was
sweet
music
in
your
ears
weep
for
it
weep
for
it
if
you
touch
in
touching
my
hair
anything
that
recalls
a
beloved
head
that
lay
on
your
breast
when
you
were
young
and
free
weep
for
it
weep
for
it
if
when
i
hint
to
you
of
a
home
that
is
before
us
where
i
will
be
true
to
you
with
all
my
duty
and
with
all
my
faithful
service
i
bring
back
the
remembrance
of
a
home
long
desolate
while
your
poor
heart
pined
away
weep
for
it
weep
for
it
she
held
him
closer
round
the
neck
and
rocked
him
on
her
breast
like
a
child
if
when
i
tell
you
dearest
dear
that
your
agony
is
over
and
that
i
have
come
here
to
take
you
from
it
and
that
we
go
to
england
to
be
at
peace
and
at
rest
i
cause
you
to
think
of
your
useful
life
laid
waste
and
of
our
native
france
so
wicked
to
you
weep
for
it
weep
for
it
and
if
when
i
shall
tell
you
of
my
name
and
of
my
father
who
is
living
and
of
my
mother
who
is
dead
you
learn
that
i
have
to
kneel
to
my
honoured
father
and
implore
his
pardon
for
having
never
for
his
sake
striven
all
day
and
lain
awake
and
wept
all
night
because
the
love
of
my
poor
mother
hid
his
torture
from
me
weep
for
it
weep
for
it
weep
for
her
then
and
for
me
good
gentlemen
thank
god
i
feel
his
sacred
tears
upon
my
face
and
his
sobs
strike
against
my
heart
o
see
thank
god
for
us
thank
god
he
had
sunk
in
her
arms
and
his
face
dropped
on
her
breast
a
sight
so
touching
yet
so
terrible
in
the
tremendous
wrong
and
suffering
which
had
gone
before
it
that
the
two
beholders
covered
their
faces
when
the
quiet
of
the
garret
had
been
long
undisturbed
and
his
heaving
breast
and
shaken
form
had
long
yielded
to
the
calm
that
must
follow
all
storms
emblem
to
humanity
of
the
rest
and
silence
into
which
the
storm
called
life
must
hush
at
last
they
came
forward
to
raise
the
father
and
daughter
from
the
ground
he
had
gradually
dropped
to
the
floor
and
lay
there
in
a
lethargy
worn
out
she
had
nestled
down
with
him
that
his
head
might
lie
upon
her
arm
and
her
hair
drooping
over
him
curtained
him
from
the
light
if
without
disturbing
him
she
said
raising
her
hand
to
mr
lorry
as
he
stooped
over
them
after
repeated
blowings
of
his
nose
all
could
be
arranged
for
our
leaving
paris
at
once
so
that
from
the
very
door
he
could
be
taken
away
but
consider
is
he
fit
for
the
journey
asked
mr
lorry
more
fit
for
that
i
think
than
to
remain
in
this
city
so
dreadful
to
him
it
is
true
said
defarge
who
was
kneeling
to
look
on
and
hear
more
than
that
monsieur
manette
is
for
all
reasons
best
out
of
france
say
shall
i
hire
a
carriage
and
post
horses
that
s
business
said
mr
lorry
resuming
on
the
shortest
notice
his
methodical
manners
and
if
business
is
to
be
done
i
had
better
do
it
then
be
so
kind
urged
miss
manette
as
to
leave
us
here
you
see
how
composed
he
has
become
and
you
cannot
be
afraid
to
leave
him
with
me
now
why
should
you
be
if
you
will
lock
the
door
to
secure
us
from
interruption
i
do
not
doubt
that
you
will
find
him
when
you
come
back
as
quiet
as
you
leave
him
in
any
case
i
will
take
care
of
him
until
you
return
and
then
we
will
remove
him
straight
both
mr
lorry
and
defarge
were
rather
disinclined
to
this
course
and
in
favour
of
one
of
them
remaining
but
as
there
were
not
only
carriage
and
horses
to
be
seen
to
but
travelling
papers
and
as
time
pressed
for
the
day
was
drawing
to
an
end
it
came
at
last
to
their
hastily
dividing
the
business
that
was
necessary
to
be
done
and
hurrying
away
to
do
it
then
as
the
darkness
closed
in
the
daughter
laid
her
head
down
on
the
hard
ground
close
at
the
father
s
side
and
watched
him
the
darkness
deepened
and
deepened
and
they
both
lay
quiet
until
a
light
gleamed
through
the
chinks
in
the
wall
mr
lorry
and
monsieur
defarge
had
made
all
ready
for
the
journey
and
had
brought
with
them
besides
travelling
cloaks
and
wrappers
bread
and
meat
wine
and
hot
coffee
monsieur
defarge
put
this
provender
and
the
lamp
he
carried
on
the
shoemaker
s
bench
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
garret
but
a
pallet
bed
and
he
and
mr
lorry
roused
the
captive
and
assisted
him
to
his
feet
no
human
intelligence
could
have
read
the
mysteries
of
his
mind
in
the
scared
blank
wonder
of
his
face
whether
he
knew
what
had
happened
whether
he
recollected
what
they
had
said
to
him
whether
he
knew
that
he
was
free
were
questions
which
no
sagacity
could
have
solved
they
tried
speaking
to
him
but
he
was
so
confused
and
so
very
slow
to
answer
that
they
took
fright
at
his
bewilderment
and
agreed
for
the
time
to
tamper
with
him
no
more
he
had
a
wild
lost
manner
of
occasionally
clasping
his
head
in
his
hands
that
had
not
been
seen
in
him
before
yet
he
had
some
pleasure
in
the
mere
sound
of
his
daughter
s
voice
and
invariably
turned
to
it
when
she
spoke
in
the
submissive
way
of
one
long
accustomed
to
obey
under
coercion
he
ate
and
drank
what
they
gave
him
to
eat
and
drink
and
put
on
the
cloak
and
other
wrappings
that
they
gave
him
to
wear
he
readily
responded
to
his
daughter
s
drawing
her
arm
through
his
and
took
and
kept
her
hand
in
both
his
own
they
began
to
descend
monsieur
defarge
going
first
with
the
lamp
mr
lorry
closing
the
little
procession
they
had
not
traversed
many
steps
of
the
long
main
staircase
when
he
stopped
and
stared
at
the
roof
and
round
at
the
walls
you
remember
the
place
my
father
you
remember
coming
up
here
what
did
you
say
but
before
she
could
repeat
the
question
he
murmured
an
answer
as
if
she
had
repeated
it
remember
no
i
don
t
remember
it
was
so
very
long
ago
that
he
had
no
recollection
whatever
of
his
having
been
brought
from
his
prison
to
that
house
was
apparent
to
them
they
heard
him
mutter
one
hundred
and
five
north
tower
and
when
he
looked
about
him
it
evidently
was
for
the
strong
fortress
walls
which
had
long
encompassed
him
on
their
reaching
the
courtyard
he
instinctively
altered
his
tread
as
being
in
expectation
of
a
drawbridge
and
when
there
was
no
drawbridge
and
he
saw
the
carriage
waiting
in
the
open
street
he
dropped
his
daughter
s
hand
and
clasped
his
head
again
no
crowd
was
about
the
door
no
people
were
discernible
at
any
of
the
many
windows
not
even
a
chance
passerby
was
in
the
street
an
unnatural
silence
and
desertion
reigned
there
only
one
soul
was
to
be
seen
and
that
was
madame
defarge
who
leaned
against
the
door
post
knitting
and
saw
nothing
the
prisoner
had
got
into
a
coach
and
his
daughter
had
followed
him
when
mr
lorry
s
feet
were
arrested
on
the
step
by
his
asking
miserably
for
his
shoemaking
tools
and
the
unfinished
shoes
madame
defarge
immediately
called
to
her
husband
that
she
would
get
them
and
went
knitting
out
of
the
lamplight
through
the
courtyard
she
quickly
brought
them
down
and
handed
them
in
and
immediately
afterwards
leaned
against
the
door
post
knitting
and
saw
nothing
defarge
got
upon
the
box
and
gave
the
word
to
the
barrier
the
postilion
cracked
his
whip
and
they
clattered
away
under
the
feeble
over
swinging
lamps
under
the
over
swinging
lamps
swinging
ever
brighter
in
the
better
streets
and
ever
dimmer
in
the
worse
and
by
lighted
shops
gay
crowds
illuminated
coffee
houses
and
theatre
doors
to
one
of
the
city
gates
soldiers
with
lanterns
at
the
guard
house
there
your
papers
travellers
see
here
then
monsieur
the
officer
said
defarge
getting
down
and
taking
him
gravely
apart
these
are
the
papers
of
monsieur
inside
with
the
white
head
they
were
consigned
to
me
with
him
at
the
he
dropped
his
voice
there
was
a
flutter
among
the
military
lanterns
and
one
of
them
being
handed
into
the
coach
by
an
arm
in
uniform
the
eyes
connected
with
the
arm
looked
not
an
every
day
or
an
every
night
look
at
monsieur
with
the
white
head
it
is
well
forward
from
the
uniform
adieu
from
defarge
and
so
under
a
short
grove
of
feebler
and
feebler
over
swinging
lamps
out
under
the
great
grove
of
stars
beneath
that
arch
of
unmoved
and
eternal
lights
some
so
remote
from
this
little
earth
that
the
learned
tell
us
it
is
doubtful
whether
their
rays
have
even
yet
discovered
it
as
a
point
in
space
where
anything
is
suffered
or
done
the
shadows
of
the
night
were
broad
and
black
all
through
the
cold
and
restless
interval
until
dawn
they
once
more
whispered
in
the
ears
of
mr
jarvis
lorry
sitting
opposite
the
buried
man
who
had
been
dug
out
and
wondering
what
subtle
powers
were
for
ever
lost
to
him
and
what
were
capable
of
restoration
the
old
inquiry
i
hope
you
care
to
be
recalled
to
life
and
the
old
answer
i
can
t
say
the
end
of
the
first
book
book
the
second
the
golden
thread
i
five
years
later
tellson
s
bank
by
temple
bar
was
an
old
fashioned
place
even
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
it
was
very
small
very
dark
very
ugly
very
incommodious
it
was
an
old
fashioned
place
moreover
in
the
moral
attribute
that
the
partners
in
the
house
were
proud
of
its
smallness
proud
of
its
darkness
proud
of
its
ugliness
proud
of
its
incommodiousness
they
were
even
boastful
of
its
eminence
in
those
particulars
and
were
fired
by
an
express
conviction
that
if
it
were
less
objectionable
it
would
be
less
respectable
this
was
no
passive
belief
but
an
active
weapon
which
they
flashed
at
more
convenient
places
of
business
tellson
s
they
said
wanted
no
elbow
room
tellson
s
wanted
no
light
tellson
s
wanted
no
embellishment
noakes
and
co
s
might
or
snooks
brothers
might
but
tellson
s
thank
heaven
any
one
of
these
partners
would
have
disinherited
his
son
on
the
question
of
rebuilding
tellson
s
in
this
respect
the
house
was
much
on
a
par
with
the
country
which
did
very
often
disinherit
its
sons
for
suggesting
improvements
in
laws
and
customs
that
had
long
been
highly
objectionable
but
were
only
the
more
respectable
thus
it
had
come
to
pass
that
tellson
s
was
the
triumphant
perfection
of
inconvenience
after
bursting
open
a
door
of
idiotic
obstinacy
with
a
weak
rattle
in
its
throat
you
fell
into
tellson
s
down
two
steps
and
came
to
your
senses
in
a
miserable
little
shop
with
two
little
counters
where
the
oldest
of
men
made
your
cheque
shake
as
if
the
wind
rustled
it
while
they
examined
the
signature
by
the
dingiest
of
windows
which
were
always
under
a
shower
bath
of
mud
from
fleet
street
and
which
were
made
the
dingier
by
their
own
iron
bars
proper
and
the
heavy
shadow
of
temple
bar
if
your
business
necessitated
your
seeing
the
house
you
were
put
into
a
species
of
condemned
hold
at
the
back
where
you
meditated
on
a
misspent
life
until
the
house
came
with
its
hands
in
its
pockets
and
you
could
hardly
blink
at
it
in
the
dismal
twilight
your
money
came
out
of
or
went
into
wormy
old
wooden
drawers
particles
of
which
flew
up
your
nose
and
down
your
throat
when
they
were
opened
and
shut
your
bank
notes
had
a
musty
odour
as
if
they
were
fast
decomposing
into
rags
again
your
plate
was
stowed
away
among
the
neighbouring
cesspools
and
evil
communications
corrupted
its
good
polish
in
a
day
or
two
your
deeds
got
into
extemporised
strong
rooms
made
of
kitchens
and
sculleries
and
fretted
all
the
fat
out
of
their
parchments
into
the
banking
house
air
your
lighter
boxes
of
family
papers
went
up
stairs
into
a
barmecide
room
that
always
had
a
great
dining
table
in
it
and
never
had
a
dinner
and
where
even
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
the
first
letters
written
to
you
by
your
old
love
or
by
your
little
children
were
but
newly
released
from
the
horror
of
being
ogled
through
the
windows
by
the
heads
exposed
on
temple
bar
with
an
insensate
brutality
and
ferocity
worthy
of
abyssinia
or
ashantee
but
indeed
at
that
time
putting
to
death
was
a
recipe
much
in
vogue
with
all
trades
and
professions
and
not
least
of
all
with
tellson
s
death
is
nature
s
remedy
for
all
things
and
why
not
legislation
s
accordingly
the
forger
was
put
to
death
the
utterer
of
a
bad
note
was
put
to
death
the
unlawful
opener
of
a
letter
was
put
to
death
the
purloiner
of
forty
shillings
and
sixpence
was
put
to
death
the
holder
of
a
horse
at
tellson
s
door
who
made
off
with
it
was
put
to
death
the
coiner
of
a
bad
shilling
was
put
to
death
the
sounders
of
three
fourths
of
the
notes
in
the
whole
gamut
of
crime
were
put
to
death
not
that
it
did
the
least
good
in
the
way
of
prevention
it
might
almost
have
been
worth
remarking
that
the
fact
was
exactly
the
reverse
but
it
cleared
off
as
to
this
world
the
trouble
of
each
particular
case
and
left
nothing
else
connected
with
it
to
be
looked
after
thus
tellson
s
in
its
day
like
greater
places
of
business
its
contemporaries
had
taken
so
many
lives
that
if
the
heads
laid
low
before
it
had
been
ranged
on
temple
bar
instead
of
being
privately
disposed
of
they
would
probably
have
excluded
what
little
light
the
ground
floor
had
in
a
rather
significant
manner
cramped
in
all
kinds
of
dim
cupboards
and
hutches
at
tellson
s
the
oldest
of
men
carried
on
the
business
gravely
when
they
took
a
young
man
into
tellson
s
london
house
they
hid
him
somewhere
till
he
was
old
they
kept
him
in
a
dark
place
like
a
cheese
until
he
had
the
full
tellson
flavour
and
blue
mould
upon
him
then
only
was
he
permitted
to
be
seen
spectacularly
poring
over
large
books
and
casting
his
breeches
and
gaiters
into
the
general
weight
of
the
establishment
outside

s
never
by
any
means
in
it
unless
called
in
was
an
odd
job
man
an
occasional
porter
and
messenger
who
served
as
the
live
sign
of
the
house
he
was
never
absent
during
business
hours
unless
upon
an
errand
and
then
he
was
represented
by
his
son
a
grisly
urchin
of
twelve
who
was
his
express
image
people
understood
that
tellson
s
in
a
stately
way
tolerated
the
odd
job
man
the
house
had
always
tolerated
some
person
in
that
capacity
and
time
and
tide
had
drifted
this
person
to
the
post
his
surname
was
cruncher
and
on
the
youthful
occasion
of
his
renouncing
by
proxy
the
works
of
darkness
in
the
easterly
parish
church
of
hounsditch
he
had
received
the
added
appellation
of
jerry
the
scene
was
mr
cruncher
s
private
lodging
in
hanging
sword
alley
whitefriars
the
time
half
past
seven
of
the
clock
on
a
windy
march
morning
anno
domini
seventeen
hundred
and
eighty
mr
cruncher
himself
always
spoke
of
the
year
of
our
lord
as
anna
dominoes
apparently
under
the
impression
that
the
christian
era
dated
from
the
invention
of
a
popular
game
by
a
lady
who
had
bestowed
her
name
upon
it
mr
cruncher
s
apartments
were
not
in
a
savoury
neighbourhood
and
were
but
two
in
number
even
if
a
closet
with
a
single
pane
of
glass
in
it
might
be
counted
as
one
but
they
were
very
decently
kept
early
as
it
was
on
the
windy
march
morning
the
room
in
which
he
lay
abed
was
already
scrubbed
throughout
and
between
the
cups
and
saucers
arranged
for
breakfast
and
the
lumbering
deal
table
a
very
clean
white
cloth
was
spread
mr
cruncher
reposed
under
a
patchwork
counterpane
like
a
harlequin
at
home
at
first
he
slept
heavily
but
by
degrees
began
to
roll
and
surge
in
bed
until
he
rose
above
the
surface
with
his
spiky
hair
looking
as
if
it
must
tear
the
sheets
to
ribbons
at
which
juncture
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
dire
exasperation
bust
me
if
she
ain
t
at
it
agin
a
woman
of
orderly
and
industrious
appearance
rose
from
her
knees
in
a
corner
with
sufficient
haste
and
trepidation
to
show
that
she
was
the
person
referred
to
what
said
mr
cruncher
looking
out
of
bed
for
a
boot
you
re
at
it
agin
are
you
after
hailing
the
morn
with
this
second
salutation
he
threw
a
boot
at
the
woman
as
a
third
it
was
a
very
muddy
boot
and
may
introduce
the
odd
circumstance
connected
with
mr
cruncher
s
domestic
economy
that
whereas
he
often
came
home
after
banking
hours
with
clean
boots
he
often
got
up
next
morning
to
find
the
same
boots
covered
with
clay
what
said
mr
cruncher
varying
his
apostrophe
after
missing
his
mark
what
are
you
up
to
aggerawayter
i
was
only
saying
my
prayers
saying
your
prayers
you
re
a
nice
woman
what
do
you
mean
by
flopping
yourself
down
and
praying
agin
me
i
was
not
praying
against
you
i
was
praying
for
you
you
weren
t
and
if

your

young
jerry

dutiful
mother
you

my
son
you

got
a
religious
mother
you

my
boy
going
and
flopping
herself
down
and
praying
that
the
bread
and
butter
may
be
snatched
out
of
the
mouth
of
her
only
child
master
cruncher
who
was
in
his
shirt
took
this
very
ill
and
turning
to
his
mother
strongly
deprecated
any
praying
away
of
his
personal
board
and
what
do
you
suppose
you
conceited
female
said
mr
cruncher
with
unconscious
inconsistency
that
the
worth
of
your
prayers
may
be
name
the
price
that
you
put
your
prayers
at
they
only
come
from
the
heart
jerry
they
are
worth
no
more
than
that
worth
no
more
than
that
repeated
mr
cruncher
they
ain
t
worth
much
then
whether
or
no
i
won
t
be
prayed
agin
i
tell
you
i
can

it
i
m
not

made
unlucky
by
your
sneaking
if

must
go
flopping
yourself
down

in
favour
of
your
husband
and
child
and
not
in
opposition
to
em
if
i
had
had
any
but
a
unnat
ral
wife
and
this
poor
boy
had
had
any
but
a
unnat
ral
mother
i
might
have
made
some
money
last
week
instead
of

counter
prayed
and
countermined
and
religiously
circumwented
into
the
worst
of
luck
b
u
u
ust
me
said
mr
cruncher
who
all
this
time
had
been
putting
on
his
clothes
if
i
ain
t
what
with
piety
and
one
blowed
thing
and
another
been
choused
this
last
week
into
as
bad
luck
as
ever
a
poor
devil
of
a
honest
tradesman
met
with
young
jerry
dress
yourself
my
boy
and
while
i
clean
my
boots
keep
a
eye
upon
your
mother
now
and
then
and
if
you
see
any
signs
of
more
flopping
give
me
a
call
for
i
tell
you
here
he
addressed
his
wife
once
more
i
won
t
be
gone
agin
in
this
manner
i
am
as
rickety
as
a
hackney
coach
i
m
as
sleepy
as
laudanum
my
lines
is
strained
to
that
degree
that
i
shouldn
t
know
if
it
wasn
t
for
the
pain
in
em
which
was
me
and
which
somebody
else
yet
i
m
none
the
better
for
it
in
pocket
and
it
s
my
suspicion
that
you
ve
been
at
it
from
morning
to
night
to
prevent
me
from
being
the
better
for
it
in
pocket
and
i
won
t
put
up
with
it
aggerawayter
and
what
do
you
say
now
growling
in
addition
such
phrases
as
ah
yes
you
re
religious
too
you
wouldn
t
put
yourself
in
opposition
to
the
interests
of
your
husband
and
child
would
you
not
you
and
throwing
off
other
sarcastic
sparks
from
the
whirling
grindstone
of
his
indignation
mr
cruncher
betook
himself
to
his
boot
cleaning
and
his
general
preparation
for
business
in
the
meantime
his
son
whose
head
was
garnished
with
tenderer
spikes
and
whose
young
eyes
stood
close
by
one
another
as
his
father
s
did
kept
the
required
watch
upon
his
mother
he
greatly
disturbed
that
poor
woman
at
intervals
by
darting
out
of
his
sleeping
closet
where
he
made
his
toilet
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
you
are
going
to
flop
mother
halloa
father
and
after
raising
this
fictitious
alarm
darting
in
again
with
an
undutiful
grin
mr
cruncher
s
temper
was
not
at
all
improved
when
he
came
to
his
breakfast
he
resented
mrs
cruncher
s
saying
grace
with
particular
animosity
now
aggerawayter
what
are
you
up
to
at
it
again
his
wife
explained
that
she
had
merely
asked
a
blessing
don
t
do
it
said
mr
crunches
looking
about
as
if
he
rather
expected
to
see
the
loaf
disappear
under
the
efficacy
of
his
wife
s
petitions
i
ain
t
a
going
to
be
blest
out
of
house
and
home
i
won
t
have
my
wittles
blest
off
my
table
keep
still
exceedingly
red
eyed
and
grim
as
if
he
had
been
up
all
night
at
a
party
which
had
taken
anything
but
a
convivial
turn
jerry
cruncher
worried
his
breakfast
rather
than
ate
it
growling
over
it
like
any
four
footed
inmate
of
a
menagerie
towards
nine
o
clock
he
smoothed
his
ruffled
aspect
and
presenting
as
respectable
and
business
like
an
exterior
as
he
could
overlay
his
natural
self
with
issued
forth
to
the
occupation
of
the
day
it
could
scarcely
be
called
a
trade
in
spite
of
his
favourite
description
of
himself
as
a
honest
tradesman
his
stock
consisted
of
a
wooden
stool
made
out
of
a
broken
backed
chair
cut
down
which
stool
young
jerry
walking
at
his
father
s
side
carried
every
morning
to
beneath
the
banking
house
window
that
was
nearest
temple
bar
where
with
the
addition
of
the
first
handful
of
straw
that
could
be
gleaned
from
any
passing
vehicle
to
keep
the
cold
and
wet
from
the
odd
job
man
s
feet
it
formed
the
encampment
for
the
day
on
this
post
of
his
mr
cruncher
was
as
well
known
to
fleet
street
and
the
temple
as
the
bar
itself
and
was
almost
as
in
looking
encamped
at
a
quarter
before
nine
in
good
time
to
touch
his
three
cornered
hat
to
the
oldest
of
men
as
they
passed
in
to
tellson
s
jerry
took
up
his
station
on
this
windy
march
morning
with
young
jerry
standing
by
him
when
not
engaged
in
making
forays
through
the
bar
to
inflict
bodily
and
mental
injuries
of
an
acute
description
on
passing
boys
who
were
small
enough
for
his
amiable
purpose
father
and
son
extremely
like
each
other
looking
silently
on
at
the
morning
traffic
in
fleet
street
with
their
two
heads
as
near
to
one
another
as
the
two
eyes
of
each
were
bore
a
considerable
resemblance
to
a
pair
of
monkeys
the
resemblance
was
not
lessened
by
the
accidental
circumstance
that
the
mature
jerry
bit
and
spat
out
straw
while
the
twinkling
eyes
of
the
youthful
jerry
were
as
restlessly
watchful
of
him
as
of
everything
else
in
fleet
street
the
head
of
one
of
the
regular
indoor
messengers
attached
to
tellson
s
establishment
was
put
through
the
door
and
the
word
was
given
porter
wanted
hooray
father
here
s
an
early
job
to
begin
with
having
thus
given
his
parent
god
speed
young
jerry
seated
himself
on
the
stool
entered
on
his
reversionary
interest
in
the
straw
his
father
had
been
chewing
and
cogitated
al
ways
rusty
his
fingers
is
al
ways
rusty
muttered
young
jerry
where
does
my
father
get
all
that
iron
rust
from
he
don
t
get
no
iron
rust
here
ii
a
sight
you
know
the
old
bailey
well
no
doubt
said
one
of
the
oldest
of
clerks
to
jerry
the
messenger
ye
es
sir
returned
jerry
in
something
of
a
dogged
manner
i
do
know
the
bailey
just
so
and
you
know
mr
lorry
i
know
mr
lorry
sir
much
better
than
i
know
the
bailey
much
better
said
jerry
not
unlike
a
reluctant
witness
at
the
establishment
in
question
than
i
as
a
honest
tradesman
wish
to
know
the
bailey
very
well
find
the
door
where
the
witnesses
go
in
and
show
the
door
keeper
this
note
for
mr
lorry
he
will
then
let
you
in
into
the
court
sir
into
the
court
mr
cruncher
s
eyes
seemed
to
get
a
little
closer
to
one
another
and
to
interchange
the
inquiry
what
do
you
think
of
this
am
i
to
wait
in
the
court
sir
he
asked
as
the
result
of
that
conference
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
door
keeper
will
pass
the
note
to
mr
lorry
and
do
you
make
any
gesture
that
will
attract
mr
lorry
s
attention
and
show
him
where
you
stand
then
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
remain
there
until
he
wants
you
is
that
all
sir
that
s
all
he
wishes
to
have
a
messenger
at
hand
this
is
to
tell
him
you
are
there
as
the
ancient
clerk
deliberately
folded
and
superscribed
the
note
mr
cruncher
after
surveying
him
in
silence
until
he
came
to
the
blotting
paper
stage
remarked
i
suppose
they
ll
be
trying
forgeries
this
morning
treason
that
s
quartering
said
jerry
barbarous
it
is
the
law
remarked
the
ancient
clerk
turning
his
surprised
spectacles
upon
him
it
is
the
law
it
s
hard
in
the
law
to
spile
a
man
i
think
it
s
hard
enough
to
kill
him
but
it
s
wery
hard
to
spile
him
sir
not
at
all
retained
the
ancient
clerk
speak
well
of
the
law
take
care
of
your
chest
and
voice
my
good
friend
and
leave
the
law
to
take
care
of
itself
i
give
you
that
advice
it
s
the
damp
sir
what
settles
on
my
chest
and
voice
said
jerry
i
leave
you
to
judge
what
a
damp
way
of
earning
a
living
mine
is
well
well
said
the
old
clerk
we
all
have
our
various
ways
of
gaining
a
livelihood
some
of
us
have
damp
ways
and
some
of
us
have
dry
ways
here
is
the
letter
go
along
jerry
took
the
letter
and
remarking
to
himself
with
less
internal
deference
than
he
made
an
outward
show
of
you
are
a
lean
old
one
too
made
his
bow
informed
his
son
in
passing
of
his
destination
and
went
his
way
they
hanged
at
tyburn
in
those
days
so
the
street
outside
newgate
had
not
obtained
one
infamous
notoriety
that
has
since
attached
to
it
but
the
gaol
was
a
vile
place
in
which
most
kinds
of
debauchery
and
villainy
were
practised
and
where
dire
diseases
were
bred
that
came
into
court
with
the
prisoners
and
sometimes
rushed
straight
from
the
dock
at
my
lord
chief
justice
himself
and
pulled
him
off
the
bench
it
had
more
than
once
happened
that
the
judge
in
the
black
cap
pronounced
his
own
doom
as
certainly
as
the
prisoner
s
and
even
died
before
him
for
the
rest
the
old
bailey
was
famous
as
a
kind
of
deadly
inn
yard
from
which
pale
travellers
set
out
continually
in
carts
and
coaches
on
a
violent
passage
into
the
other
world
traversing
some
two
miles
and
a
half
of
public
street
and
road
and
shaming
few
good
citizens
if
any
so
powerful
is
use
and
so
desirable
to
be
good
use
in
the
beginning
it
was
famous
too
for
the
pillory
a
wise
old
institution
that
inflicted
a
punishment
of
which
no
one
could
foresee
the
extent
also
for
the
whipping
post
another
dear
old
institution
very
humanising
and
softening
to
behold
in
action
also
for
extensive
transactions
in
blood
money
another
fragment
of
ancestral
wisdom
systematically
leading
to
the
most
frightful
mercenary
crimes
that
could
be
committed
under
heaven
altogether
the
old
bailey
at
that
date
was
a
choice
illustration
of
the
precept
that
whatever
is
is
right
an
aphorism
that
would
be
as
final
as
it
is
lazy
did
it
not
include
the
troublesome
consequence
that
nothing
that
ever
was
was
wrong
making
his
way
through
the
tainted
crowd
dispersed
up
and
down
this
hideous
scene
of
action
with
the
skill
of
a
man
accustomed
to
make
his
way
quietly
the
messenger
found
out
the
door
he
sought
and
handed
in
his
letter
through
a
trap
in
it
for
people
then
paid
to
see
the
play
at
the
old
bailey
just
as
they
paid
to
see
the
play
in
bedlam
only
the
former
entertainment
was
much
the
dearer
therefore
all
the
old
bailey
doors
were
well
guarded
except
indeed
the
social
doors
by
which
the
criminals
got
there
and
those
were
always
left
wide
open
after
some
delay
and
demur
the
door
grudgingly
turned
on
its
hinges
a
very
little
way
and
allowed
mr
jerry
cruncher
to
squeeze
himself
into
court
what
s
on
he
asked
in
a
whisper
of
the
man
he
found
himself
next
to
nothing
yet
what
s
coming
on
the
treason
case
the
quartering
one
eh
ah
returned
the
man
with
a
relish
he
ll
be
drawn
on
a
hurdle
to
be
half
hanged
and
then
he
ll
be
taken
down
and
sliced
before
his
own
face
and
then
his
inside
will
be
taken
out
and
burnt
while
he
looks
on
and
then
his
head
will
be
chopped
off
and
he
ll
be
cut
into
quarters
that
s
the
sentence
if
he
s
found
guilty
you
mean
to
say
jerry
added
by
way
of
proviso
oh
they
ll
find
him
guilty
said
the
other
don
t
you
be
afraid
of
that
mr
cruncher
s
attention
was
here
diverted
to
the
door
keeper
whom
he
saw
making
his
way
to
mr
lorry
with
the
note
in
his
hand
mr
lorry
sat
at
a
table
among
the
gentlemen
in
wigs
not
far
from
a
wigged
gentleman
the
prisoner
s
counsel
who
had
a
great
bundle
of
papers
before
him
and
nearly
opposite
another
wigged
gentleman
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
whose
whole
attention
when
mr
cruncher
looked
at
him
then
or
afterwards
seemed
to
be
concentrated
on
the
ceiling
of
the
court
after
some
gruff
coughing
and
rubbing
of
his
chin
and
signing
with
his
hand
jerry
attracted
the
notice
of
mr
lorry
who
had
stood
up
to
look
for
him
and
who
quietly
nodded
and
sat
down
again
what
s
he
got
to
do
with
the
case
asked
the
man
he
had
spoken
with
blest
if
i
know
said
jerry
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
it
then
if
a
person
may
inquire
blest
if
i
know
that
either
said
jerry
the
entrance
of
the
judge
and
a
consequent
great
stir
and
settling
down
in
the
court
stopped
the
dialogue
presently
the
dock
became
the
central
point
of
interest
two
gaolers
who
had
been
standing
there
went
out
and
the
prisoner
was
brought
in
and
put
to
the
bar
everybody
present
except
the
one
wigged
gentleman
who
looked
at
the
ceiling
stared
at
him
all
the
human
breath
in
the
place
rolled
at
him
like
a
sea
or
a
wind
or
a
fire
eager
faces
strained
round
pillars
and
corners
to
get
a
sight
of
him
spectators
in
back
rows
stood
up
not
to
miss
a
hair
of
him
people
on
the
floor
of
the
court
laid
their
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
the
people
before
them
to
help
themselves
at
anybody
s
cost
to
a
view
of
him
stood
a
tiptoe
got
upon
ledges
stood
upon
next
to
nothing
to
see
every
inch
of
him
conspicuous
among
these
latter
like
an
animated
bit
of
the
spiked
wall
of
newgate
jerry
stood
aiming
at
the
prisoner
the
beery
breath
of
a
whet
he
had
taken
as
he
came
along
and
discharging
it
to
mingle
with
the
waves
of
other
beer
and
gin
and
tea
and
coffee
and
what
not
that
flowed
at
him
and
already
broke
upon
the
great
windows
behind
him
in
an
impure
mist
and
rain
the
object
of
all
this
staring
and
blaring
was
a
young
man
of
about
five
and
twenty
well
grown
and
well
looking
with
a
sunburnt
cheek
and
a
dark
eye
his
condition
was
that
of
a
young
gentleman
he
was
plainly
dressed
in
black
or
very
dark
grey
and
his
hair
which
was
long
and
dark
was
gathered
in
a
ribbon
at
the
back
of
his
neck
more
to
be
out
of
his
way
than
for
ornament
as
an
emotion
of
the
mind
will
express
itself
through
any
covering
of
the
body
so
the
paleness
which
his
situation
engendered
came
through
the
brown
upon
his
cheek
showing
the
soul
to
be
stronger
than
the
sun
he
was
otherwise
quite
self
possessed
bowed
to
the
judge
and
stood
quiet
the
sort
of
interest
with
which
this
man
was
stared
and
breathed
at
was
not
a
sort
that
elevated
humanity
had
he
stood
in
peril
of
a
less
horrible
sentence
had
there
been
a
chance
of
any
one
of
its
savage
details
being
spared
by
just
so
much
would
he
have
lost
in
his
fascination
the
form
that
was
to
be
doomed
to
be
so
shamefully
mangled
was
the
sight
the
immortal
creature
that
was
to
be
so
butchered
and
torn
asunder
yielded
the
sensation
whatever
gloss
the
various
spectators
put
upon
the
interest
according
to
their
several
arts
and
powers
of
self
deceit
the
interest
was
at
the
root
of
it
ogreish
silence
in
the
court
charles
darnay
had
yesterday
pleaded
not
guilty
to
an
indictment
denouncing
him
with
infinite
jingle
and
jangle
for
that
he
was
a
false
traitor
to
our
serene
illustrious
excellent
and
so
forth
prince
our
lord
the
king
by
reason
of
his
having
on
divers
occasions
and
by
divers
means
and
ways
assisted
lewis
the
french
king
in
his
wars
against
our
said
serene
illustrious
excellent
and
so
forth
that
was
to
say
by
coming
and
going
between
the
dominions
of
our
said
serene
illustrious
excellent
and
so
forth
and
those
of
the
said
french
lewis
and
wickedly
falsely
traitorously
and
otherwise
evil
adverbiously
revealing
to
the
said
french
lewis
what
forces
our
said
serene
illustrious
excellent
and
so
forth
had
in
preparation
to
send
to
canada
and
north
america
this
much
jerry
with
his
head
becoming
more
and
more
spiky
as
the
law
terms
bristled
it
made
out
with
huge
satisfaction
and
so
arrived
circuitously
at
the
understanding
that
the
aforesaid
and
over
and
over
again
aforesaid
charles
darnay
stood
there
before
him
upon
his
trial
that
the
jury
were
swearing
in
and
that
mr
attorney
general
was
making
ready
to
speak
the
accused
who
was
and
who
knew
he
was
being
mentally
hanged
beheaded
and
quartered
by
everybody
there
neither
flinched
from
the
situation
nor
assumed
any
theatrical
air
in
it
he
was
quiet
and
attentive
watched
the
opening
proceedings
with
a
grave
interest
and
stood
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
slab
of
wood
before
him
so
composedly
that
they
had
not
displaced
a
leaf
of
the
herbs
with
which
it
was
strewn
the
court
was
all
bestrewn
with
herbs
and
sprinkled
with
vinegar
as
a
precaution
against
gaol
air
and
gaol
fever
over
the
prisoner
s
head
there
was
a
mirror
to
throw
the
light
down
upon
him
crowds
of
the
wicked
and
the
wretched
had
been
reflected
in
it
and
had
passed
from
its
surface
and
this
earth
s
together
haunted
in
a
most
ghastly
manner
that
abominable
place
would
have
been
if
the
glass
could
ever
have
rendered
back
its
reflections
as
the
ocean
is
one
day
to
give
up
its
dead
some
passing
thought
of
the
infamy
and
disgrace
for
which
it
had
been
reserved
may
have
struck
the
prisoner
s
mind
be
that
as
it
may
a
change
in
his
position
making
him
conscious
of
a
bar
of
light
across
his
face
he
looked
up
and
when
he
saw
the
glass
his
face
flushed
and
his
right
hand
pushed
the
herbs
away
it
happened
that
the
action
turned
his
face
to
that
side
of
the
court
which
was
on
his
left
about
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
there
sat
in
that
corner
of
the
judge
s
bench
two
persons
upon
whom
his
look
immediately
rested
so
immediately
and
so
much
to
the
changing
of
his
aspect
that
all
the
eyes
that
were
turned
upon
him
turned
to
them
the
spectators
saw
in
the
two
figures
a
young
lady
of
little
more
than
twenty
and
a
gentleman
who
was
evidently
her
father
a
man
of
a
very
remarkable
appearance
in
respect
of
the
absolute
whiteness
of
his
hair
and
a
certain
indescribable
intensity
of
face
not
of
an
active
kind
but
pondering
and
self
communing
when
this
expression
was
upon
him
he
looked
as
if
he
were
old
but
when
it
was
stirred
and
broken
up
as
it
was
now
in
a
moment
on
his
speaking
to
his
daughter
he
became
a
handsome
man
not
past
the
prime
of
life
his
daughter
had
one
of
her
hands
drawn
through
his
arm
as
she
sat
by
him
and
the
other
pressed
upon
it
she
had
drawn
close
to
him
in
her
dread
of
the
scene
and
in
her
pity
for
the
prisoner
her
forehead
had
been
strikingly
expressive
of
an
engrossing
terror
and
compassion
that
saw
nothing
but
the
peril
of
the
accused
this
had
been
so
very
noticeable
so
very
powerfully
and
naturally
shown
that
starers
who
had
had
no
pity
for
him
were
touched
by
her
and
the
whisper
went
about
who
are
they
jerry
the
messenger
who
had
made
his
own
observations
in
his
own
manner
and
who
had
been
sucking
the
rust
off
his
fingers
in
his
absorption
stretched
his
neck
to
hear
who
they
were
the
crowd
about
him
had
pressed
and
passed
the
inquiry
on
to
the
nearest
attendant
and
from
him
it
had
been
more
slowly
pressed
and
passed
back
at
last
it
got
to
jerry
witnesses
for
which
side
against
against
what
side
the
prisoner
s
the
judge
whose
eyes
had
gone
in
the
general
direction
recalled
them
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
looked
steadily
at
the
man
whose
life
was
in
his
hand
as
mr
attorney
general
rose
to
spin
the
rope
grind
the
axe
and
hammer
the
nails
into
the
scaffold
iii
a
disappointment
mr
attorney
general
had
to
inform
the
jury
that
the
prisoner
before
them
though
young
in
years
was
old
in
the
treasonable
practices
which
claimed
the
forfeit
of
his
life
that
this
correspondence
with
the
public
enemy
was
not
a
correspondence
of
to
day
or
of
yesterday
or
even
of
last
year
or
of
the
year
before
that
it
was
certain
the
prisoner
had
for
longer
than
that
been
in
the
habit
of
passing
and
repassing
between
france
and
england
on
secret
business
of
which
he
could
give
no
honest
account
that
if
it
were
in
the
nature
of
traitorous
ways
to
thrive
which
happily
it
never
was
the
real
wickedness
and
guilt
of
his
business
might
have
remained
undiscovered
that
providence
however
had
put
it
into
the
heart
of
a
person
who
was
beyond
fear
and
beyond
reproach
to
ferret
out
the
nature
of
the
prisoner
s
schemes
and
struck
with
horror
to
disclose
them
to
his
majesty
s
chief
secretary
of
state
and
most
honourable
privy
council
that
this
patriot
would
be
produced
before
them
that
his
position
and
attitude
were
on
the
whole
sublime
that
he
had
been
the
prisoner
s
friend
but
at
once
in
an
auspicious
and
an
evil
hour
detecting
his
infamy
had
resolved
to
immolate
the
traitor
he
could
no
longer
cherish
in
his
bosom
on
the
sacred
altar
of
his
country
that
if
statues
were
decreed
in
britain
as
in
ancient
greece
and
rome
to
public
benefactors
this
shining
citizen
would
assuredly
have
had
one
that
as
they
were
not
so
decreed
he
probably
would
not
have
one
that
virtue
as
had
been
observed
by
the
poets
in
many
passages
which
he
well
knew
the
jury
would
have
word
for
word
at
the
tips
of
their
tongues
whereat
the
jury
s
countenances
displayed
a
guilty
consciousness
that
they
knew
nothing
about
the
passages
was
in
a
manner
contagious
more
especially
the
bright
virtue
known
as
patriotism
or
love
of
country
that
the
lofty
example
of
this
immaculate
and
unimpeachable
witness
for
the
crown
to
refer
to
whom
however
unworthily
was
an
honour
had
communicated
itself
to
the
prisoner
s
servant
and
had
engendered
in
him
a
holy
determination
to
examine
his
master
s
table
drawers
and
pockets
and
secrete
his
papers
that
he
mr
attorney
general
was
prepared
to
hear
some
disparagement
attempted
of
this
admirable
servant
but
that
in
a
general
way
he
preferred
him
to
his
mr
attorney
general
s
brothers
and
sisters
and
honoured
him
more
than
his
mr
attorney
general
s
father
and
mother
that
he
called
with
confidence
on
the
jury
to
come
and
do
likewise
that
the
evidence
of
these
two
witnesses
coupled
with
the
documents
of
their
discovering
that
would
be
produced
would
show
the
prisoner
to
have
been
furnished
with
lists
of
his
majesty
s
forces
and
of
their
disposition
and
preparation
both
by
sea
and
land
and
would
leave
no
doubt
that
he
had
habitually
conveyed
such
information
to
a
hostile
power
that
these
lists
could
not
be
proved
to
be
in
the
prisoner
s
handwriting
but
that
it
was
all
the
same
that
indeed
it
was
rather
the
better
for
the
prosecution
as
showing
the
prisoner
to
be
artful
in
his
precautions
that
the
proof
would
go
back
five
years
and
would
show
the
prisoner
already
engaged
in
these
pernicious
missions
within
a
few
weeks
before
the
date
of
the
very
first
action
fought
between
the
british
troops
and
the
americans
that
for
these
reasons
the
jury
being
a
loyal
jury
as
he
knew
they
were
and
being
a
responsible
jury
as
they
knew
they
were
must
positively
find
the
prisoner
guilty
and
make
an
end
of
him
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
that
they
never
could
lay
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
that
they
never
could
tolerate
the
idea
of
their
wives
laying
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
that
they
never
could
endure
the
notion
of
their
children
laying
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
in
short
that
there
never
more
could
be
for
them
or
theirs
any
laying
of
heads
upon
pillows
at
all
unless
the
prisoner
s
head
was
taken
off
that
head
mr
attorney
general
concluded
by
demanding
of
them
in
the
name
of
everything
he
could
think
of
with
a
round
turn
in
it
and
on
the
faith
of
his
solemn
asseveration
that
he
already
considered
the
prisoner
as
good
as
dead
and
gone
when
the
attorney
general
ceased
a
buzz
arose
in
the
court
as
if
a
cloud
of
great
blue
flies
were
swarming
about
the
prisoner
in
anticipation
of
what
he
was
soon
to
become
when
toned
down
again
the
unimpeachable
patriot
appeared
in
the
witness
box
mr
solicitor
general
then
following
his
leader
s
lead
examined
the
patriot
john
barsad
gentleman
by
name
the
story
of
his
pure
soul
was
exactly
what
mr
attorney
general
had
described
it
to
be
perhaps
if
it
had
a
fault
a
little
too
exactly
having
released
his
noble
bosom
of
its
burden
he
would
have
modestly
withdrawn
himself
but
that
the
wigged
gentleman
with
the
papers
before
him
sitting
not
far
from
mr
lorry
begged
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
the
wigged
gentleman
sitting
opposite
still
looking
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
had
he
ever
been
a
spy
himself
no
he
scorned
the
base
insinuation
what
did
he
live
upon
his
property
where
was
his
property
he
didn
t
precisely
remember
where
it
was
what
was
it
no
business
of
anybody
s
had
he
inherited
it
yes
he
had
from
whom
distant
relation
very
distant
rather
ever
been
in
prison
certainly
not
never
in
a
debtors
prison
didn
t
see
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
never
in
a
debtors
prison
come
once
again
never
yes
how
many
times
two
or
three
times
not
five
or
six
perhaps
of
what
profession
gentleman
ever
been
kicked
might
have
been
frequently
no
ever
kicked
downstairs
decidedly
not
once
received
a
kick
on
the
top
of
a
staircase
and
fell
downstairs
of
his
own
accord
kicked
on
that
occasion
for
cheating
at
dice
something
to
that
effect
was
said
by
the
intoxicated
liar
who
committed
the
assault
but
it
was
not
true
swear
it
was
not
true
positively
ever
live
by
cheating
at
play
never
ever
live
by
play
not
more
than
other
gentlemen
do
ever
borrow
money
of
the
prisoner
yes
ever
pay
him
no
was
not
this
intimacy
with
the
prisoner
in
reality
a
very
slight
one
forced
upon
the
prisoner
in
coaches
inns
and
packets
no
sure
he
saw
the
prisoner
with
these
lists
certain
knew
no
more
about
the
lists
no
had
not
procured
them
himself
for
instance
no
expect
to
get
anything
by
this
evidence
no
not
in
regular
government
pay
and
employment
to
lay
traps
oh
dear
no
or
to
do
anything
oh
dear
no
swear
that
over
and
over
again
no
motives
but
motives
of
sheer
patriotism
none
whatever
the
virtuous
servant
roger
cly
swore
his
way
through
the
case
at
a
great
rate
he
had
taken
service
with
the
prisoner
in
good
faith
and
simplicity
four
years
ago
he
had
asked
the
prisoner
aboard
the
calais
packet
if
he
wanted
a
handy
fellow
and
the
prisoner
had
engaged
him
he
had
not
asked
the
prisoner
to
take
the
handy
fellow
as
an
act
of
charity
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
he
began
to
have
suspicions
of
the
prisoner
and
to
keep
an
eye
upon
him
soon
afterwards
in
arranging
his
clothes
while
travelling
he
had
seen
similar
lists
to
these
in
the
prisoner
s
pockets
over
and
over
again
he
had
taken
these
lists
from
the
drawer
of
the
prisoner
s
desk
he
had
not
put
them
there
first
he
had
seen
the
prisoner
show
these
identical
lists
to
french
gentlemen
at
calais
and
similar
lists
to
french
gentlemen
both
at
calais
and
boulogne
he
loved
his
country
and
couldn
t
bear
it
and
had
given
information
he
had
never
been
suspected
of
stealing
a
silver
tea
pot
he
had
been
maligned
respecting
a
mustard
pot
but
it
turned
out
to
be
only
a
plated
one
he
had
known
the
last
witness
seven
or
eight
years
that
was
merely
a
coincidence
he
didn
t
call
it
a
particularly
curious
coincidence
most
coincidences
were
curious
neither
did
he
call
it
a
curious
coincidence
that
true
patriotism
was
his
only
motive
too
he
was
a
true
briton
and
hoped
there
were
many
like
him
the
blue
flies
buzzed
again
and
mr
attorney
general
called
mr
jarvis
lorry
mr
jarvis
lorry
are
you
a
clerk
in
tellson
s
bank
i
am
on
a
certain
friday
night
in
november
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
five
did
business
occasion
you
to
travel
between
london
and
dover
by
the
mail
it
did
were
there
any
other
passengers
in
the
mail
two
did
they
alight
on
the
road
in
the
course
of
the
night
they
did
mr
lorry
look
upon
the
prisoner
was
he
one
of
those
two
passengers
i
cannot
undertake
to
say
that
he
was
does
he
resemble
either
of
these
two
passengers
both
were
so
wrapped
up
and
the
night
was
so
dark
and
we
were
all
so
reserved
that
i
cannot
undertake
to
say
even
that
mr
lorry
look
again
upon
the
prisoner
supposing
him
wrapped
up
as
those
two
passengers
were
is
there
anything
in
his
bulk
and
stature
to
render
it
unlikely
that
he
was
one
of
them
no
you
will
not
swear
mr
lorry
that
he
was
not
one
of
them
no
so
at
least
you
say
he
may
have
been
one
of
them
yes
except
that
i
remember
them
both
to
have
been
like
myself
timorous
of
highwaymen
and
the
prisoner
has
not
a
timorous
air
did
you
ever
see
a
counterfeit
of
timidity
mr
lorry
i
certainly
have
seen
that
mr
lorry
look
once
more
upon
the
prisoner
have
you
seen
him
to
your
certain
knowledge
before
i
have
when
i
was
returning
from
france
a
few
days
afterwards
and
at
calais
the
prisoner
came
on
board
the
packet
ship
in
which
i
returned
and
made
the
voyage
with
me
at
what
hour
did
he
come
on
board
at
a
little
after
midnight
in
the
dead
of
the
night
was
he
the
only
passenger
who
came
on
board
at
that
untimely
hour
he
happened
to
be
the
only
one
never
mind
about
happening
mr
lorry
he
was
the
only
passenger
who
came
on
board
in
the
dead
of
the
night
he
was
were
you
travelling
alone
mr
lorry
or
with
any
companion
with
two
companions
a
gentleman
and
lady
they
are
here
they
are
here
had
you
any
conversation
with
the
prisoner
hardly
any
the
weather
was
stormy
and
the
passage
long
and
rough
and
i
lay
on
a
sofa
almost
from
shore
to
shore
miss
manette
the
young
lady
to
whom
all
eyes
had
been
turned
before
and
were
now
turned
again
stood
up
where
she
had
sat
her
father
rose
with
her
and
kept
her
hand
drawn
through
his
arm
miss
manette
look
upon
the
prisoner
to
be
confronted
with
such
pity
and
such
earnest
youth
and
beauty
was
far
more
trying
to
the
accused
than
to
be
confronted
with
all
the
crowd
standing
as
it
were
apart
with
her
on
the
edge
of
his
grave
not
all
the
staring
curiosity
that
looked
on
could
for
the
moment
nerve
him
to
remain
quite
still
his
hurried
right
hand
parcelled
out
the
herbs
before
him
into
imaginary
beds
of
flowers
in
a
garden
and
his
efforts
to
control
and
steady
his
breathing
shook
the
lips
from
which
the
colour
rushed
to
his
heart
the
buzz
of
the
great
flies
was
loud
again
miss
manette
have
you
seen
the
prisoner
before
yes
sir
where
on
board
of
the
packet
ship
just
now
referred
to
sir
and
on
the
same
occasion
you
are
the
young
lady
just
now
referred
to
o
most
unhappily
i
am
the
plaintive
tone
of
her
compassion
merged
into
the
less
musical
voice
of
the
judge
as
he
said
something
fiercely
answer
the
questions
put
to
you
and
make
no
remark
upon
them
miss
manette
had
you
any
conversation
with
the
prisoner
on
that
passage
across
the
channel
yes
sir
recall
it
in
the
midst
of
a
profound
stillness
she
faintly
began
when
the
gentleman
came
on
board
do
you
mean
the
prisoner
inquired
the
judge
knitting
his
brows
yes
my
lord
then
say
the
prisoner
when
the
prisoner
came
on
board
he
noticed
that
my
father
turning
her
eyes
lovingly
to
him
as
he
stood
beside
her
was
much
fatigued
and
in
a
very
weak
state
of
health
my
father
was
so
reduced
that
i
was
afraid
to
take
him
out
of
the
air
and
i
had
made
a
bed
for
him
on
the
deck
near
the
cabin
steps
and
i
sat
on
the
deck
at
his
side
to
take
care
of
him
there
were
no
other
passengers
that
night
but
we
four
the
prisoner
was
so
good
as
to
beg
permission
to
advise
me
how
i
could
shelter
my
father
from
the
wind
and
weather
better
than
i
had
done
i
had
not
known
how
to
do
it
well
not
understanding
how
the
wind
would
set
when
we
were
out
of
the
harbour
he
did
it
for
me
he
expressed
great
gentleness
and
kindness
for
my
father
s
state
and
i
am
sure
he
felt
it
that
was
the
manner
of
our
beginning
to
speak
together
let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
had
he
come
on
board
alone
no
how
many
were
with
him
two
french
gentlemen
had
they
conferred
together
they
had
conferred
together
until
the
last
moment
when
it
was
necessary
for
the
french
gentlemen
to
be
landed
in
their
boat
had
any
papers
been
handed
about
among
them
similar
to
these
lists
some
papers
had
been
handed
about
among
them
but
i
don
t
know
what
papers
like
these
in
shape
and
size
possibly
but
indeed
i
don
t
know
although
they
stood
whispering
very
near
to
me
because
they
stood
at
the
top
of
the
cabin
steps
to
have
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
was
hanging
there
it
was
a
dull
lamp
and
they
spoke
very
low
and
i
did
not
hear
what
they
said
and
saw
only
that
they
looked
at
papers
now
to
the
prisoner
s
conversation
miss
manette
the
prisoner
was
as
open
in
his
confidence
with
me
which
arose
out
of
my
helpless
situation
as
he
was
kind
and
good
and
useful
to
my
father
i
hope
bursting
into
tears
i
may
not
repay
him
by
doing
him
harm
to
day
buzzing
from
the
blue
flies
miss
manette
if
the
prisoner
does
not
perfectly
understand
that
you
give
the
evidence
which
it
is
your
duty
to
give
which
you
must
give
and
which
you
cannot
escape
from
giving
with
great
unwillingness
he
is
the
only
person
present
in
that
condition
please
to
go
on
he
told
me
that
he
was
travelling
on
business
of
a
delicate
and
difficult
nature
which
might
get
people
into
trouble
and
that
he
was
therefore
travelling
under
an
assumed
name
he
said
that
this
business
had
within
a
few
days
taken
him
to
france
and
might
at
intervals
take
him
backwards
and
forwards
between
france
and
england
for
a
long
time
to
come
did
he
say
anything
about
america
miss
manette
be
particular
he
tried
to
explain
to
me
how
that
quarrel
had
arisen
and
he
said
that
so
far
as
he
could
judge
it
was
a
wrong
and
foolish
one
on
england
s
part
he
added
in
a
jesting
way
that
perhaps
george
washington
might
gain
almost
as
great
a
name
in
history
as
george
the
third
but
there
was
no
harm
in
his
way
of
saying
this
it
was
said
laughingly
and
to
beguile
the
time
any
strongly
marked
expression
of
face
on
the
part
of
a
chief
actor
in
a
scene
of
great
interest
to
whom
many
eyes
are
directed
will
be
unconsciously
imitated
by
the
spectators
her
forehead
was
painfully
anxious
and
intent
as
she
gave
this
evidence
and
in
the
pauses
when
she
stopped
for
the
judge
to
write
it
down
watched
its
effect
upon
the
counsel
for
and
against
among
the
lookers
on
there
was
the
same
expression
in
all
quarters
of
the
court
insomuch
that
a
great
majority
of
the
foreheads
there
might
have
been
mirrors
reflecting
the
witness
when
the
judge
looked
up
from
his
notes
to
glare
at
that
tremendous
heresy
about
george
washington
mr
attorney
general
now
signified
to
my
lord
that
he
deemed
it
necessary
as
a
matter
of
precaution
and
form
to
call
the
young
lady
s
father
doctor
manette
who
was
called
accordingly
doctor
manette
look
upon
the
prisoner
have
you
ever
seen
him
before
once
when
he
called
at
my
lodgings
in
london
some
three
years
or
three
years
and
a
half
ago
can
you
identify
him
as
your
fellow
passenger
on
board
the
packet
or
speak
to
his
conversation
with
your
daughter
sir
i
can
do
neither
is
there
any
particular
and
special
reason
for
your
being
unable
to
do
either
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
there
is
has
it
been
your
misfortune
to
undergo
a
long
imprisonment
without
trial
or
even
accusation
in
your
native
country
doctor
manette
he
answered
in
a
tone
that
went
to
every
heart
a
long
imprisonment
were
you
newly
released
on
the
occasion
in
question
they
tell
me
so
have
you
no
remembrance
of
the
occasion
none
my
mind
is
a
blank
from
some
time
i
cannot
even
say
what
time
when
i
employed
myself
in
my
captivity
in
making
shoes
to
the
time
when
i
found
myself
living
in
london
with
my
dear
daughter
here
she
had
become
familiar
to
me
when
a
gracious
god
restored
my
faculties
but
i
am
quite
unable
even
to
say
how
she
had
become
familiar
i
have
no
remembrance
of
the
process
mr
attorney
general
sat
down
and
the
father
and
daughter
sat
down
together
a
singular
circumstance
then
arose
in
the
case
the
object
in
hand
being
to
show
that
the
prisoner
went
down
with
some
fellow
plotter
untracked
in
the
dover
mail
on
that
friday
night
in
november
five
years
ago
and
got
out
of
the
mail
in
the
night
as
a
blind
at
a
place
where
he
did
not
remain
but
from
which
he
travelled
back
some
dozen
miles
or
more
to
a
garrison
and
dockyard
and
there
collected
information
a
witness
was
called
to
identify
him
as
having
been
at
the
precise
time
required
in
the
coffee
room
of
an
hotel
in
that
garrison
and
dockyard
town
waiting
for
another
person
the
prisoner
s
counsel
was
cross
examining
this
witness
with
no
result
except
that
he
had
never
seen
the
prisoner
on
any
other
occasion
when
the
wigged
gentleman
who
had
all
this
time
been
looking
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
wrote
a
word
or
two
on
a
little
piece
of
paper
screwed
it
up
and
tossed
it
to
him
opening
this
piece
of
paper
in
the
next
pause
the
counsel
looked
with
great
attention
and
curiosity
at
the
prisoner
you
say
again
you
are
quite
sure
that
it
was
the
prisoner
the
witness
was
quite
sure
did
you
ever
see
anybody
very
like
the
prisoner
not
so
like
the
witness
said
as
that
he
could
be
mistaken
look
well
upon
that
gentleman
my
learned
friend
there
pointing
to
him
who
had
tossed
the
paper
over
and
then
look
well
upon
the
prisoner
how
say
you
are
they
very
like
each
other
allowing
for
my
learned
friend
s
appearance
being
careless
and
slovenly
if
not
debauched
they
were
sufficiently
like
each
other
to
surprise
not
only
the
witness
but
everybody
present
when
they
were
thus
brought
into
comparison
my
lord
being
prayed
to
bid
my
learned
friend
lay
aside
his
wig
and
giving
no
very
gracious
consent
the
likeness
became
much
more
remarkable
my
lord
inquired
of
mr
stryver
the
prisoner
s
counsel
whether
they
were
next
to
try
mr
carton
name
of
my
learned
friend
for
treason
but
mr
stryver
replied
to
my
lord
no
but
he
would
ask
the
witness
to
tell
him
whether
what
happened
once
might
happen
twice
whether
he
would
have
been
so
confident
if
he
had
seen
this
illustration
of
his
rashness
sooner
whether
he
would
be
so
confident
having
seen
it
and
more
the
upshot
of
which
was
to
smash
this
witness
like
a
crockery
vessel
and
shiver
his
part
of
the
case
to
useless
lumber
mr
cruncher
had
by
this
time
taken
quite
a
lunch
of
rust
off
his
fingers
in
his
following
of
the
evidence
he
had
now
to
attend
while
mr
stryver
fitted
the
prisoner
s
case
on
the
jury
like
a
compact
suit
of
clothes
showing
them
how
the
patriot
barsad
was
a
hired
spy
and
traitor
an
unblushing
trafficker
in
blood
and
one
of
the
greatest
scoundrels
upon
earth
since
accursed
judas
which
he
certainly
did
look
rather
like
how
the
virtuous
servant
cly
was
his
friend
and
partner
and
was
worthy
to
be
how
the
watchful
eyes
of
those
forgers
and
false
swearers
had
rested
on
the
prisoner
as
a
victim
because
some
family
affairs
in
france
he
being
of
french
extraction
did
require
his
making
those
passages
across
the
channel
though
what
those
affairs
were
a
consideration
for
others
who
were
near
and
dear
to
him
forbade
him
even
for
his
life
to
disclose
how
the
evidence
that
had
been
warped
and
wrested
from
the
young
lady
whose
anguish
in
giving
it
they
had
witnessed
came
to
nothing
involving
the
mere
little
innocent
gallantries
and
politenesses
likely
to
pass
between
any
young
gentleman
and
young
lady
so
thrown
together
with
the
exception
of
that
reference
to
george
washington
which
was
altogether
too
extravagant
and
impossible
to
be
regarded
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
monstrous
joke
how
it
would
be
a
weakness
in
the
government
to
break
down
in
this
attempt
to
practise
for
popularity
on
the
lowest
national
antipathies
and
fears
and
therefore
mr
attorney
general
had
made
the
most
of
it
how
nevertheless
it
rested
upon
nothing
save
that
vile
and
infamous
character
of
evidence
too
often
disfiguring
such
cases
and
of
which
the
state
trials
of
this
country
were
full
but
there
my
lord
interposed
with
as
grave
a
face
as
if
it
had
not
been
true
saying
that
he
could
not
sit
upon
that
bench
and
suffer
those
allusions
mr
stryver
then
called
his
few
witnesses
and
mr
cruncher
had
next
to
attend
while
mr
attorney
general
turned
the
whole
suit
of
clothes
mr
stryver
had
fitted
on
the
jury
inside
out
showing
how
barsad
and
cly
were
even
a
hundred
times
better
than
he
had
thought
them
and
the
prisoner
a
hundred
times
worse
lastly
came
my
lord
himself
turning
the
suit
of
clothes
now
inside
out
now
outside
in
but
on
the
whole
decidedly
trimming
and
shaping
them
into
grave
clothes
for
the
prisoner
and
now
the
jury
turned
to
consider
and
the
great
flies
swarmed
again
mr
carton
who
had
so
long
sat
looking
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
changed
neither
his
place
nor
his
attitude
even
in
this
excitement
while
his
learned
friend
mr
stryver
massing
his
papers
before
him
whispered
with
those
who
sat
near
and
from
time
to
time
glanced
anxiously
at
the
jury
while
all
the
spectators
moved
more
or
less
and
grouped
themselves
anew
while
even
my
lord
himself
arose
from
his
seat
and
slowly
paced
up
and
down
his
platform
not
unattended
by
a
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
the
audience
that
his
state
was
feverish
this
one
man
sat
leaning
back
with
his
torn
gown
half
off
him
his
untidy
wig
put
on
just
as
it
had
happened
to
light
on
his
head
after
its
removal
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
on
the
ceiling
as
they
had
been
all
day
something
especially
reckless
in
his
demeanour
not
only
gave
him
a
disreputable
look
but
so
diminished
the
strong
resemblance
he
undoubtedly
bore
to
the
prisoner
which
his
momentary
earnestness
when
they
were
compared
together
had
strengthened
that
many
of
the
lookers
on
taking
note
of
him
now
said
to
one
another
they
would
hardly
have
thought
the
two
were
so
alike
mr
cruncher
made
the
observation
to
his
next
neighbour
and
added
i
d
hold
half
a
guinea
that
he
don
t
get
no
law
work
to
do
don
t
look
like
the
sort
of
one
to
get
any
do
he
yet
this
mr
carton
took
in
more
of
the
details
of
the
scene
than
he
appeared
to
take
in
for
now
when
miss
manette
s
head
dropped
upon
her
father
s
breast
he
was
the
first
to
see
it
and
to
say
audibly
officer
look
to
that
young
lady
help
the
gentleman
to
take
her
out
don
t
you
see
she
will
fall
there
was
much
commiseration
for
her
as
she
was
removed
and
much
sympathy
with
her
father
it
had
evidently
been
a
great
distress
to
him
to
have
the
days
of
his
imprisonment
recalled
he
had
shown
strong
internal
agitation
when
he
was
questioned
and
that
pondering
or
brooding
look
which
made
him
old
had
been
upon
him
like
a
heavy
cloud
ever
since
as
he
passed
out
the
jury
who
had
turned
back
and
paused
a
moment
spoke
through
their
foreman
they
were
not
agreed
and
wished
to
retire
my
lord
perhaps
with
george
washington
on
his
mind
showed
some
surprise
that
they
were
not
agreed
but
signified
his
pleasure
that
they
should
retire
under
watch
and
ward
and
retired
himself
the
trial
had
lasted
all
day
and
the
lamps
in
the
court
were
now
being
lighted
it
began
to
be
rumoured
that
the
jury
would
be
out
a
long
while
the
spectators
dropped
off
to
get
refreshment
and
the
prisoner
withdrew
to
the
back
of
the
dock
and
sat
down
mr
lorry
who
had
gone
out
when
the
young
lady
and
her
father
went
out
now
reappeared
and
beckoned
to
jerry
who
in
the
slackened
interest
could
easily
get
near
him
jerry
if
you
wish
to
take
something
to
eat
you
can
but
keep
in
the
way
you
will
be
sure
to
hear
when
the
jury
come
in
don
t
be
a
moment
behind
them
for
i
want
you
to
take
the
verdict
back
to
the
bank
you
are
the
quickest
messenger
i
know
and
will
get
to
temple
bar
long
before
i
can
jerry
had
just
enough
forehead
to
knuckle
and
he
knuckled
it
in
acknowledgment
of
this
communication
and
a
shilling
mr
carton
came
up
at
the
moment
and
touched
mr
lorry
on
the
arm
how
is
the
young
lady
she
is
greatly
distressed
but
her
father
is
comforting
her
and
she
feels
the
better
for
being
out
of
court
i
ll
tell
the
prisoner
so
it
won
t
do
for
a
respectable
bank
gentleman
like
you
to
be
seen
speaking
to
him
publicly
you
know
mr
lorry
reddened
as
if
he
were
conscious
of
having
debated
the
point
in
his
mind
and
mr
carton
made
his
way
to
the
outside
of
the
bar
the
way
out
of
court
lay
in
that
direction
and
jerry
followed
him
all
eyes
ears
and
spikes
mr
darnay
the
prisoner
came
forward
directly
you
will
naturally
be
anxious
to
hear
of
the
witness
miss
manette
she
will
do
very
well
you
have
seen
the
worst
of
her
agitation
i
am
deeply
sorry
to
have
been
the
cause
of
it
could
you
tell
her
so
for
me
with
my
fervent
acknowledgments
yes
i
could
i
will
if
you
ask
it
mr
carton
s
manner
was
so
careless
as
to
be
almost
insolent
he
stood
half
turned
from
the
prisoner
lounging
with
his
elbow
against
the
bar
i
do
ask
it
accept
my
cordial
thanks
what
said
carton
still
only
half
turned
towards
him
do
you
expect
mr
darnay
the
worst
it
s
the
wisest
thing
to
expect
and
the
likeliest
but
i
think
their
withdrawing
is
in
your
favour
loitering
on
the
way
out
of
court
not
being
allowed
jerry
heard
no
more
but
left
them
so
like
each
other
in
feature
so
unlike
each
other
in
manner
standing
side
by
side
both
reflected
in
the
glass
above
them
an
hour
and
a
half
limped
heavily
away
in
the
thief
and
rascal
crowded
passages
below
even
though
assisted
off
with
mutton
pies
and
ale
the
hoarse
messenger
uncomfortably
seated
on
a
form
after
taking
that
refection
had
dropped
into
a
doze
when
a
loud
murmur
and
a
rapid
tide
of
people
setting
up
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
court
carried
him
along
with
them
jerry
jerry
mr
lorry
was
already
calling
at
the
door
when
he
got
there
here
sir
it
s
a
fight
to
get
back
again
here
i
am
sir
mr
lorry
handed
him
a
paper
through
the
throng
quick
have
you
got
it
yes
sir
hastily
written
on
the
paper
was
the
word
acquitted
if
you
had
sent
the
message
recalled
to
life
again
muttered
jerry
as
he
turned
i
should
have
known
what
you
meant
this
time
he
had
no
opportunity
of
saying
or
so
much
as
thinking
anything
else
until
he
was
clear
of
the
old
bailey
for
the
crowd
came
pouring
out
with
a
vehemence
that
nearly
took
him
off
his
legs
and
a
loud
buzz
swept
into
the
street
as
if
the
baffled
blue
flies
were
dispersing
in
search
of
other
carrion
iv
congratulatory
from
the
dimly
lighted
passages
of
the
court
the
last
sediment
of
the
human
stew
that
had
been
boiling
there
all
day
was
straining
off
when
doctor
manette
lucie
manette
his
daughter
mr
lorry
the
solicitor
for
the
defence
and
its
counsel
mr
stryver
stood
gathered
round
mr
charles
darnay
just
released
congratulating
him
on
his
escape
from
death
it
would
have
been
difficult
by
a
far
brighter
light
to
recognise
in
doctor
manette
intellectual
of
face
and
upright
of
bearing
the
shoemaker
of
the
garret
in
paris
yet
no
one
could
have
looked
at
him
twice
without
looking
again
even
though
the
opportunity
of
observation
had
not
extended
to
the
mournful
cadence
of
his
low
grave
voice
and
to
the
abstraction
that
overclouded
him
fitfully
without
any
apparent
reason
while
one
external
cause
and
that
a
reference
to
his
long
lingering
agony
would
always
as
on
the
trial
evoke
this
condition
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
it
was
also
in
its
nature
to
arise
of
itself
and
to
draw
a
gloom
over
him
as
incomprehensible
to
those
unacquainted
with
his
story
as
if
they
had
seen
the
shadow
of
the
actual
bastille
thrown
upon
him
by
a
summer
sun
when
the
substance
was
three
hundred
miles
away
only
his
daughter
had
the
power
of
charming
this
black
brooding
from
his
mind
she
was
the
golden
thread
that
united
him
to
a
past
beyond
his
misery
and
to
a
present
beyond
his
misery
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
light
of
her
face
the
touch
of
her
hand
had
a
strong
beneficial
influence
with
him
almost
always
not
absolutely
always
for
she
could
recall
some
occasions
on
which
her
power
had
failed
but
they
were
few
and
slight
and
she
believed
them
over
mr
darnay
had
kissed
her
hand
fervently
and
gratefully
and
had
turned
to
mr
stryver
whom
he
warmly
thanked
mr
stryver
a
man
of
little
more
than
thirty
but
looking
twenty
years
older
than
he
was
stout
loud
red
bluff
and
free
from
any
drawback
of
delicacy
had
a
pushing
way
of
shouldering
himself
morally
and
physically
into
companies
and
conversations
that
argued
well
for
his
shouldering
his
way
up
in
life
he
still
had
his
wig
and
gown
on
and
he
said
squaring
himself
at
his
late
client
to
that
degree
that
he
squeezed
the
innocent
mr
lorry
clean
out
of
the
group
i
am
glad
to
have
brought
you
off
with
honour
mr
darnay
it
was
an
infamous
prosecution
grossly
infamous
but
not
the
less
likely
to
succeed
on
that
account
you
have
laid
me
under
an
obligation
to
you
for
life
in
two
senses
said
his
late
client
taking
his
hand
i
have
done
my
best
for
you
mr
darnay
and
my
best
is
as
good
as
another
man
s
i
believe
it
clearly
being
incumbent
on
some
one
to
say
much
better
mr
lorry
said
it
perhaps
not
quite
disinterestedly
but
with
the
interested
object
of
squeezing
himself
back
again
you
think
so
said
mr
stryver
well
you
have
been
present
all
day
and
you
ought
to
know
you
are
a
man
of
business
too
and
as
such
quoth
mr
lorry
whom
the
counsel
learned
in
the
law
had
now
shouldered
back
into
the
group
just
as
he
had
previously
shouldered
him
out
of
it
as
such
i
will
appeal
to
doctor
manette
to
break
up
this
conference
and
order
us
all
to
our
homes
miss
lucie
looks
ill
mr
darnay
has
had
a
terrible
day
we
are
worn
out
speak
for
yourself
mr
lorry
said
stryver
i
have
a
night
s
work
to
do
yet
speak
for
yourself
i
speak
for
myself
answered
mr
lorry
and
for
mr
darnay
and
for
miss
lucie
and
miss
lucie
do
you
not
think
i
may
speak
for
us
all
he
asked
her
the
question
pointedly
and
with
a
glance
at
her
father
his
face
had
become
frozen
as
it
were
in
a
very
curious
look
at
darnay
an
intent
look
deepening
into
a
frown
of
dislike
and
distrust
not
even
unmixed
with
fear
with
this
strange
expression
on
him
his
thoughts
had
wandered
away
my
father
said
lucie
softly
laying
her
hand
on
his
he
slowly
shook
the
shadow
off
and
turned
to
her
shall
we
go
home
my
father
with
a
long
breath
he
answered
yes
the
friends
of
the
acquitted
prisoner
had
dispersed
under
the
impression
which
he
himself
had
originated
that
he
would
not
be
released
that
night
the
lights
were
nearly
all
extinguished
in
the
passages
the
iron
gates
were
being
closed
with
a
jar
and
a
rattle
and
the
dismal
place
was
deserted
until
to
morrow
morning
s
interest
of
gallows
pillory
whipping
post
and
branding
iron
should
repeople
it
walking
between
her
father
and
mr
darnay
lucie
manette
passed
into
the
open
air
a
hackney
coach
was
called
and
the
father
and
daughter
departed
in
it
mr
stryver
had
left
them
in
the
passages
to
shoulder
his
way
back
to
the
robing
room
another
person
who
had
not
joined
the
group
or
interchanged
a
word
with
any
one
of
them
but
who
had
been
leaning
against
the
wall
where
its
shadow
was
darkest
had
silently
strolled
out
after
the
rest
and
had
looked
on
until
the
coach
drove
away
he
now
stepped
up
to
where
mr
lorry
and
mr
darnay
stood
upon
the
pavement
so
mr
lorry
men
of
business
may
speak
to
mr
darnay
now
nobody
had
made
any
acknowledgment
of
mr
carton
s
part
in
the
day
s
proceedings
nobody
had
known
of
it
he
was
unrobed
and
was
none
the
better
for
it
in
appearance
if
you
knew
what
a
conflict
goes
on
in
the
business
mind
when
the
business
mind
is
divided
between
good
natured
impulse
and
business
appearances
you
would
be
amused
mr
darnay
mr
lorry
reddened
and
said
warmly
you
have
mentioned
that
before
sir
we
men
of
business
who
serve
a
house
are
not
our
own
masters
we
have
to
think
of
the
house
more
than
ourselves
i
know
i
know
rejoined
mr
carton
carelessly
don
t
be
nettled
mr
lorry
you
are
as
good
as
another
i
have
no
doubt
better
i
dare
say
and
indeed
sir
pursued
mr
lorry
not
minding
him
i
really
don
t
know
what
you
have
to
do
with
the
matter
if
you
ll
excuse
me
as
very
much
your
elder
for
saying
so
i
really
don
t
know
that
it
is
your
business
business
bless
you
i
have
no
business
said
mr
carton
it
is
a
pity
you
have
not
sir
i
think
so
too
if
you
had
pursued
mr
lorry
perhaps
you
would
attend
to
it
lord
love
you
no
i
shouldn
t
said
mr
carton
well
sir
cried
mr
lorry
thoroughly
heated
by
his
indifference
business
is
a
very
good
thing
and
a
very
respectable
thing
and
sir
if
business
imposes
its
restraints
and
its
silences
and
impediments
mr
darnay
as
a
young
gentleman
of
generosity
knows
how
to
make
allowance
for
that
circumstance
mr
darnay
good
night
god
bless
you
sir
i
hope
you
have
been
this
day
preserved
for
a
prosperous
and
happy
life
chair
there
perhaps
a
little
angry
with
himself
as
well
as
with
the
barrister
mr
lorry
bustled
into
the
chair
and
was
carried
off
to
tellson
s
carton
who
smelt
of
port
wine
and
did
not
appear
to
be
quite
sober
laughed
then
and
turned
to
darnay
this
is
a
strange
chance
that
throws
you
and
me
together
this
must
be
a
strange
night
to
you
standing
alone
here
with
your
counterpart
on
these
street
stones
i
hardly
seem
yet
returned
charles
darnay
to
belong
to
this
world
again
i
don
t
wonder
at
it
it
s
not
so
long
since
you
were
pretty
far
advanced
on
your
way
to
another
you
speak
faintly
i
begin
to
think
i
am
faint
then
why
the
devil
don
t
you
dine
i
dined
myself
while
those
numskulls
were
deliberating
which
world
you
should
belong
to
this
or
some
other
let
me
show
you
the
nearest
tavern
to
dine
well
at
drawing
his
arm
through
his
own
he
took
him
down
ludgate
hill
to
fleet
street
and
so
up
a
covered
way
into
a
tavern
here
they
were
shown
into
a
little
room
where
charles
darnay
was
soon
recruiting
his
strength
with
a
good
plain
dinner
and
good
wine
while
carton
sat
opposite
to
him
at
the
same
table
with
his
separate
bottle
of
port
before
him
and
his
fully
half
insolent
manner
upon
him
do
you
feel
yet
that
you
belong
to
this
terrestrial
scheme
again
mr
darnay
i
am
frightfully
confused
regarding
time
and
place
but
i
am
so
far
mended
as
to
feel
that
it
must
be
an
immense
satisfaction
he
said
it
bitterly
and
filled
up
his
glass
again
which
was
a
large
one
as
to
me
the
greatest
desire
i
have
is
to
forget
that
i
belong
to
it
it
has
no
good
in
it
for
me
except
wine
like
this
nor
i
for
it
so
we
are
not
much
alike
in
that
particular
indeed
i
begin
to
think
we
are
not
much
alike
in
any
particular
you
and
i
confused
by
the
emotion
of
the
day
and
feeling
his
being
there
with
this
double
of
coarse
deportment
to
be
like
a
dream
charles
darnay
was
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
finally
answered
not
at
all
now
your
dinner
is
done
carton
presently
said
why
don
t
you
call
a
health
mr
darnay
why
don
t
you
give
your
toast
what
health
what
toast
why
it
s
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
it
ought
to
be
it
must
be
i
ll
swear
it
s
there
miss
manette
then
miss
manette
then
looking
his
companion
full
in
the
face
while
he
drank
the
toast
carton
flung
his
glass
over
his
shoulder
against
the
wall
where
it
shivered
to
pieces
then
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
in
another
that
s
a
fair
young
lady
to
hand
to
a
coach
in
the
dark
mr
darnay
he
said
filling
his
new
goblet
a
slight
frown
and
a
laconic
yes
were
the
answer
that
s
a
fair
young
lady
to
be
pitied
by
and
wept
for
by
how
does
it
feel
is
it
worth
being
tried
for
one
s
life
to
be
the
object
of
such
sympathy
and
compassion
mr
darnay
again
darnay
answered
not
a
word
she
was
mightily
pleased
to
have
your
message
when
i
gave
it
her
not
that
she
showed
she
was
pleased
but
i
suppose
she
was
the
allusion
served
as
a
timely
reminder
to
darnay
that
this
disagreeable
companion
had
of
his
own
free
will
assisted
him
in
the
strait
of
the
day
he
turned
the
dialogue
to
that
point
and
thanked
him
for
it
i
neither
want
any
thanks
nor
merit
any
was
the
careless
rejoinder
it
was
nothing
to
do
in
the
first
place
and
i
don
t
know
why
i
did
it
in
the
second
mr
darnay
let
me
ask
you
a
question
willingly
and
a
small
return
for
your
good
offices
do
you
think
i
particularly
like
you
really
mr
carton
returned
the
other
oddly
disconcerted
i
have
not
asked
myself
the
question
but
ask
yourself
the
question
now
you
have
acted
as
if
you
do
but
i
don
t
think
you
do
i
don
t
think
i
do
said
carton
i
begin
to
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
your
understanding
nevertheless
pursued
darnay
rising
to
ring
the
bell
there
is
nothing
in
that
i
hope
to
prevent
my
calling
the
reckoning
and
our
parting
without
ill
blood
on
either
side
carton
rejoining
nothing
in
life
darnay
rang
do
you
call
the
whole
reckoning
said
carton
on
his
answering
in
the
affirmative
then
bring
me
another
pint
of
this
same
wine
drawer
and
come
and
wake
me
at
ten
the
bill
being
paid
charles
darnay
rose
and
wished
him
good
night
without
returning
the
wish
carton
rose
too
with
something
of
a
threat
of
defiance
in
his
manner
and
said
a
last
word
mr
darnay
you
think
i
am
drunk
i
think
you
have
been
drinking
mr
carton
think
you
know
i
have
been
drinking
since
i
must
say
so
i
know
it
then
you
shall
likewise
know
why
i
am
a
disappointed
drudge
sir
i
care
for
no
man
on
earth
and
no
man
on
earth
cares
for
me
much
to
be
regretted
you
might
have
used
your
talents
better
may
be
so
mr
darnay
may
be
not
don
t
let
your
sober
face
elate
you
however
you
don
t
know
what
it
may
come
to
good
night
when
he
was
left
alone
this
strange
being
took
up
a
candle
went
to
a
glass
that
hung
against
the
wall
and
surveyed
himself
minutely
in
it
do
you
particularly
like
the
man
he
muttered
at
his
own
image
why
should
you
particularly
like
a
man
who
resembles
you
there
is
nothing
in
you
to
like
you
know
that
ah
confound
you
what
a
change
you
have
made
in
yourself
a
good
reason
for
taking
to
a
man
that
he
shows
you
what
you
have
fallen
away
from
and
what
you
might
have
been
change
places
with
him
and
would
you
have
been
looked
at
by
those
blue
eyes
as
he
was
and
commiserated
by
that
agitated
face
as
he
was
come
on
and
have
it
out
in
plain
words
you
hate
the
fellow
he
resorted
to
his
pint
of
wine
for
consolation
drank
it
all
in
a
few
minutes
and
fell
asleep
on
his
arms
with
his
hair
straggling
over
the
table
and
a
long
winding
sheet
in
the
candle
dripping
down
upon
him
v
the
jackal
those
were
drinking
days
and
most
men
drank
hard
so
very
great
is
the
improvement
time
has
brought
about
in
such
habits
that
a
moderate
statement
of
the
quantity
of
wine
and
punch
which
one
man
would
swallow
in
the
course
of
a
night
without
any
detriment
to
his
reputation
as
a
perfect
gentleman
would
seem
in
these
days
a
ridiculous
exaggeration
the
learned
profession
of
the
law
was
certainly
not
behind
any
other
learned
profession
in
its
bacchanalian
propensities
neither
was
mr
stryver
already
fast
shouldering
his
way
to
a
large
and
lucrative
practice
behind
his
compeers
in
this
particular
any
more
than
in
the
drier
parts
of
the
legal
race
a
favourite
at
the
old
bailey
and
eke
at
the
sessions
mr
stryver
had
begun
cautiously
to
hew
away
the
lower
staves
of
the
ladder
on
which
he
mounted
sessions
and
old
bailey
had
now
to
summon
their
favourite
specially
to
their
longing
arms
and
shouldering
itself
towards
the
visage
of
the
lord
chief
justice
in
the
court
of
king
s
bench
the
florid
countenance
of
mr
stryver
might
be
daily
seen
bursting
out
of
the
bed
of
wigs
like
a
great
sunflower
pushing
its
way
at
the
sun
from
among
a
rank
garden
full
of
flaring
companions
it
had
once
been
noted
at
the
bar
that
while
mr
stryver
was
a
glib
man
and
an
unscrupulous
and
a
ready
and
a
bold
he
had
not
that
faculty
of
extracting
the
essence
from
a
heap
of
statements
which
is
among
the
most
striking
and
necessary
of
the
advocate
s
accomplishments
but
a
remarkable
improvement
came
upon
him
as
to
this
the
more
business
he
got
the
greater
his
power
seemed
to
grow
of
getting
at
its
pith
and
marrow
and
however
late
at
night
he
sat
carousing
with
sydney
carton
he
always
had
his
points
at
his
fingers
ends
in
the
morning
sydney
carton
idlest
and
most
unpromising
of
men
was
stryver
s
great
ally
what
the
two
drank
together
between
hilary
term
and
michaelmas
might
have
floated
a
king
s
ship
stryver
never
had
a
case
in
hand
anywhere
but
carton
was
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
at
the
ceiling
of
the
court
they
went
the
same
circuit
and
even
there
they
prolonged
their
usual
orgies
late
into
the
night
and
carton
was
rumoured
to
be
seen
at
broad
day
going
home
stealthily
and
unsteadily
to
his
lodgings
like
a
dissipated
cat
at
last
it
began
to
get
about
among
such
as
were
interested
in
the
matter
that
although
sydney
carton
would
never
be
a
lion
he
was
an
amazingly
good
jackal
and
that
he
rendered
suit
and
service
to
stryver
in
that
humble
capacity
ten
o
clock
sir
said
the
man
at
the
tavern
whom
he
had
charged
to
wake
him
ten
o
clock
sir
what
s
the
matter
ten
o
clock
sir
what
do
you
mean
ten
o
clock
at
night
yes
sir
your
honour
told
me
to
call
you
oh
i
remember
very
well
very
well
after
a
few
dull
efforts
to
get
to
sleep
again
which
the
man
dexterously
combated
by
stirring
the
fire
continuously
for
five
minutes
he
got
up
tossed
his
hat
on
and
walked
out
he
turned
into
the
temple
and
having
revived
himself
by
twice
pacing
the
pavements
of
king
s
bench
walk
and
paper
buildings
turned
into
the
stryver
chambers
the
stryver
clerk
who
never
assisted
at
these
conferences
had
gone
home
and
the
stryver
principal
opened
the
door
he
had
his
slippers
on
and
a
loose
bed
gown
and
his
throat
was
bare
for
his
greater
ease
he
had
that
rather
wild
strained
seared
marking
about
the
eyes
which
may
be
observed
in
all
free
livers
of
his
class
from
the
portrait
of
jeffries
downward
and
which
can
be
traced
under
various
disguises
of
art
through
the
portraits
of
every
drinking
age
you
are
a
little
late
memory
said
stryver
about
the
usual
time
it
may
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
they
went
into
a
dingy
room
lined
with
books
and
littered
with
papers
where
there
was
a
blazing
fire
a
kettle
steamed
upon
the
hob
and
in
the
midst
of
the
wreck
of
papers
a
table
shone
with
plenty
of
wine
upon
it
and
brandy
and
rum
and
sugar
and
lemons
you
have
had
your
bottle
i
perceive
sydney
two
to
night
i
think
i
have
been
dining
with
the
day
s
client
or
seeing
him
dine
it
s
all
one
that
was
a
rare
point
sydney
that
you
brought
to
bear
upon
the
identification
how
did
you
come
by
it
when
did
it
strike
you
i
thought
he
was
rather
a
handsome
fellow
and
i
thought
i
should
have
been
much
the
same
sort
of
fellow
if
i
had
had
any
luck
mr
stryver
laughed
till
he
shook
his
precocious
paunch
you
and
your
luck
sydney
get
to
work
get
to
work
sullenly
enough
the
jackal
loosened
his
dress
went
into
an
adjoining
room
and
came
back
with
a
large
jug
of
cold
water
a
basin
and
a
towel
or
two
steeping
the
towels
in
the
water
and
partially
wringing
them
out
he
folded
them
on
his
head
in
a
manner
hideous
to
behold
sat
down
at
the
table
and
said
now
i
am
ready
not
much
boiling
down
to
be
done
to
night
memory
said
mr
stryver
gaily
as
he
looked
among
his
papers
how
much
only
two
sets
of
them
give
me
the
worst
first
there
they
are
sydney
fire
away
the
lion
then
composed
himself
on
his
back
on
a
sofa
on
one
side
of
the
drinking
table
while
the
jackal
sat
at
his
own
paper
bestrewn
table
proper
on
the
other
side
of
it
with
the
bottles
and
glasses
ready
to
his
hand
both
resorted
to
the
drinking
table
without
stint
but
each
in
a
different
way
the
lion
for
the
most
part
reclining
with
his
hands
in
his
waistband
looking
at
the
fire
or
occasionally
flirting
with
some
lighter
document
the
jackal
with
knitted
brows
and
intent
face
so
deep
in
his
task
that
his
eyes
did
not
even
follow
the
hand
he
stretched
out
for
his
glass
which
often
groped
about
for
a
minute
or
more
before
it
found
the
glass
for
his
lips
two
or
three
times
the
matter
in
hand
became
so
knotty
that
the
jackal
found
it
imperative
on
him
to
get
up
and
steep
his
towels
anew
from
these
pilgrimages
to
the
jug
and
basin
he
returned
with
such
eccentricities
of
damp
headgear
as
no
words
can
describe
which
were
made
the
more
ludicrous
by
his
anxious
gravity
at
length
the
jackal
had
got
together
a
compact
repast
for
the
lion
and
proceeded
to
offer
it
to
him
the
lion
took
it
with
care
and
caution
made
his
selections
from
it
and
his
remarks
upon
it
and
the
jackal
assisted
both
when
the
repast
was
fully
discussed
the
lion
put
his
hands
in
his
waistband
again
and
lay
down
to
meditate
the
jackal
then
invigorated
himself
with
a
bumper
for
his
throttle
and
a
fresh
application
to
his
head
and
applied
himself
to
the
collection
of
a
second
meal
this
was
administered
to
the
lion
in
the
same
manner
and
was
not
disposed
of
until
the
clocks
struck
three
in
the
morning
and
now
we
have
done
sydney
fill
a
bumper
of
punch
said
mr
stryver
the
jackal
removed
the
towels
from
his
head
which
had
been
steaming
again
shook
himself
yawned
shivered
and
complied
you
were
very
sound
sydney
in
the
matter
of
those
crown
witnesses
to
day
every
question
told
i
always
am
sound
am
i
not
i
don
t
gainsay
it
what
has
roughened
your
temper
put
some
punch
to
it
and
smooth
it
again
with
a
deprecatory
grunt
the
jackal
again
complied
the
old
sydney
carton
of
old
shrewsbury
school
said
stryver
nodding
his
head
over
him
as
he
reviewed
him
in
the
present
and
the
past
the
old
seesaw
sydney
up
one
minute
and
down
the
next
now
in
spirits
and
now
in
despondency
ah
returned
the
other
sighing
yes
the
same
sydney
with
the
same
luck
even
then
i
did
exercises
for
other
boys
and
seldom
did
my
own
and
why
not
god
knows
it
was
my
way
i
suppose
he
sat
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
legs
stretched
out
before
him
looking
at
the
fire
carton
said
his
friend
squaring
himself
at
him
with
a
bullying
air
as
if
the
fire
grate
had
been
the
furnace
in
which
sustained
endeavour
was
forged
and
the
one
delicate
thing
to
be
done
for
the
old
sydney
carton
of
old
shrewsbury
school
was
to
shoulder
him
into
it
your
way
is
and
always
was
a
lame
way
you
summon
no
energy
and
purpose
look
at
me
oh
botheration
returned
sydney
with
a
lighter
and
more
good
humoured
laugh
don
t
you
be
moral
how
have
i
done
what
i
have
done
said
stryver
how
do
i
do
what
i
do
partly
through
paying
me
to
help
you
i
suppose
but
it
s
not
worth
your
while
to
apostrophise
me
or
the
air
about
it
what
you
want
to
do
you
do
you
were
always
in
the
front
rank
and
i
was
always
behind
i
had
to
get
into
the
front
rank
i
was
not
born
there
was
i
i
was
not
present
at
the
ceremony
but
my
opinion
is
you
were
said
carton
at
this
he
laughed
again
and
they
both
laughed
before
shrewsbury
and
at
shrewsbury
and
ever
since
shrewsbury
pursued
carton
you
have
fallen
into
your
rank
and
i
have
fallen
into
mine
even
when
we
were
fellow
students
in
the
student
quarter
of
paris
picking
up
french
and
french
law
and
other
french
crumbs
that
we
didn
t
get
much
good
of
you
were
always
somewhere
and
i
was
always
nowhere
and
whose
fault
was
that
upon
my
soul
i
am
not
sure
that
it
was
not
yours
you
were
always
driving
and
riving
and
shouldering
and
passing
to
that
restless
degree
that
i
had
no
chance
for
my
life
but
in
rust
and
repose
it
s
a
gloomy
thing
however
to
talk
about
one
s
own
past
with
the
day
breaking
turn
me
in
some
other
direction
before
i
go
well
then
pledge
me
to
the
pretty
witness
said
stryver
holding
up
his
glass
are
you
turned
in
a
pleasant
direction
apparently
not
for
he
became
gloomy
again
pretty
witness
he
muttered
looking
down
into
his
glass
i
have
had
enough
of
witnesses
to
day
and
to
night
who
s
your
pretty
witness
the
picturesque
doctor
s
daughter
miss
manette
she
pretty
is
she
not
no
why
man
alive
she
was
the
admiration
of
the
whole
court
rot
the
admiration
of
the
whole
court
who
made
the
old
bailey
a
judge
of
beauty
she
was
a
golden
haired
doll
do
you
know
sydney
said
mr
stryver
looking
at
him
with
sharp
eyes
and
slowly
drawing
a
hand
across
his
florid
face
do
you
know
i
rather
thought
at
the
time
that
you
sympathised
with
the
golden
haired
doll
and
were
quick
to
see
what
happened
to
the
golden
haired
doll
quick
to
see
what
happened
if
a
girl
doll
or
no
doll
swoons
within
a
yard
or
two
of
a
man
s
nose
he
can
see
it
without
a
perspective
glass
i
pledge
you
but
i
deny
the
beauty
and
now
i
ll
have
no
more
drink
i
ll
get
to
bed
when
his
host
followed
him
out
on
the
staircase
with
a
candle
to
light
him
down
the
stairs
the
day
was
coldly
looking
in
through
its
grimy
windows
when
he
got
out
of
the
house
the
air
was
cold
and
sad
the
dull
sky
overcast
the
river
dark
and
dim
the
whole
scene
like
a
lifeless
desert
and
wreaths
of
dust
were
spinning
round
and
round
before
the
morning
blast
as
if
the
desert
sand
had
risen
far
away
and
the
first
spray
of
it
in
its
advance
had
begun
to
overwhelm
the
city
waste
forces
within
him
and
a
desert
all
around
this
man
stood
still
on
his
way
across
a
silent
terrace
and
saw
for
a
moment
lying
in
the
wilderness
before
him
a
mirage
of
honourable
ambition
self
denial
and
perseverance
in
the
fair
city
of
this
vision
there
were
airy
galleries
from
which
the
loves
and
graces
looked
upon
him
gardens
in
which
the
fruits
of
life
hung
ripening
waters
of
hope
that
sparkled
in
his
sight
a
moment
and
it
was
gone
climbing
to
a
high
chamber
in
a
well
of
houses
he
threw
himself
down
in
his
clothes
on
a
neglected
bed
and
its
pillow
was
wet
with
wasted
tears
sadly
sadly
the
sun
rose
it
rose
upon
no
sadder
sight
than
the
man
of
good
abilities
and
good
emotions
incapable
of
their
directed
exercise
incapable
of
his
own
help
and
his
own
happiness
sensible
of
the
blight
on
him
and
resigning
himself
to
let
it
eat
him
away
vi
hundreds
of
people
the
quiet
lodgings
of
doctor
manette
were
in
a
quiet
street
corner
not
far
from
soho
square
on
the
afternoon
of
a
certain
fine
sunday
when
the
waves
of
four
months
had
rolled
over
the
trial
for
treason
and
carried
it
as
to
the
public
interest
and
memory
far
out
to
sea
mr
jarvis
lorry
walked
along
the
sunny
streets
from
clerkenwell
where
he
lived
on
his
way
to
dine
with
the
doctor
after
several
relapses
into
business
absorption
mr
lorry
had
become
the
doctor
s
friend
and
the
quiet
street
corner
was
the
sunny
part
of
his
life
on
this
certain
fine
sunday
mr
lorry
walked
towards
soho
early
in
the
afternoon
for
three
reasons
of
habit
firstly
because
on
fine
sundays
he
often
walked
out
before
dinner
with
the
doctor
and
lucie
secondly
because
on
unfavourable
sundays
he
was
accustomed
to
be
with
them
as
the
family
friend
talking
reading
looking
out
of
window
and
generally
getting
through
the
day
thirdly
because
he
happened
to
have
his
own
little
shrewd
doubts
to
solve
and
knew
how
the
ways
of
the
doctor
s
household
pointed
to
that
time
as
a
likely
time
for
solving
them
a
quainter
corner
than
the
corner
where
the
doctor
lived
was
not
to
be
found
in
london
there
was
no
way
through
it
and
the
front
windows
of
the
doctor
s
lodgings
commanded
a
pleasant
little
vista
of
street
that
had
a
congenial
air
of
retirement
on
it
there
were
few
buildings
then
north
of
the
oxford
road
and
forest
trees
flourished
and
wild
flowers
grew
and
the
hawthorn
blossomed
in
the
now
vanished
fields
as
a
consequence
country
airs
circulated
in
soho
with
vigorous
freedom
instead
of
languishing
into
the
parish
like
stray
paupers
without
a
settlement
and
there
was
many
a
good
south
wall
not
far
off
on
which
the
peaches
ripened
in
their
season
the
summer
light
struck
into
the
corner
brilliantly
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
but
when
the
streets
grew
hot
the
corner
was
in
shadow
though
not
in
shadow
so
remote
but
that
you
could
see
beyond
it
into
a
glare
of
brightness
it
was
a
cool
spot
staid
but
cheerful
a
wonderful
place
for
echoes
and
a
very
harbour
from
the
raging
streets
there
ought
to
have
been
a
tranquil
bark
in
such
an
anchorage
and
there
was
the
doctor
occupied
two
floors
of
a
large
stiff
house
where
several
callings
purported
to
be
pursued
by
day
but
whereof
little
was
audible
any
day
and
which
was
shunned
by
all
of
them
at
night
in
a
building
at
the
back
attainable
by
a
courtyard
where
a
plane
tree
rustled
its
green
leaves
church
organs
claimed
to
be
made
and
silver
to
be
chased
and
likewise
gold
to
be
beaten
by
some
mysterious
giant
who
had
a
golden
arm
starting
out
of
the
wall
of
the
front
hall
as
if
he
had
beaten
himself
precious
and
menaced
a
similar
conversion
of
all
visitors
very
little
of
these
trades
or
of
a
lonely
lodger
rumoured
to
live
up
stairs
or
of
a
dim
coach
trimming
maker
asserted
to
have
a
counting
house
below
was
ever
heard
or
seen
occasionally
a
stray
workman
putting
his
coat
on
traversed
the
hall
or
a
stranger
peered
about
there
or
a
distant
clink
was
heard
across
the
courtyard
or
a
thump
from
the
golden
giant
these
however
were
only
the
exceptions
required
to
prove
the
rule
that
the
sparrows
in
the
plane
tree
behind
the
house
and
the
echoes
in
the
corner
before
it
had
their
own
way
from
sunday
morning
unto
saturday
night
doctor
manette
received
such
patients
here
as
his
old
reputation
and
its
revival
in
the
floating
whispers
of
his
story
brought
him
his
scientific
knowledge
and
his
vigilance
and
skill
in
conducting
ingenious
experiments
brought
him
otherwise
into
moderate
request
and
he
earned
as
much
as
he
wanted
these
things
were
within
mr
jarvis
lorry
s
knowledge
thoughts
and
notice
when
he
rang
the
door
bell
of
the
tranquil
house
in
the
corner
on
the
fine
sunday
afternoon
doctor
manette
at
home
expected
home
miss
lucie
at
home
expected
home
miss
pross
at
home
possibly
at
home
but
of
a
certainty
impossible
for
handmaid
to
anticipate
intentions
of
miss
pross
as
to
admission
or
denial
of
the
fact
as
i
am
at
home
myself
said
mr
lorry
i
ll
go
upstairs
although
the
doctor
s
daughter
had
known
nothing
of
the
country
of
her
birth
she
appeared
to
have
innately
derived
from
it
that
ability
to
make
much
of
little
means
which
is
one
of
its
most
useful
and
most
agreeable
characteristics
simple
as
the
furniture
was
it
was
set
off
by
so
many
little
adornments
of
no
value
but
for
their
taste
and
fancy
that
its
effect
was
delightful
the
disposition
of
everything
in
the
rooms
from
the
largest
object
to
the
least
the
arrangement
of
colours
the
elegant
variety
and
contrast
obtained
by
thrift
in
trifles
by
delicate
hands
clear
eyes
and
good
sense
were
at
once
so
pleasant
in
themselves
and
so
expressive
of
their
originator
that
as
mr
lorry
stood
looking
about
him
the
very
chairs
and
tables
seemed
to
ask
him
with
something
of
that
peculiar
expression
which
he
knew
so
well
by
this
time
whether
he
approved
there
were
three
rooms
on
a
floor
and
the
doors
by
which
they
communicated
being
put
open
that
the
air
might
pass
freely
through
them
all
mr
lorry
smilingly
observant
of
that
fanciful
resemblance
which
he
detected
all
around
him
walked
from
one
to
another
the
first
was
the
best
room
and
in
it
were
lucie
s
birds
and
flowers
and
books
and
desk
and
work
table
and
box
of
water
colours
the
second
was
the
doctor
s
consulting
room
used
also
as
the
dining
room
the
third
changingly
speckled
by
the
rustle
of
the
plane
tree
in
the
yard
was
the
doctor
s
bedroom
and
there
in
a
corner
stood
the
disused
shoemaker
s
bench
and
tray
of
tools
much
as
it
had
stood
on
the
fifth
floor
of
the
dismal
house
by
the
wine
shop
in
the
suburb
of
saint
antoine
in
paris
i
wonder
said
mr
lorry
pausing
in
his
looking
about
that
he
keeps
that
reminder
of
his
sufferings
about
him
and
why
wonder
at
that
was
the
abrupt
inquiry
that
made
him
start
it
proceeded
from
miss
pross
the
wild
red
woman
strong
of
hand
whose
acquaintance
he
had
first
made
at
the
royal
george
hotel
at
dover
and
had
since
improved
i
should
have
thought
mr
lorry
began
pooh
you
d
have
thought
said
miss
pross
and
mr
lorry
left
off
how
do
you
do
inquired
that
lady
then
sharply
and
yet
as
if
to
express
that
she
bore
him
no
malice
i
am
pretty
well
i
thank
you
answered
mr
lorry
with
meekness
how
are
you
nothing
to
boast
of
said
miss
pross
indeed
ah
indeed
said
miss
pross
i
am
very
much
put
out
about
my
ladybird
indeed
for
gracious
sake
say
something
else
besides
indeed
or
you
ll
fidget
me
to
death
said
miss
pross
whose
character
dissociated
from
stature
was
shortness
really
then
said
mr
lorry
as
an
amendment
really
is
bad
enough
returned
miss
pross
but
better
yes
i
am
very
much
put
out
may
i
ask
the
cause
i
don
t
want
dozens
of
people
who
are
not
at
all
worthy
of
ladybird
to
come
here
looking
after
her
said
miss
pross
do
dozens
come
for
that
purpose
hundreds
said
miss
pross
it
was
characteristic
of
this
lady
as
of
some
other
people
before
her
time
and
since
that
whenever
her
original
proposition
was
questioned
she
exaggerated
it
dear
me
said
mr
lorry
as
the
safest
remark
he
could
think
of
i
have
lived
with
the
darling
or
the
darling
has
lived
with
me
and
paid
me
for
it
which
she
certainly
should
never
have
done
you
may
take
your
affidavit
if
i
could
have
afforded
to
keep
either
myself
or
her
for
nothing
since
she
was
ten
years
old
and
it
s
really
very
hard
said
miss
pross
not
seeing
with
precision
what
was
very
hard
mr
lorry
shook
his
head
using
that
important
part
of
himself
as
a
sort
of
fairy
cloak
that
would
fit
anything
all
sorts
of
people
who
are
not
in
the
least
degree
worthy
of
the
pet
are
always
turning
up
said
miss
pross
when
you
began
it
i
began
it
miss
pross
didn
t
you
who
brought
her
father
to
life
oh
if
that
was
beginning
it
said
mr
lorry
it
wasn
t
ending
it
i
suppose
i
say
when
you
began
it
it
was
hard
enough
not
that
i
have
any
fault
to
find
with
doctor
manette
except
that
he
is
not
worthy
of
such
a
daughter
which
is
no
imputation
on
him
for
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
anybody
should
be
under
any
circumstances
but
it
really
is
doubly
and
trebly
hard
to
have
crowds
and
multitudes
of
people
turning
up
after
him
i
could
have
forgiven
him
to
take
ladybird
s
affections
away
from
me
mr
lorry
knew
miss
pross
to
be
very
jealous
but
he
also
knew
her
by
this
time
to
be
beneath
the
service
of
her
eccentricity
one
of
those
unselfish
creatures
found
only
among
women
who
will
for
pure
love
and
admiration
bind
themselves
willing
slaves
to
youth
when
they
have
lost
it
to
beauty
that
they
never
had
to
accomplishments
that
they
were
never
fortunate
enough
to
gain
to
bright
hopes
that
never
shone
upon
their
own
sombre
lives
he
knew
enough
of
the
world
to
know
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
better
than
the
faithful
service
of
the
heart
so
rendered
and
so
free
from
any
mercenary
taint
he
had
such
an
exalted
respect
for
it
that
in
the
retributive
arrangements
made
by
his
own
mind
we
all
make
such
arrangements
more
or
less
he
stationed
miss
pross
much
nearer
to
the
lower
angels
than
many
ladies
immeasurably
better
got
up
both
by
nature
and
art
who
had
balances
at
tellson
s
there
never
was
nor
will
be
but
one
man
worthy
of
ladybird
said
miss
pross
and
that
was
my
brother
solomon
if
he
hadn
t
made
a
mistake
in
life
here
again
mr
lorry
s
inquiries
into
miss
pross
s
personal
history
had
established
the
fact
that
her
brother
solomon
was
a
heartless
scoundrel
who
had
stripped
her
of
everything
she
possessed
as
a
stake
to
speculate
with
and
had
abandoned
her
in
her
poverty
for
evermore
with
no
touch
of
compunction
miss
pross
s
fidelity
of
belief
in
solomon
deducting
a
mere
trifle
for
this
slight
mistake
was
quite
a
serious
matter
with
mr
lorry
and
had
its
weight
in
his
good
opinion
of
her
as
we
happen
to
be
alone
for
the
moment
and
are
both
people
of
business
he
said
when
they
had
got
back
to
the
drawing
room
and
had
sat
down
there
in
friendly
relations
let
me
ask
you
does
the
doctor
in
talking
with
lucie
never
refer
to
the
shoemaking
time
yet
never
and
yet
keeps
that
bench
and
those
tools
beside
him
ah
returned
miss
pross
shaking
her
head
but
i
don
t
say
he
don
t
refer
to
it
within
himself
do
you
believe
that
he
thinks
of
it
much
i
do
said
miss
pross
do
you
imagine
mr
lorry
had
begun
when
miss
pross
took
him
up
short
with
never
imagine
anything
have
no
imagination
at
all
i
stand
corrected
do
you
suppose
you
go
so
far
as
to
suppose
sometimes
now
and
then
said
miss
pross
do
you
suppose
mr
lorry
went
on
with
a
laughing
twinkle
in
his
bright
eye
as
it
looked
kindly
at
her
that
doctor
manette
has
any
theory
of
his
own
preserved
through
all
those
years
relative
to
the
cause
of
his
being
so
oppressed
perhaps
even
to
the
name
of
his
oppressor
i
don
t
suppose
anything
about
it
but
what
ladybird
tells
me
and
that
is
that
she
thinks
he
has
now
don
t
be
angry
at
my
asking
all
these
questions
because
i
am
a
mere
dull
man
of
business
and
you
are
a
woman
of
business
dull
miss
pross
inquired
with
placidity
rather
wishing
his
modest
adjective
away
mr
lorry
replied
no
no
no
surely
not
to
return
to
business
is
it
not
remarkable
that
doctor
manette
unquestionably
innocent
of
any
crime
as
we
are
all
well
assured
he
is
should
never
touch
upon
that
question
i
will
not
say
with
me
though
he
had
business
relations
with
me
many
years
ago
and
we
are
now
intimate
i
will
say
with
the
fair
daughter
to
whom
he
is
so
devotedly
attached
and
who
is
so
devotedly
attached
to
him
believe
me
miss
pross
i
don
t
approach
the
topic
with
you
out
of
curiosity
but
out
of
zealous
interest
well
to
the
best
of
my
understanding
and
bad
s
the
best
you
ll
tell
me
said
miss
pross
softened
by
the
tone
of
the
apology
he
is
afraid
of
the
whole
subject
afraid
it
s
plain
enough
i
should
think
why
he
may
be
it
s
a
dreadful
remembrance
besides
that
his
loss
of
himself
grew
out
of
it
not
knowing
how
he
lost
himself
or
how
he
recovered
himself
he
may
never
feel
certain
of
not
losing
himself
again
that
alone
wouldn
t
make
the
subject
pleasant
i
should
think
it
was
a
profounder
remark
than
mr
lorry
had
looked
for
true
said
he
and
fearful
to
reflect
upon
yet
a
doubt
lurks
in
my
mind
miss
pross
whether
it
is
good
for
doctor
manette
to
have
that
suppression
always
shut
up
within
him
indeed
it
is
this
doubt
and
the
uneasiness
it
sometimes
causes
me
that
has
led
me
to
our
present
confidence
can
t
be
helped
said
miss
pross
shaking
her
head
touch
that
string
and
he
instantly
changes
for
the
worse
better
leave
it
alone
in
short
must
leave
it
alone
like
or
no
like
sometimes
he
gets
up
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
will
be
heard
by
us
overhead
there
walking
up
and
down
walking
up
and
down
in
his
room
ladybird
has
learnt
to
know
then
that
his
mind
is
walking
up
and
down
walking
up
and
down
in
his
old
prison
she
hurries
to
him
and
they
go
on
together
walking
up
and
down
walking
up
and
down
until
he
is
composed
but
he
never
says
a
word
of
the
true
reason
of
his
restlessness
to
her
and
she
finds
it
best
not
to
hint
at
it
to
him
in
silence
they
go
walking
up
and
down
together
walking
up
and
down
together
till
her
love
and
company
have
brought
him
to
himself
notwithstanding
miss
pross
s
denial
of
her
own
imagination
there
was
a
perception
of
the
pain
of
being
monotonously
haunted
by
one
sad
idea
in
her
repetition
of
the
phrase
walking
up
and
down
which
testified
to
her
possessing
such
a
thing
the
corner
has
been
mentioned
as
a
wonderful
corner
for
echoes
it
had
begun
to
echo
so
resoundingly
to
the
tread
of
coming
feet
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
very
mention
of
that
weary
pacing
to
and
fro
had
set
it
going
here
they
are
said
miss
pross
rising
to
break
up
the
conference
and
now
we
shall
have
hundreds
of
people
pretty
soon
it
was
such
a
curious
corner
in
its
acoustical
properties
such
a
peculiar
ear
of
a
place
that
as
mr
lorry
stood
at
the
open
window
looking
for
the
father
and
daughter
whose
steps
he
heard
he
fancied
they
would
never
approach
not
only
would
the
echoes
die
away
as
though
the
steps
had
gone
but
echoes
of
other
steps
that
never
came
would
be
heard
in
their
stead
and
would
die
away
for
good
when
they
seemed
close
at
hand
however
father
and
daughter
did
at
last
appear
and
miss
pross
was
ready
at
the
street
door
to
receive
them
miss
pross
was
a
pleasant
sight
albeit
wild
and
red
and
grim
taking
off
her
darling
s
bonnet
when
she
came
up
stairs
and
touching
it
up
with
the
ends
of
her
handkerchief
and
blowing
the
dust
off
it
and
folding
her
mantle
ready
for
laying
by
and
smoothing
her
rich
hair
with
as
much
pride
as
she
could
possibly
have
taken
in
her
own
hair
if
she
had
been
the
vainest
and
handsomest
of
women
her
darling
was
a
pleasant
sight
too
embracing
her
and
thanking
her
and
protesting
against
her
taking
so
much
trouble
for
her
which
last
she
only
dared
to
do
playfully
or
miss
pross
sorely
hurt
would
have
retired
to
her
own
chamber
and
cried
the
doctor
was
a
pleasant
sight
too
looking
on
at
them
and
telling
miss
pross
how
she
spoilt
lucie
in
accents
and
with
eyes
that
had
as
much
spoiling
in
them
as
miss
pross
had
and
would
have
had
more
if
it
were
possible
mr
lorry
was
a
pleasant
sight
too
beaming
at
all
this
in
his
little
wig
and
thanking
his
bachelor
stars
for
having
lighted
him
in
his
declining
years
to
a
home
but
no
hundreds
of
people
came
to
see
the
sights
and
mr
lorry
looked
in
vain
for
the
fulfilment
of
miss
pross
s
prediction
dinner
time
and
still
no
hundreds
of
people
in
the
arrangements
of
the
little
household
miss
pross
took
charge
of
the
lower
regions
and
always
acquitted
herself
marvellously
her
dinners
of
a
very
modest
quality
were
so
well
cooked
and
so
well
served
and
so
neat
in
their
contrivances
half
english
and
half
french
that
nothing
could
be
better
miss
pross
s
friendship
being
of
the
thoroughly
practical
kind
she
had
ravaged
soho
and
the
adjacent
provinces
in
search
of
impoverished
french
who
tempted
by
shillings
and
half
crowns
would
impart
culinary
mysteries
to
her
from
these
decayed
sons
and
daughters
of
gaul
she
had
acquired
such
wonderful
arts
that
the
woman
and
girl
who
formed
the
staff
of
domestics
regarded
her
as
quite
a
sorceress
or
cinderella
s
godmother
who
would
send
out
for
a
fowl
a
rabbit
a
vegetable
or
two
from
the
garden
and
change
them
into
anything
she
pleased
on
sundays
miss
pross
dined
at
the
doctor
s
table
but
on
other
days
persisted
in
taking
her
meals
at
unknown
periods
either
in
the
lower
regions
or
in
her
own
room
on
the
second
floor
a
blue
chamber
to
which
no
one
but
her
ladybird
ever
gained
admittance
on
this
occasion
miss
pross
responding
to
ladybird
s
pleasant
face
and
pleasant
efforts
to
please
her
unbent
exceedingly
so
the
dinner
was
very
pleasant
too
it
was
an
oppressive
day
and
after
dinner
lucie
proposed
that
the
wine
should
be
carried
out
under
the
plane
tree
and
they
should
sit
there
in
the
air
as
everything
turned
upon
her
and
revolved
about
her
they
went
out
under
the
plane
tree
and
she
carried
the
wine
down
for
the
special
benefit
of
mr
lorry
she
had
installed
herself
some
time
before
as
mr
lorry
s
cup
bearer
and
while
they
sat
under
the
plane
tree
talking
she
kept
his
glass
replenished
mysterious
backs
and
ends
of
houses
peeped
at
them
as
they
talked
and
the
plane
tree
whispered
to
them
in
its
own
way
above
their
heads
still
the
hundreds
of
people
did
not
present
themselves
mr
darnay
presented
himself
while
they
were
sitting
under
the
plane
tree
but
he
was
only
one
doctor
manette
received
him
kindly
and
so
did
lucie
but
miss
pross
suddenly
became
afflicted
with
a
twitching
in
the
head
and
body
and
retired
into
the
house
she
was
not
unfrequently
the
victim
of
this
disorder
and
she
called
it
in
familiar
conversation
a
fit
of
the
jerks
the
doctor
was
in
his
best
condition
and
looked
specially
young
the
resemblance
between
him
and
lucie
was
very
strong
at
such
times
and
as
they
sat
side
by
side
she
leaning
on
his
shoulder
and
he
resting
his
arm
on
the
back
of
her
chair
it
was
very
agreeable
to
trace
the
likeness
he
had
been
talking
all
day
on
many
subjects
and
with
unusual
vivacity
pray
doctor
manette
said
mr
darnay
as
they
sat
under
the
plane
tree
and
he
said
it
in
the
natural
pursuit
of
the
topic
in
hand
which
happened
to
be
the
old
buildings
of
london
have
you
seen
much
of
the
tower
lucie
and
i
have
been
there
but
only
casually
we
have
seen
enough
of
it
to
know
that
it
teems
with
interest
little
more
i
have
been
there
as
you
remember
said
darnay
with
a
smile
though
reddening
a
little
angrily
in
another
character
and
not
in
a
character
that
gives
facilities
for
seeing
much
of
it
they
told
me
a
curious
thing
when
i
was
there
what
was
that
lucie
asked
in
making
some
alterations
the
workmen
came
upon
an
old
dungeon
which
had
been
for
many
years
built
up
and
forgotten
every
stone
of
its
inner
wall
was
covered
by
inscriptions
which
had
been
carved
by
prisoners
dates
names
complaints
and
prayers
upon
a
corner
stone
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
one
prisoner
who
seemed
to
have
gone
to
execution
had
cut
as
his
last
work
three
letters
they
were
done
with
some
very
poor
instrument
and
hurriedly
with
an
unsteady
hand
at
first
they
were
read
as
d
i
c
but
on
being
more
carefully
examined
the
last
letter
was
found
to
be
g
there
was
no
record
or
legend
of
any
prisoner
with
those
initials
and
many
fruitless
guesses
were
made
what
the
name
could
have
been
at
length
it
was
suggested
that
the
letters
were
not
initials
but
the
complete
word
dig
the
floor
was
examined
very
carefully
under
the
inscription
and
in
the
earth
beneath
a
stone
or
tile
or
some
fragment
of
paving
were
found
the
ashes
of
a
paper
mingled
with
the
ashes
of
a
small
leathern
case
or
bag
what
the
unknown
prisoner
had
written
will
never
be
read
but
he
had
written
something
and
hidden
it
away
to
keep
it
from
the
gaoler
my
father
exclaimed
lucie
you
are
ill
he
had
suddenly
started
up
with
his
hand
to
his
head
his
manner
and
his
look
quite
terrified
them
all
no
my
dear
not
ill
there
are
large
drops
of
rain
falling
and
they
made
me
start
we
had
better
go
in
he
recovered
himself
almost
instantly
rain
was
really
falling
in
large
drops
and
he
showed
the
back
of
his
hand
with
rain
drops
on
it
but
he
said
not
a
single
word
in
reference
to
the
discovery
that
had
been
told
of
and
as
they
went
into
the
house
the
business
eye
of
mr
lorry
either
detected
or
fancied
it
detected
on
his
face
as
it
turned
towards
charles
darnay
the
same
singular
look
that
had
been
upon
it
when
it
turned
towards
him
in
the
passages
of
the
court
house
he
recovered
himself
so
quickly
however
that
mr
lorry
had
doubts
of
his
business
eye
the
arm
of
the
golden
giant
in
the
hall
was
not
more
steady
than
he
was
when
he
stopped
under
it
to
remark
to
them
that
he
was
not
yet
proof
against
slight
surprises
if
he
ever
would
be
and
that
the
rain
had
startled
him
tea
time
and
miss
pross
making
tea
with
another
fit
of
the
jerks
upon
her
and
yet
no
hundreds
of
people
mr
carton
had
lounged
in
but
he
made
only
two
the
night
was
so
very
sultry
that
although
they
sat
with
doors
and
windows
open
they
were
overpowered
by
heat
when
the
tea
table
was
done
with
they
all
moved
to
one
of
the
windows
and
looked
out
into
the
heavy
twilight
lucie
sat
by
her
father
darnay
sat
beside
her
carton
leaned
against
a
window
the
curtains
were
long
and
white
and
some
of
the
thunder
gusts
that
whirled
into
the
corner
caught
them
up
to
the
ceiling
and
waved
them
like
spectral
wings
the
rain
drops
are
still
falling
large
heavy
and
few
said
doctor
manette
it
comes
slowly
it
comes
surely
said
carton
they
spoke
low
as
people
watching
and
waiting
mostly
do
as
people
in
a
dark
room
watching
and
waiting
for
lightning
always
do
there
was
a
great
hurry
in
the
streets
of
people
speeding
away
to
get
shelter
before
the
storm
broke
the
wonderful
corner
for
echoes
resounded
with
the
echoes
of
footsteps
coming
and
going
yet
not
a
footstep
was
there
a
multitude
of
people
and
yet
a
solitude
said
darnay
when
they
had
listened
for
a
while
is
it
not
impressive
mr
darnay
asked
lucie
sometimes
i
have
sat
here
of
an
evening
until
i
have
fancied
but
even
the
shade
of
a
foolish
fancy
makes
me
shudder
to
night
when
all
is
so
black
and
solemn
let
us
shudder
too
we
may
know
what
it
is
it
will
seem
nothing
to
you
such
whims
are
only
impressive
as
we
originate
them
i
think
they
are
not
to
be
communicated
i
have
sometimes
sat
alone
here
of
an
evening
listening
until
i
have
made
the
echoes
out
to
be
the
echoes
of
all
the
footsteps
that
are
coming
by
and
bye
into
our
lives
there
is
a
great
crowd
coming
one
day
into
our
lives
if
that
be
so
sydney
carton
struck
in
in
his
moody
way
the
footsteps
were
incessant
and
the
hurry
of
them
became
more
and
more
rapid
the
corner
echoed
and
re
echoed
with
the
tread
of
feet
some
as
it
seemed
under
the
windows
some
as
it
seemed
in
the
room
some
coming
some
going
some
breaking
off
some
stopping
altogether
all
in
the
distant
streets
and
not
one
within
sight
are
all
these
footsteps
destined
to
come
to
all
of
us
miss
manette
or
are
we
to
divide
them
among
us
i
don
t
know
mr
darnay
i
told
you
it
was
a
foolish
fancy
but
you
asked
for
it
when
i
have
yielded
myself
to
it
i
have
been
alone
and
then
i
have
imagined
them
the
footsteps
of
the
people
who
are
to
come
into
my
life
and
my
father
s
i
take
them
into
mine
said
carton
i
ask
no
questions
and
make
no
stipulations
there
is
a
great
crowd
bearing
down
upon
us
miss
manette
and
i
see
them
by
the
lightning
he
added
the
last
words
after
there
had
been
a
vivid
flash
which
had
shown
him
lounging
in
the
window
and
i
hear
them
he
added
again
after
a
peal
of
thunder
here
they
come
fast
fierce
and
furious
it
was
the
rush
and
roar
of
rain
that
he
typified
and
it
stopped
him
for
no
voice
could
be
heard
in
it
a
memorable
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
broke
with
that
sweep
of
water
and
there
was
not
a
moment
s
interval
in
crash
and
fire
and
rain
until
after
the
moon
rose
at
midnight
the
great
bell
of
saint
paul
s
was
striking
one
in
the
cleared
air
when
mr
lorry
escorted
by
jerry
high
booted
and
bearing
a
lantern
set
forth
on
his
return
passage
to
clerkenwell
there
were
solitary
patches
of
road
on
the
way
between
soho
and
clerkenwell
and
mr
lorry
mindful
of
foot
pads
always
retained
jerry
for
this
service
though
it
was
usually
performed
a
good
two
hours
earlier
what
a
night
it
has
been
almost
a
night
jerry
said
mr
lorry
to
bring
the
dead
out
of
their
graves
i
never
see
the
night
myself
master
nor
yet
i
don
t
expect
to
what
would
do
that
answered
jerry
good
night
mr
carton
said
the
man
of
business
good
night
mr
darnay
shall
we
ever
see
such
a
night
again
together
perhaps
perhaps
see
the
great
crowd
of
people
with
its
rush
and
roar
bearing
down
upon
them
too
vii
monseigneur
in
town
monseigneur
one
of
the
great
lords
in
power
at
the
court
held
his
fortnightly
reception
in
his
grand
hotel
in
paris
monseigneur
was
in
his
inner
room
his
sanctuary
of
sanctuaries
the
holiest
of
holiests
to
the
crowd
of
worshippers
in
the
suite
of
rooms
without
monseigneur
was
about
to
take
his
chocolate
monseigneur
could
swallow
a
great
many
things
with
ease
and
was
by
some
few
sullen
minds
supposed
to
be
rather
rapidly
swallowing
france
but
his
morning
s
chocolate
could
not
so
much
as
get
into
the
throat
of
monseigneur
without
the
aid
of
four
strong
men
besides
the
cook
yes
it
took
four
men
all
four
ablaze
with
gorgeous
decoration
and
the
chief
of
them
unable
to
exist
with
fewer
than
two
gold
watches
in
his
pocket
emulative
of
the
noble
and
chaste
fashion
set
by
monseigneur
to
conduct
the
happy
chocolate
to
monseigneur
s
lips
one
lacquey
carried
the
chocolate
pot
into
the
sacred
presence
a
second
milled
and
frothed
the
chocolate
with
the
little
instrument
he
bore
for
that
function
a
third
presented
the
favoured
napkin
a
fourth
he
of
the
two
gold
watches
poured
the
chocolate
out
it
was
impossible
for
monseigneur
to
dispense
with
one
of
these
attendants
on
the
chocolate
and
hold
his
high
place
under
the
admiring
heavens
deep
would
have
been
the
blot
upon
his
escutcheon
if
his
chocolate
had
been
ignobly
waited
on
by
only
three
men
he
must
have
died
of
two
monseigneur
had
been
out
at
a
little
supper
last
night
where
the
comedy
and
the
grand
opera
were
charmingly
represented
monseigneur
was
out
at
a
little
supper
most
nights
with
fascinating
company
so
polite
and
so
impressible
was
monseigneur
that
the
comedy
and
the
grand
opera
had
far
more
influence
with
him
in
the
tiresome
articles
of
state
affairs
and
state
secrets
than
the
needs
of
all
france
a
happy
circumstance
for
france
as
the
like
always
is
for
all
countries
similarly
favoured
always
was
for
england
by
way
of
example
in
the
regretted
days
of
the
merry
stuart
who
sold
it
monseigneur
had
one
truly
noble
idea
of
general
public
business
which
was
to
let
everything
go
on
in
its
own
way
of
particular
public
business
monseigneur
had
the
other
truly
noble
idea
that
it
must
all
go
his
way
tend
to
his
own
power
and
pocket
of
his
pleasures
general
and
particular
monseigneur
had
the
other
truly
noble
idea
that
the
world
was
made
for
them
the
text
of
his
order
altered
from
the
original
by
only
a
pronoun
which
is
not
much
ran
the
earth
and
the
fulness
thereof
are
mine
saith
monseigneur
yet
monseigneur
had
slowly
found
that
vulgar
embarrassments
crept
into
his
affairs
both
private
and
public
and
he
had
as
to
both
classes
of
affairs
allied
himself
perforce
with
a
farmer
general
as
to
finances
public
because
monseigneur
could
not
make
anything
at
all
of
them
and
must
consequently
let
them
out
to
somebody
who
could
as
to
finances
private
because
farmer
generals
were
rich
and
monseigneur
after
generations
of
great
luxury
and
expense
was
growing
poor
hence
monseigneur
had
taken
his
sister
from
a
convent
while
there
was
yet
time
to
ward
off
the
impending
veil
the
cheapest
garment
she
could
wear
and
had
bestowed
her
as
a
prize
upon
a
very
rich
farmer
general
poor
in
family
which
farmer
general
carrying
an
appropriate
cane
with
a
golden
apple
on
the
top
of
it
was
now
among
the
company
in
the
outer
rooms
much
prostrated
before
by
mankind
always
excepting
superior
mankind
of
the
blood
of
monseigneur
who
his
own
wife
included
looked
down
upon
him
with
the
loftiest
contempt
a
sumptuous
man
was
the
farmer
general
thirty
horses
stood
in
his
stables
twenty
four
male
domestics
sat
in
his
halls
six
body
women
waited
on
his
wife
as
one
who
pretended
to
do
nothing
but
plunder
and
forage
where
he
could
the
farmer
general
howsoever
his
matrimonial
relations
conduced
to
social
morality
was
at
least
the
greatest
reality
among
the
personages
who
attended
at
the
hotel
of
monseigneur
that
day
for
the
rooms
though
a
beautiful
scene
to
look
at
and
adorned
with
every
device
of
decoration
that
the
taste
and
skill
of
the
time
could
achieve
were
in
truth
not
a
sound
business
considered
with
any
reference
to
the
scarecrows
in
the
rags
and
nightcaps
elsewhere
and
not
so
far
off
either
but
that
the
watching
towers
of
notre
dame
almost
equidistant
from
the
two
extremes
could
see
them
both
they
would
have
been
an
exceedingly
uncomfortable
business
if
that
could
have
been
anybody
s
business
at
the
house
of
monseigneur
military
officers
destitute
of
military
knowledge
naval
officers
with
no
idea
of
a
ship
civil
officers
without
a
notion
of
affairs
brazen
ecclesiastics
of
the
worst
world
worldly
with
sensual
eyes
loose
tongues
and
looser
lives
all
totally
unfit
for
their
several
callings
all
lying
horribly
in
pretending
to
belong
to
them
but
all
nearly
or
remotely
of
the
order
of
monseigneur
and
therefore
foisted
on
all
public
employments
from
which
anything
was
to
be
got
these
were
to
be
told
off
by
the
score
and
the
score
people
not
immediately
connected
with
monseigneur
or
the
state
yet
equally
unconnected
with
anything
that
was
real
or
with
lives
passed
in
travelling
by
any
straight
road
to
any
true
earthly
end
were
no
less
abundant
doctors
who
made
great
fortunes
out
of
dainty
remedies
for
imaginary
disorders
that
never
existed
smiled
upon
their
courtly
patients
in
the
ante
chambers
of
monseigneur
projectors
who
had
discovered
every
kind
of
remedy
for
the
little
evils
with
which
the
state
was
touched
except
the
remedy
of
setting
to
work
in
earnest
to
root
out
a
single
sin
poured
their
distracting
babble
into
any
ears
they
could
lay
hold
of
at
the
reception
of
monseigneur
unbelieving
philosophers
who
were
remodelling
the
world
with
words
and
making
card
towers
of
babel
to
scale
the
skies
with
talked
with
unbelieving
chemists
who
had
an
eye
on
the
transmutation
of
metals
at
this
wonderful
gathering
accumulated
by
monseigneur
exquisite
gentlemen
of
the
finest
breeding
which
was
at
that
remarkable
time
and
has
been
since
to
be
known
by
its
fruits
of
indifference
to
every
natural
subject
of
human
interest
were
in
the
most
exemplary
state
of
exhaustion
at
the
hotel
of
monseigneur
such
homes
had
these
various
notabilities
left
behind
them
in
the
fine
world
of
paris
that
the
spies
among
the
assembled
devotees
of
monseigneur
forming
a
goodly
half
of
the
polite
company
would
have
found
it
hard
to
discover
among
the
angels
of
that
sphere
one
solitary
wife
who
in
her
manners
and
appearance
owned
to
being
a
mother
indeed
except
for
the
mere
act
of
bringing
a
troublesome
creature
into
this
world
which
does
not
go
far
towards
the
realisation
of
the
name
of
mother
there
was
no
such
thing
known
to
the
fashion
peasant
women
kept
the
unfashionable
babies
close
and
brought
them
up
and
charming
grandmammas
of
sixty
dressed
and
supped
as
at
twenty
the
leprosy
of
unreality
disfigured
every
human
creature
in
attendance
upon
monseigneur
in
the
outermost
room
were
half
a
dozen
exceptional
people
who
had
had
for
a
few
years
some
vague
misgiving
in
them
that
things
in
general
were
going
rather
wrong
as
a
promising
way
of
setting
them
right
half
of
the
half
dozen
had
become
members
of
a
fantastic
sect
of
convulsionists
and
were
even
then
considering
within
themselves
whether
they
should
foam
rage
roar
and
turn
cataleptic
on
the
spot
thereby
setting
up
a
highly
intelligible
finger
post
to
the
future
for
monseigneur
s
guidance
besides
these
dervishes
were
other
three
who
had
rushed
into
another
sect
which
mended
matters
with
a
jargon
about
the
centre
of
truth
holding
that
man
had
got
out
of
the
centre
of
truth
which
did
not
need
much
demonstration
but
had
not
got
out
of
the
circumference
and
that
he
was
to
be
kept
from
flying
out
of
the
circumference
and
was
even
to
be
shoved
back
into
the
centre
by
fasting
and
seeing
of
spirits
among
these
accordingly
much
discoursing
with
spirits
went
on
and
it
did
a
world
of
good
which
never
became
manifest
but
the
comfort
was
that
all
the
company
at
the
grand
hotel
of
monseigneur
were
perfectly
dressed
if
the
day
of
judgment
had
only
been
ascertained
to
be
a
dress
day
everybody
there
would
have
been
eternally
correct
such
frizzling
and
powdering
and
sticking
up
of
hair
such
delicate
complexions
artificially
preserved
and
mended
such
gallant
swords
to
look
at
and
such
delicate
honour
to
the
sense
of
smell
would
surely
keep
anything
going
for
ever
and
ever
the
exquisite
gentlemen
of
the
finest
breeding
wore
little
pendent
trinkets
that
chinked
as
they
languidly
moved
these
golden
fetters
rang
like
precious
little
bells
and
what
with
that
ringing
and
with
the
rustle
of
silk
and
brocade
and
fine
linen
there
was
a
flutter
in
the
air
that
fanned
saint
antoine
and
his
devouring
hunger
far
away
dress
was
the
one
unfailing
talisman
and
charm
used
for
keeping
all
things
in
their
places
everybody
was
dressed
for
a
fancy
ball
that
was
never
to
leave
off
from
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
through
monseigneur
and
the
whole
court
through
the
chambers
the
tribunals
of
justice
and
all
society
except
the
scarecrows
the
fancy
ball
descended
to
the
common
executioner
who
in
pursuance
of
the
charm
was
required
to
officiate
frizzled
powdered
in
a
gold
laced
coat
pumps
and
white
silk
stockings
at
the
gallows
and
the
wheel
the
axe
was
a
rarity
monsieur
paris
as
it
was
the
episcopal
mode
among
his
brother
professors
of
the
provinces
monsieur
orleans
and
the
rest
to
call
him
presided
in
this
dainty
dress
and
who
among
the
company
at
monseigneur
s
reception
in
that
seventeen
hundred
and
eightieth
year
of
our
lord
could
possibly
doubt
that
a
system
rooted
in
a
frizzled
hangman
powdered
gold
laced
pumped
and
white
silk
stockinged
would
see
the
very
stars
out
monseigneur
having
eased
his
four
men
of
their
burdens
and
taken
his
chocolate
caused
the
doors
of
the
holiest
of
holiests
to
be
thrown
open
and
issued
forth
then
what
submission
what
cringing
and
fawning
what
servility
what
abject
humiliation
as
to
bowing
down
in
body
and
spirit
nothing
in
that
way
was
left
for
heaven
which
may
have
been
one
among
other
reasons
why
the
worshippers
of
monseigneur
never
troubled
it
bestowing
a
word
of
promise
here
and
a
smile
there
a
whisper
on
one
happy
slave
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
on
another
monseigneur
affably
passed
through
his
rooms
to
the
remote
region
of
the
circumference
of
truth
there
monseigneur
turned
and
came
back
again
and
so
in
due
course
of
time
got
himself
shut
up
in
his
sanctuary
by
the
chocolate
sprites
and
was
seen
no
more
the
show
being
over
the
flutter
in
the
air
became
quite
a
little
storm
and
the
precious
little
bells
went
ringing
downstairs
there
was
soon
but
one
person
left
of
all
the
crowd
and
he
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
his
snuff
box
in
his
hand
slowly
passed
among
the
mirrors
on
his
way
out
i
devote
you
said
this
person
stopping
at
the
last
door
on
his
way
and
turning
in
the
direction
of
the
sanctuary
to
the
devil
with
that
he
shook
the
snuff
from
his
fingers
as
if
he
had
shaken
the
dust
from
his
feet
and
quietly
walked
downstairs
he
was
a
man
of
about
sixty
handsomely
dressed
haughty
in
manner
and
with
a
face
like
a
fine
mask
a
face
of
a
transparent
paleness
every
feature
in
it
clearly
defined
one
set
expression
on
it
the
nose
beautifully
formed
otherwise
was
very
slightly
pinched
at
the
top
of
each
nostril
in
those
two
compressions
or
dints
the
only
little
change
that
the
face
ever
showed
resided
they
persisted
in
changing
colour
sometimes
and
they
would
be
occasionally
dilated
and
contracted
by
something
like
a
faint
pulsation
then
they
gave
a
look
of
treachery
and
cruelty
to
the
whole
countenance
examined
with
attention
its
capacity
of
helping
such
a
look
was
to
be
found
in
the
line
of
the
mouth
and
the
lines
of
the
orbits
of
the
eyes
being
much
too
horizontal
and
thin
still
in
the
effect
of
the
face
made
it
was
a
handsome
face
and
a
remarkable
one
its
owner
went
downstairs
into
the
courtyard
got
into
his
carriage
and
drove
away
not
many
people
had
talked
with
him
at
the
reception
he
had
stood
in
a
little
space
apart
and
monseigneur
might
have
been
warmer
in
his
manner
it
appeared
under
the
circumstances
rather
agreeable
to
him
to
see
the
common
people
dispersed
before
his
horses
and
often
barely
escaping
from
being
run
down
his
man
drove
as
if
he
were
charging
an
enemy
and
the
furious
recklessness
of
the
man
brought
no
check
into
the
face
or
to
the
lips
of
the
master
the
complaint
had
sometimes
made
itself
audible
even
in
that
deaf
city
and
dumb
age
that
in
the
narrow
streets
without
footways
the
fierce
patrician
custom
of
hard
driving
endangered
and
maimed
the
mere
vulgar
in
a
barbarous
manner
but
few
cared
enough
for
that
to
think
of
it
a
second
time
and
in
this
matter
as
in
all
others
the
common
wretches
were
left
to
get
out
of
their
difficulties
as
they
could
with
a
wild
rattle
and
clatter
and
an
inhuman
abandonment
of
consideration
not
easy
to
be
understood
in
these
days
the
carriage
dashed
through
streets
and
swept
round
corners
with
women
screaming
before
it
and
men
clutching
each
other
and
clutching
children
out
of
its
way
at
last
swooping
at
a
street
corner
by
a
fountain
one
of
its
wheels
came
to
a
sickening
little
jolt
and
there
was
a
loud
cry
from
a
number
of
voices
and
the
horses
reared
and
plunged
but
for
the
latter
inconvenience
the
carriage
probably
would
not
have
stopped
carriages
were
often
known
to
drive
on
and
leave
their
wounded
behind
and
why
not
but
the
frightened
valet
had
got
down
in
a
hurry
and
there
were
twenty
hands
at
the
horses
bridles
what
has
gone
wrong
said
monsieur
calmly
looking
out
a
tall
man
in
a
nightcap
had
caught
up
a
bundle
from
among
the
feet
of
the
horses
and
had
laid
it
on
the
basement
of
the
fountain
and
was
down
in
the
mud
and
wet
howling
over
it
like
a
wild
animal
pardon
monsieur
the
marquis
said
a
ragged
and
submissive
man
it
is
a
child
why
does
he
make
that
abominable
noise
is
it
his
child
excuse
me
monsieur
the
marquis
it
is
a
pity
yes
the
fountain
was
a
little
removed
for
the
street
opened
where
it
was
into
a
space
some
ten
or
twelve
yards
square
as
the
tall
man
suddenly
got
up
from
the
ground
and
came
running
at
the
carriage
monsieur
the
marquis
clapped
his
hand
for
an
instant
on
his
sword
hilt
killed
shrieked
the
man
in
wild
desperation
extending
both
arms
at
their
length
above
his
head
and
staring
at
him
dead
the
people
closed
round
and
looked
at
monsieur
the
marquis
there
was
nothing
revealed
by
the
many
eyes
that
looked
at
him
but
watchfulness
and
eagerness
there
was
no
visible
menacing
or
anger
neither
did
the
people
say
anything
after
the
first
cry
they
had
been
silent
and
they
remained
so
the
voice
of
the
submissive
man
who
had
spoken
was
flat
and
tame
in
its
extreme
submission
monsieur
the
marquis
ran
his
eyes
over
them
all
as
if
they
had
been
mere
rats
come
out
of
their
holes
he
took
out
his
purse
it
is
extraordinary
to
me
said
he
that
you
people
cannot
take
care
of
yourselves
and
your
children
one
or
the
other
of
you
is
for
ever
in
the
way
how
do
i
know
what
injury
you
have
done
my
horses
see
give
him
that
he
threw
out
a
gold
coin
for
the
valet
to
pick
up
and
all
the
heads
craned
forward
that
all
the
eyes
might
look
down
at
it
as
it
fell
the
tall
man
called
out
again
with
a
most
unearthly
cry
dead
he
was
arrested
by
the
quick
arrival
of
another
man
for
whom
the
rest
made
way
on
seeing
him
the
miserable
creature
fell
upon
his
shoulder
sobbing
and
crying
and
pointing
to
the
fountain
where
some
women
were
stooping
over
the
motionless
bundle
and
moving
gently
about
it
they
were
as
silent
however
as
the
men
i
know
all
i
know
all
said
the
last
comer
be
a
brave
man
my
gaspard
it
is
better
for
the
poor
little
plaything
to
die
so
than
to
live
it
has
died
in
a
moment
without
pain
could
it
have
lived
an
hour
as
happily
you
are
a
philosopher
you
there
said
the
marquis
smiling
how
do
they
call
you
they
call
me
defarge
of
what
trade
monsieur
the
marquis
vendor
of
wine
pick
up
that
philosopher
and
vendor
of
wine
said
the
marquis
throwing
him
another
gold
coin
and
spend
it
as
you
will
the
horses
there
are
they
right
without
deigning
to
look
at
the
assemblage
a
second
time
monsieur
the
marquis
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
was
just
being
driven
away
with
the
air
of
a
gentleman
who
had
accidentally
broke
some
common
thing
and
had
paid
for
it
and
could
afford
to
pay
for
it
when
his
ease
was
suddenly
disturbed
by
a
coin
flying
into
his
carriage
and
ringing
on
its
floor
hold
said
monsieur
the
marquis
hold
the
horses
who
threw
that
he
looked
to
the
spot
where
defarge
the
vendor
of
wine
had
stood
a
moment
before
but
the
wretched
father
was
grovelling
on
his
face
on
the
pavement
in
that
spot
and
the
figure
that
stood
beside
him
was
the
figure
of
a
dark
stout
woman
knitting
you
dogs
said
the
marquis
but
smoothly
and
with
an
unchanged
front
except
as
to
the
spots
on
his
nose
i
would
ride
over
any
of
you
very
willingly
and
exterminate
you
from
the
earth
if
i
knew
which
rascal
threw
at
the
carriage
and
if
that
brigand
were
sufficiently
near
it
he
should
be
crushed
under
the
wheels
so
cowed
was
their
condition
and
so
long
and
hard
their
experience
of
what
such
a
man
could
do
to
them
within
the
law
and
beyond
it
that
not
a
voice
or
a
hand
or
even
an
eye
was
raised
among
the
men
not
one
but
the
woman
who
stood
knitting
looked
up
steadily
and
looked
the
marquis
in
the
face
it
was
not
for
his
dignity
to
notice
it
his
contemptuous
eyes
passed
over
her
and
over
all
the
other
rats
and
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
again
and
gave
the
word
go
on
he
was
driven
on
and
other
carriages
came
whirling
by
in
quick
succession
the
minister
the

the
farmer

the
doctor
the
lawyer
the

a
bright
continuous
flow
came
whirling
by
the
rats

crept
out
of
their
holes
to
look
on
and
they
remained
looking
on
for
hours
soldiers
and
police
often
passing
between
them
and
the
spectacle
and
making
a
barrier
behind
which
they
slunk
and
through
which
they
peeped
the
father
had
long
ago
taken
up
his
bundle
and
bidden
himself
away
with
it
when
the
women
who
had
tended
the
bundle
while
it
lay
on
the
base
of
the
fountain
sat
there
watching
the
running
of
the
water
and
the
rolling
of
the
fancy
ball
when
the
one
woman
who
had
stood
conspicuous
knitting
still
knitted
on
with
the
steadfastness
of
fate
the
water
of
the
fountain

the
swift
river

the
day
ran
into
evening
so
much
life
in
the
city
ran
into
death
according
to
rule
time
and
tide
waited
for
no
man
the
rats
were
sleeping
close
together
in
their
dark
holes
again
the
fancy

was
lighted
up
at
supper
all

ran

monseigneur

beautiful
landscape
with
the
corn
bright
in
it
but
not
abundant
patches
of
poor
rye
where
corn
should
have
been
patches
of
poor
peas
and
beans
patches
of
most
coarse
vegetable
substitutes
for
wheat
on
inanimate
nature
as
on
the
men
and
women
who
cultivated
it
a
prevalent
tendency
towards
an
appearance
of
vegetating
unwillingly
a
dejected
disposition
to
give
up
and
wither
away
monsieur
the
marquis
in
his
travelling
carriage
which
might
have
been
lighter
conducted
by
four
post
horses
and
two
postilions
fagged
up
a
steep
hill
a
blush
on
the
countenance
of
monsieur
the
marquis
was
no
impeachment
of
his
high
breeding
it
was
not
from
within
it
was
occasioned
by
an
external
circumstance
beyond
his
control
the
setting
sun
the
sunset
struck
so
brilliantly
into
the
travelling
carriage
when
it
gained
the
hill
top
that
its
occupant
was
steeped
in
crimson
it
will
die
out
said
monsieur
the
marquis
glancing
at
his
hands
directly
in
effect
the
sun
was
so
low
that
it
dipped
at
the
moment
when
the
heavy
drag
had
been
adjusted
to
the
wheel
and
the
carriage
slid
down
hill
with
a
cinderous
smell
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
red
glow
departed
quickly
the
sun
and
the
marquis
going
down
together
there
was
no
glow
left
when
the
drag
was
taken
off
but
there
remained
a
broken
country
bold
and
open
a
little
village
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
a
broad
sweep
and
rise
beyond
it
a
church
tower
a
windmill
a
forest
for
the
chase
and
a
crag
with
a
fortress
on
it
used
as
a
prison
round
upon
all
these
darkening
objects
as
the
night
drew
on
the
marquis
looked
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
coming
near
home
the
village
had
its
one
poor
street
with
its
poor
brewery
poor
tannery
poor
tavern
poor
stable
yard
for
relays
of
post
horses
poor
fountain
all
usual
poor
appointments
it
had
its
poor
people
too
all
its
people
were
poor
and
many
of
them
were
sitting
at
their
doors
shredding
spare
onions
and
the
like
for
supper
while
many
were
at
the
fountain
washing
leaves
and
grasses
and
any
such
small
yieldings
of
the
earth
that
could
be
eaten
expressive
signs
of
what
made
them
poor
were
not
wanting
the
tax
for
the
state
the
tax
for
the
church
the
tax
for
the
lord
tax
local
and
tax
general
were
to
be
paid
here
and
to
be
paid
there
according
to
solemn
inscription
in
the
little
village
until
the
wonder
was
that
there
was
any
village
left
unswallowed
few
children
were
to
be
seen
and
no
dogs
as
to
the
men
and
women
their
choice
on
earth
was
stated
in
the
prospect
life
on
the
lowest
terms
that
could
sustain
it
down
in
the
little
village
under
the
mill
or
captivity
and
death
in
the
dominant
prison
on
the
crag
heralded
by
a
courier
in
advance
and
by
the
cracking
of
his
postilions
whips
which
twined
snake
like
about
their
heads
in
the
evening
air
as
if
he
came
attended
by
the
furies
monsieur
the
marquis
drew
up
in
his
travelling
carriage
at
the
posting
house
gate
it
was
hard
by
the
fountain
and
the
peasants
suspended
their
operations
to
look
at
him
he
looked
at
them
and
saw
in
them
without
knowing
it
the
slow
sure
filing
down
of
misery
worn
face
and
figure
that
was
to
make
the
meagreness
of
frenchmen
an
english
superstition
which
should
survive
the
truth
through
the
best
part
of
a
hundred
years
monsieur
the
marquis
cast
his
eyes
over
the
submissive
faces
that
drooped
before
him
as
the
like
of
himself
had
drooped
before
monseigneur
of
the
court
only
the
difference
was
that
these
faces
drooped
merely
to
suffer
and
not
to
propitiate
when
a
grizzled
mender
of
the
roads
joined
the
group
bring
me
hither
that
fellow
said
the
marquis
to
the
courier
the
fellow
was
brought
cap
in
hand
and
the
other
fellows
closed
round
to
look
and
listen
in
the
manner
of
the
people
at
the
paris
fountain
i
passed
you
on
the
road
monseigneur
it
is
true
i
had
the
honour
of
being
passed
on
the
road
coming
up
the
hill
and
at
the
top
of
the
hill
both
monseigneur
it
is
true
what
did
you
look
at
so
fixedly
monseigneur
i
looked
at
the
man
he
stooped
a
little
and
with
his
tattered
blue
cap
pointed
under
the
carriage
all
his
fellows
stooped
to
look
under
the
carriage
what
man
pig
and
why
look
there
pardon
monseigneur
he
swung
by
the
chain
of
the
shoe
the
drag
who
demanded
the
traveller
monseigneur
the
man
may
the
devil
carry
away
these
idiots
how
do
you
call
the
man
you
know
all
the
men
of
this
part
of
the
country
who
was
he
your
clemency
monseigneur
he
was
not
of
this
part
of
the
country
of
all
the
days
of
my
life
i
never
saw
him
swinging
by
the
chain
to
be
suffocated
with
your
gracious
permission
that
was
the
wonder
of
it
monseigneur
his
head
hanging
over
like
this
he
turned
himself
sideways
to
the
carriage
and
leaned
back
with
his
face
thrown
up
to
the
sky
and
his
head
hanging
down
then
recovered
himself
fumbled
with
his
cap
and
made
a
bow
what
was
he
like
monseigneur
he
was
whiter
than
the
miller
all
covered
with
dust
white
as
a
spectre
tall
as
a
spectre
the
picture
produced
an
immense
sensation
in
the
little
crowd
but
all
eyes
without
comparing
notes
with
other
eyes
looked
at
monsieur
the
marquis
perhaps
to
observe
whether
he
had
any
spectre
on
his
conscience
truly
you
did
well
said
the
marquis
felicitously
sensible
that
such
vermin
were
not
to
ruffle
him
to
see
a
thief
accompanying
my
carriage
and
not
open
that
great
mouth
of
yours
bah
put
him
aside
monsieur
gabelle
monsieur
gabelle
was
the
postmaster
and
some
other
taxing
functionary
united
he
had
come
out
with
great
obsequiousness
to
assist
at
this
examination
and
had
held
the
examined
by
the
drapery
of
his
arm
in
an
official
manner
bah
go
aside
said
monsieur
gabelle
lay
hands
on
this
stranger
if
he
seeks
to
lodge
in
your
village
to
night
and
be
sure
that
his
business
is
honest
gabelle
monseigneur
i
am
flattered
to
devote
myself
to
your
orders
did
he
run
away
fellow
where
is
that
accursed
the
accursed
was
already
under
the
carriage
with
some
half
dozen
particular
friends
pointing
out
the
chain
with
his
blue
cap
some
half
dozen
other
particular
friends
promptly
hauled
him
out
and
presented
him
breathless
to
monsieur
the
marquis
did
the
man
run
away
dolt
when
we
stopped
for
the
drag
monseigneur
he
precipitated
himself
over
the
hill
side
head
first
as
a
person
plunges
into
the
river
see
to
it
gabelle
go
on
the
half
dozen
who
were
peering
at
the
chain
were
still
among
the
wheels
like
sheep
the
wheels
turned
so
suddenly
that
they
were
lucky
to
save
their
skins
and
bones
they
had
very
little
else
to
save
or
they
might
not
have
been
so
fortunate
the
burst
with
which
the
carriage
started
out
of
the
village
and
up
the
rise
beyond
was
soon
checked
by
the
steepness
of
the
hill
gradually
it
subsided
to
a
foot
pace
swinging
and
lumbering
upward
among
the
many
sweet
scents
of
a
summer
night
the
postilions
with
a
thousand
gossamer
gnats
circling
about
them
in
lieu
of
the
furies
quietly
mended
the
points
to
the
lashes
of
their
whips
the
valet
walked
by
the
horses
the
courier
was
audible
trotting
on
ahead
into
the
dull
distance
at
the
steepest
point
of
the
hill
there
was
a
little
burial
ground
with
a
cross
and
a
new
large
figure
of
our
saviour
on
it
it
was
a
poor
figure
in
wood
done
by
some
inexperienced
rustic
carver
but
he
had
studied
the
figure
from
the
life
his
own
life
maybe
for
it
was
dreadfully
spare
and
thin
to
this
distressful
emblem
of
a
great
distress
that
had
long
been
growing
worse
and
was
not
at
its
worst
a
woman
was
kneeling
she
turned
her
head
as
the
carriage
came
up
to
her
rose
quickly
and
presented
herself
at
the
carriage
door
it
is
you
monseigneur
monseigneur
a
petition
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
but
with
his
unchangeable
face
monseigneur
looked
out
how
then
what
is
it
always
petitions
monseigneur
for
the
love
of
the
great
god
my
husband
the
forester
what
of
your
husband
the
forester
always
the
same
with
you
people
he
cannot
pay
something
he
has
paid
all
monseigneur
he
is
dead
well
he
is
quiet
can
i
restore
him
to
you
alas
no
monseigneur
but
he
lies
yonder
under
a
little
heap
of
poor
grass
well
monseigneur
there
are
so
many
little
heaps
of
poor
grass
again
well
she
looked
an
old
woman
but
was
young
her
manner
was
one
of
passionate
grief
by
turns
she
clasped
her
veinous
and
knotted
hands
together
with
wild
energy
and
laid
one
of
them
on
the
carriage
door
tenderly
caressingly
as
if
it
had
been
a
human
breast
and
could
be
expected
to
feel
the
appealing
touch
monseigneur
hear
me
monseigneur
hear
my
petition
my
husband
died
of
want
so
many
die
of
want
so
many
more
will
die
of
want
again
well
can
i
feed
them
monseigneur
the
good
god
knows
but
i
don
t
ask
it
my
petition
is
that
a
morsel
of
stone
or
wood
with
my
husband
s
name
may
be
placed
over
him
to
show
where
he
lies
otherwise
the
place
will
be
quickly
forgotten
it
will
never
be
found
when
i
am
dead
of
the
same
malady
i
shall
be
laid
under
some
other
heap
of
poor
grass
monseigneur
they
are
so
many
they
increase
so
fast
there
is
so
much
want
monseigneur
monseigneur
the
valet
had
put
her
away
from
the
door
the
carriage
had
broken
into
a
brisk
trot
the
postilions
had
quickened
the
pace
she
was
left
far
behind
and
monseigneur
again
escorted
by
the
furies
was
rapidly
diminishing
the
league
or
two
of
distance
that
remained
between
him
and
his
chateau
the
sweet
scents
of
the
summer
night
rose
all
around
him
and
rose
as
the
rain
falls
impartially
on
the
dusty
ragged
and
toil
worn
group
at
the
fountain
not
far
away
to
whom
the
mender
of
roads
with
the
aid
of
the
blue
cap
without
which
he
was
nothing
still
enlarged
upon
his
man
like
a
spectre
as
long
as
they
could
bear
it
by
degrees
as
they
could
bear
no
more
they
dropped
off
one
by
one
and
lights
twinkled
in
little
casements
which
lights
as
the
casements
darkened
and
more
stars
came
out
seemed
to
have
shot
up
into
the
sky
instead
of
having
been
extinguished
the
shadow
of
a
large
high
roofed
house
and
of
many
over
hanging
trees
was
upon
monsieur
the
marquis
by
that
time
and
the
shadow
was
exchanged
for
the
light
of
a
flambeau
as
his
carriage
stopped
and
the
great
door
of
his
chateau
was
opened
to
him
monsieur
charles
whom
i
expect
is
he
arrived
from
england
monseigneur
not
yet
ix
the
gorgon
s
head
it
was
a
heavy
mass
of
building
that
chateau
of
monsieur
the
marquis
with
a
large
stone
courtyard
before
it
and
two
stone
sweeps
of
staircase
meeting
in
a
stone
terrace
before
the
principal
door
a
stony
business
altogether
with
heavy
stone
balustrades
and
stone
urns
and
stone
flowers
and
stone
faces
of
men
and
stone
heads
of
lions
in
all
directions
as
if
the
gorgon
s
head
had
surveyed
it
when
it
was
finished
two
centuries
ago
up
the
broad
flight
of
shallow
steps
monsieur
the
marquis
flambeau
preceded
went
from
his
carriage
sufficiently
disturbing
the
darkness
to
elicit
loud
remonstrance
from
an
owl
in
the
roof
of
the
great
pile
of
stable
building
away
among
the
trees
all
else
was
so
quiet
that
the
flambeau
carried
up
the
steps
and
the
other
flambeau
held
at
the
great
door
burnt
as
if
they
were
in
a
close
room
of
state
instead
of
being
in
the
open
night
air
other
sound
than
the
owl
s
voice
there
was
none
save
the
falling
of
a
fountain
into
its
stone
basin
for
it
was
one
of
those
dark
nights
that
hold
their
breath
by
the
hour
together
and
then
heave
a
long
low
sigh
and
hold
their
breath
again
the
great
door
clanged
behind
him
and
monsieur
the
marquis
crossed
a
hall
grim
with
certain
old
boar
spears
swords
and
knives
of
the
chase
grimmer
with
certain
heavy
riding
rods
and
riding
whips
of
which
many
a
peasant
gone
to
his
benefactor
death
had
felt
the
weight
when
his
lord
was
angry
avoiding
the
larger
rooms
which
were
dark
and
made
fast
for
the
night
monsieur
the
marquis
with
his
flambeau
bearer
going
on
before
went
up
the
staircase
to
a
door
in
a
corridor
this
thrown
open
admitted
him
to
his
own
private
apartment
of
three
rooms
his
bed
chamber
and
two
others
high
vaulted
rooms
with
cool
uncarpeted
floors
great
dogs
upon
the
hearths
for
the
burning
of
wood
in
winter
time
and
all
luxuries
befitting
the
state
of
a
marquis
in
a
luxurious
age
and
country
the
fashion
of
the
last
louis
but
one
of
the
line
that
was
never
to
break
the
fourteenth
louis
was
conspicuous
in
their
rich
furniture
but
it
was
diversified
by
many
objects
that
were
illustrations
of
old
pages
in
the
history
of
france
a
supper
table
was
laid
for
two
in
the
third
of
the
rooms
a
round
room
in
one
of
the
chateau
s
four
extinguisher
topped
towers
a
small
lofty
room
with
its
window
wide
open
and
the
wooden
jalousie
blinds
closed
so
that
the
dark
night
only
showed
in
slight
horizontal
lines
of
black
alternating
with
their
broad
lines
of
stone
colour
my
nephew
said
the
marquis
glancing
at
the
supper
preparation
they
said
he
was
not
arrived
nor
was
he
but
he
had
been
expected
with
monseigneur
ah
it
is
not
probable
he
will
arrive
to
night
nevertheless
leave
the
table
as
it
is
i
shall
be
ready
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
monseigneur
was
ready
and
sat
down
alone
to
his
sumptuous
and
choice
supper
his
chair
was
opposite
to
the
window
and
he
had
taken
his
soup
and
was
raising
his
glass
of
bordeaux
to
his
lips
when
he
put
it
down
what
is
that
he
calmly
asked
looking
with
attention
at
the
horizontal
lines
of
black
and
stone
colour
monseigneur
that
outside
the
blinds
open
the
blinds
it
was
done
well
monseigneur
it
is
nothing
the
trees
and
the
night
are
all
that
are
here
the
servant
who
spoke
had
thrown
the
blinds
wide
had
looked
out
into
the
vacant
darkness
and
stood
with
that
blank
behind
him
looking
round
for
instructions
good
said
the
imperturbable
master
close
them
again
that
was
done
too
and
the
marquis
went
on
with
his
supper
he
was
half
way
through
it
when
he
again
stopped
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
hearing
the
sound
of
wheels
it
came
on
briskly
and
came
up
to
the
front
of
the
chateau
ask
who
is
arrived
it
was
the
nephew
of
monseigneur
he
had
been
some
few
leagues
behind
monseigneur
early
in
the
afternoon
he
had
diminished
the
distance
rapidly
but
not
so
rapidly
as
to
come
up
with
monseigneur
on
the
road
he
had
heard
of
monseigneur
at
the
posting
houses
as
being
before
him
he
was
to
be
told
said
monseigneur
that
supper
awaited
him
then
and
there
and
that
he
was
prayed
to
come
to
it
in
a
little
while
he
came
he
had
been
known
in
england
as
charles
darnay
monseigneur
received
him
in
a
courtly
manner
but
they
did
not
shake
hands
you
left
paris
yesterday
sir
he
said
to
monseigneur
as
he
took
his
seat
at
table
yesterday
and
you
i
come
direct
from
london
yes
you
have
been
a
long
time
coming
said
the
marquis
with
a
smile
on
the
contrary
i
come
direct
pardon
me
i
mean
not
a
long
time
on
the
journey
a
long
time
intending
the
journey
i
have
been
detained
by
the
nephew
stopped
a
moment
in
his
answer
various
business
without
doubt
said
the
polished
uncle
so
long
as
a
servant
was
present
no
other
words
passed
between
them
when
coffee
had
been
served
and
they
were
alone
together
the
nephew
looking
at
the
uncle
and
meeting
the
eyes
of
the
face
that
was
like
a
fine
mask
opened
a
conversation
i
have
come
back
sir
as
you
anticipate
pursuing
the
object
that
took
me
away
it
carried
me
into
great
and
unexpected
peril
but
it
is
a
sacred
object
and
if
it
had
carried
me
to
death
i
hope
it
would
have
sustained
me
not
to
death
said
the
uncle
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
to
death
i
doubt
sir
returned
the
nephew
whether
if
it
had
carried
me
to
the
utmost
brink
of
death
you
would
have
cared
to
stop
me
there
the
deepened
marks
in
the
nose
and
the
lengthening
of
the
fine
straight
lines
in
the
cruel
face
looked
ominous
as
to
that
the
uncle
made
a
graceful
gesture
of
protest
which
was
so
clearly
a
slight
form
of
good
breeding
that
it
was
not
reassuring
indeed
sir
pursued
the
nephew
for
anything
i
know
you
may
have
expressly
worked
to
give
a
more
suspicious
appearance
to
the
suspicious
circumstances
that
surrounded
me
no
no
no
said
the
uncle
pleasantly
but
however
that
may
be
resumed
the
nephew
glancing
at
him
with
deep
distrust
i
know
that
your
diplomacy
would
stop
me
by
any
means
and
would
know
no
scruple
as
to
means
my
friend
i
told
you
so
said
the
uncle
with
a
fine
pulsation
in
the
two
marks
do
me
the
favour
to
recall
that
i
told
you
so
long
ago
i
recall
it
thank
you
said
the
marquis
very
sweetly
indeed
his
tone
lingered
in
the
air
almost
like
the
tone
of
a
musical
instrument
in
effect
sir
pursued
the
nephew
i
believe
it
to
be
at
once
your
bad
fortune
and
my
good
fortune
that
has
kept
me
out
of
a
prison
in
france
here
i
do
not
quite
understand
returned
the
uncle
sipping
his
coffee
dare
i
ask
you
to
explain
i
believe
that
if
you
were
not
in
disgrace
with
the
court
and
had
not
been
overshadowed
by
that
cloud
for
years
past
a
letter
de
cachet
would
have
sent
me
to
some
fortress
indefinitely
it
is
possible
said
the
uncle
with
great
calmness
for
the
honour
of
the
family
i
could
even
resolve
to
incommode
you
to
that
extent
pray
excuse
me
i
perceive
that
happily
for
me
the
reception
of
the
day
before
yesterday
was
as
usual
a
cold
one
observed
the
nephew
i
would
not
say
happily
my
friend
returned
the
uncle
with
refined
politeness
i
would
not
be
sure
of
that
a
good
opportunity
for
consideration
surrounded
by
the
advantages
of
solitude
might
influence
your
destiny
to
far
greater
advantage
than
you
influence
it
for
yourself
but
it
is
useless
to
discuss
the
question
i
am
as
you
say
at
a
disadvantage
these
little
instruments
of
correction
these
gentle
aids
to
the
power
and
honour
of
families
these
slight
favours
that
might
so
incommode
you
are
only
to
be
obtained
now
by
interest
and
importunity
they
are
sought
by
so
many
and
they
are
granted
comparatively
to
so
few
it
used
not
to
be
so
but
france
in
all
such
things
is
changed
for
the
worse
our
not
remote
ancestors
held
the
right
of
life
and
death
over
the
surrounding
vulgar
from
this
room
many
such
dogs
have
been
taken
out
to
be
hanged
in
the
next
room
my
bedroom
one
fellow
to
our
knowledge
was
poniarded
on
the
spot
for
professing
some
insolent
delicacy
respecting
his
daughter
his
daughter
we
have
lost
many
privileges
a
new
philosophy
has
become
the
mode
and
the
assertion
of
our
station
in
these
days
might
i
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
would
but
might
cause
us
real
inconvenience
all
very
bad
very
bad
the
marquis
took
a
gentle
little
pinch
of
snuff
and
shook
his
head
as
elegantly
despondent
as
he
could
becomingly
be
of
a
country
still
containing
himself
that
great
means
of
regeneration
we
have
so
asserted
our
station
both
in
the
old
time
and
in
the
modern
time
also
said
the
nephew
gloomily
that
i
believe
our
name
to
be
more
detested
than
any
name
in
france
let
us
hope
so
said
the
uncle
detestation
of
the
high
is
the
involuntary
homage
of
the
low
there
is
not
pursued
the
nephew
in
his
former
tone
a
face
i
can
look
at
in
all
this
country
round
about
us
which
looks
at
me
with
any
deference
on
it
but
the
dark
deference
of
fear
and
slavery
a
compliment
said
the
marquis
to
the
grandeur
of
the
family
merited
by
the
manner
in
which
the
family
has
sustained
its
grandeur
hah
and
he
took
another
gentle
little
pinch
of
snuff
and
lightly
crossed
his
legs
but
when
his
nephew
leaning
an
elbow
on
the
table
covered
his
eyes
thoughtfully
and
dejectedly
with
his
hand
the
fine
mask
looked
at
him
sideways
with
a
stronger
concentration
of
keenness
closeness
and
dislike
than
was
comportable
with
its
wearer
s
assumption
of
indifference
repression
is
the
only
lasting
philosophy
the
dark
deference
of
fear
and
slavery
my
friend
observed
the
marquis
will
keep
the
dogs
obedient
to
the
whip
as
long
as
this
roof
looking
up
to
it
shuts
out
the
sky
that
might
not
be
so
long
as
the
marquis
supposed
if
a
picture
of
the
chateau
as
it
was
to
be
a
very
few
years
hence
and
of
fifty
like
it
as
they
too
were
to
be
a
very
few
years
hence
could
have
been
shown
to
him
that
night
he
might
have
been
at
a
loss
to
claim
his
own
from
the
ghastly
fire
charred
plunder
wrecked
rains
as
for
the
roof
he
vaunted
he
might
have
found
that
shutting
out
the
sky
in
a
new
way
to
wit
for
ever
from
the
eyes
of
the
bodies
into
which
its
lead
was
fired
out
of
the
barrels
of
a
hundred
thousand
muskets
meanwhile
said
the
marquis
i
will
preserve
the
honour
and
repose
of
the
family
if
you
will
not
but
you
must
be
fatigued
shall
we
terminate
our
conference
for
the
night
a
moment
more
an
hour
if
you
please
sir
said
the
nephew
we
have
done
wrong
and
are
reaping
the
fruits
of
wrong
we
have
done
wrong
repeated
the
marquis
with
an
inquiring
smile
and
delicately
pointing
first
to
his
nephew
then
to
himself
our
family
our
honourable
family
whose
honour
is
of
so
much
account
to
both
of
us
in
such
different
ways
even
in
my
father
s
time
we
did
a
world
of
wrong
injuring
every
human
creature
who
came
between
us
and
our
pleasure
whatever
it
was
why
need
i
speak
of
my
father
s
time
when
it
is
equally
yours
can
i
separate
my
father
s
twin
brother
joint
inheritor
and
next
successor
from
himself
death
has
done
that
said
the
marquis
and
has
left
me
answered
the
nephew
bound
to
a
system
that
is
frightful
to
me
responsible
for
it
but
powerless
in
it
seeking
to
execute
the
last
request
of
my
dear
mother
s
lips
and
obey
the
last
look
of
my
dear
mother
s
eyes
which
implored
me
to
have
mercy
and
to
redress
and
tortured
by
seeking
assistance
and
power
in
vain
seeking
them
from
me
my
nephew
said
the
marquis
touching
him
on
the
breast
with
his
forefinger
they
were
now
standing
by
the
hearth
you
will
for
ever
seek
them
in
vain
be
assured
every
fine
straight
line
in
the
clear
whiteness
of
his
face
was
cruelly
craftily
and
closely
compressed
while
he
stood
looking
quietly
at
his
nephew
with
his
snuff
box
in
his
hand
once
again
he
touched
him
on
the
breast
as
though
his
finger
were
the
fine
point
of
a
small
sword
with
which
in
delicate
finesse
he
ran
him
through
the
body
and
said
my
friend
i
will
die
perpetuating
the
system
under
which
i
have
lived
when
he
had
said
it
he
took
a
culminating
pinch
of
snuff
and
put
his
box
in
his
pocket
better
to
be
a
rational
creature
he
added
then
after
ringing
a
small
bell
on
the
table
and
accept
your
natural
destiny
but
you
are
lost
monsieur
charles
i
see
this
property
and
france
are
lost
to
me
said
the
nephew
sadly
i
renounce
them
are
they
both
yours
to
renounce
france
may
be
but
is
the
property
it
is
scarcely
worth
mentioning
but
is
it
yet
i
had
no
intention
in
the
words
i
used
to
claim
it
yet
if
it
passed
to
me
from
you
to
morrow
which
i
have
the
vanity
to
hope
is
not
probable
or
twenty
years
hence
you
do
me
too
much
honour
said
the
marquis
still
i
prefer
that
supposition
i
would
abandon
it
and
live
otherwise
and
elsewhere
it
is
little
to
relinquish
what
is
it
but
a
wilderness
of
misery
and
ruin
hah
said
the
marquis
glancing
round
the
luxurious
room
to
the
eye
it
is
fair
enough
here
but
seen
in
its
integrity
under
the
sky
and
by
the
daylight
it
is
a
crumbling
tower
of
waste
mismanagement
extortion
debt
mortgage
oppression
hunger
nakedness
and
suffering
hah
said
the
marquis
again
in
a
well
satisfied
manner
if
it
ever
becomes
mine
it
shall
be
put
into
some
hands
better
qualified
to
free
it
slowly
if
such
a
thing
is
possible
from
the
weight
that
drags
it
down
so
that
the
miserable
people
who
cannot
leave
it
and
who
have
been
long
wrung
to
the
last
point
of
endurance
may
in
another
generation
suffer
less
but
it
is
not
for
me
there
is
a
curse
on
it
and
on
all
this
land
and
you
said
the
uncle
forgive
my
curiosity
do
you
under
your
new
philosophy
graciously
intend
to
live
i
must
do
to
live
what
others
of
my
countrymen
even
with
nobility
at
their
backs
may
have
to
do
some
day
work
in
england
for
example
yes
the
family
honour
sir
is
safe
from
me
in
this
country
the
family
name
can
suffer
from
me
in
no
other
for
i
bear
it
in
no
other
the
ringing
of
the
bell
had
caused
the
adjoining
bed
chamber
to
be
lighted
it
now
shone
brightly
through
the
door
of
communication
the
marquis
looked
that
way
and
listened
for
the
retreating
step
of
his
valet
england
is
very
attractive
to
you
seeing
how
indifferently
you
have
prospered
there
he
observed
then
turning
his
calm
face
to
his
nephew
with
a
smile
i
have
already
said
that
for
my
prospering
there
i
am
sensible
i
may
be
indebted
to
you
sir
for
the
rest
it
is
my
refuge
they
say
those
boastful
english
that
it
is
the
refuge
of
many
you
know
a
compatriot
who
has
found
a
refuge
there
a
doctor
yes
with
a
daughter
yes
yes
said
the
marquis
you
are
fatigued
good
night
as
he
bent
his
head
in
his
most
courtly
manner
there
was
a
secrecy
in
his
smiling
face
and
he
conveyed
an
air
of
mystery
to
those
words
which
struck
the
eyes
and
ears
of
his
nephew
forcibly
at
the
same
time
the
thin
straight
lines
of
the
setting
of
the
eyes
and
the
thin
straight
lips
and
the
markings
in
the
nose
curved
with
a
sarcasm
that
looked
handsomely
diabolic
yes
repeated
the
marquis
a
doctor
with
a
daughter
yes
so
commences
the
new
philosophy
you
are
fatigued
good
night
it
would
have
been
of
as
much
avail
to
interrogate
any
stone
face
outside
the
chateau
as
to
interrogate
that
face
of
his
the
nephew
looked
at
him
in
vain
in
passing
on
to
the
door
good
night
said
the
uncle
i
look
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
in
the
morning
good
repose
light
monsieur
my
nephew
to
his
chamber
there
and
burn
monsieur
my
nephew
in
his
bed
if
you
will
he
added
to
himself
before
he
rang
his
little
bell
again
and
summoned
his
valet
to
his
own
bedroom
the
valet
come
and
gone
monsieur
the
marquis
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
loose
chamber
robe
to
prepare
himself
gently
for
sleep
that
hot
still
night
rustling
about
the
room
his
softly
slippered
feet
making
no
noise
on
the
floor
he
moved
like
a
refined
tiger
looked
like
some
enchanted
marquis
of
the
impenitently
wicked
sort
in
story
whose
periodical
change
into
tiger
form
was
either
just
going
off
or
just
coming
on
he
moved
from
end
to
end
of
his
voluptuous
bedroom
looking
again
at
the
scraps
of
the
day
s
journey
that
came
unbidden
into
his
mind
the
slow
toil
up
the
hill
at
sunset
the
setting
sun
the
descent
the
mill
the
prison
on
the
crag
the
little
village
in
the
hollow
the
peasants
at
the
fountain
and
the
mender
of
roads
with
his
blue
cap
pointing
out
the
chain
under
the
carriage
that
fountain
suggested
the
paris
fountain
the
little
bundle
lying
on
the
step
the
women
bending
over
it
and
the
tall
man
with
his
arms
up
crying
dead
i
am
cool
now
said
monsieur
the
marquis
and
may
go
to
bed
so
leaving
only
one
light
burning
on
the
large
hearth
he
let
his
thin
gauze
curtains
fall
around
him
and
heard
the
night
break
its
silence
with
a
long
sigh
as
he
composed
himself
to
sleep
the
stone
faces
on
the
outer
walls
stared
blindly
at
the
black
night
for
three
heavy
hours
for
three
heavy
hours
the
horses
in
the
stables
rattled
at
their
racks
the
dogs
barked
and
the
owl
made
a
noise
with
very
little
resemblance
in
it
to
the
noise
conventionally
assigned
to
the
owl
by
men
poets
but
it
is
the
obstinate
custom
of
such
creatures
hardly
ever
to
say
what
is
set
down
for
them
for
three
heavy
hours
the
stone
faces
of
the
chateau
lion
and
human
stared
blindly
at
the
night
dead
darkness
lay
on
all
the
landscape
dead
darkness
added
its
own
hush
to
the
hushing
dust
on
all
the
roads
the
burial
place
had
got
to
the
pass
that
its
little
heaps
of
poor
grass
were
undistinguishable
from
one
another
the
figure
on
the
cross
might
have
come
down
for
anything
that
could
be
seen
of
it
in
the
village
taxers
and
taxed
were
fast
asleep
dreaming
perhaps
of
banquets
as
the
starved
usually
do
and
of
ease
and
rest
as
the
driven
slave
and
the
yoked
ox
may
its
lean
inhabitants
slept
soundly
and
were
fed
and
freed
the
fountain
in
the
village
flowed
unseen
and
unheard
and
the
fountain
at
the
chateau
dropped
unseen
and
unheard
both
melting
away
like
the
minutes
that
were
falling
from
the
spring
of
time
through
three
dark
hours
then
the
grey
water
of
both
began
to
be
ghostly
in
the
light
and
the
eyes
of
the
stone
faces
of
the
chateau
were
opened
lighter
and
lighter
until
at
last
the
sun
touched
the
tops
of
the
still
trees
and
poured
its
radiance
over
the
hill
in
the
glow
the
water
of
the
chateau
fountain
seemed
to
turn
to
blood
and
the
stone
faces
crimsoned
the
carol
of
the
birds
was
loud
and
high
and
on
the
weather
beaten
sill
of
the
great
window
of
the
bed
chamber
of
monsieur
the
marquis
one
little
bird
sang
its
sweetest
song
with
all
its
might
at
this
the
nearest
stone
face
seemed
to
stare
amazed
and
with
open
mouth
and
dropped
under
jaw
looked
awe
stricken
now
the
sun
was
full
up
and
movement
began
in
the
village
casement
windows
opened
crazy
doors
were
unbarred
and
people
came
forth
shivering
chilled
as
yet
by
the
new
sweet
air
then
began
the
rarely
lightened
toil
of
the
day
among
the
village
population
some
to
the
fountain
some
to
the
fields
men
and
women
here
to
dig
and
delve
men
and
women
there
to
see
to
the
poor
live
stock
and
lead
the
bony
cows
out
to
such
pasture
as
could
be
found
by
the
roadside
in
the
church
and
at
the
cross
a
kneeling
figure
or
two
attendant
on
the
latter
prayers
the
led
cow
trying
for
a
breakfast
among
the
weeds
at
its
foot
the
chateau
awoke
later
as
became
its
quality
but
awoke
gradually
and
surely
first
the
lonely
boar
spears
and
knives
of
the
chase
had
been
reddened
as
of
old
then
had
gleamed
trenchant
in
the
morning
sunshine
now
doors
and
windows
were
thrown
open
horses
in
their
stables
looked
round
over
their
shoulders
at
the
light
and
freshness
pouring
in
at
doorways
leaves
sparkled
and
rustled
at
iron
grated
windows
dogs
pulled
hard
at
their
chains
and
reared
impatient
to
be
loosed
all
these
trivial
incidents
belonged
to
the
routine
of
life
and
the
return
of
morning
surely
not
so
the
ringing
of
the
great
bell
of
the
chateau
nor
the
running
up
and
down
the
stairs
nor
the
hurried
figures
on
the
terrace
nor
the
booting
and
tramping
here
and
there
and
everywhere
nor
the
quick
saddling
of
horses
and
riding
away
what
winds
conveyed
this
hurry
to
the
grizzled
mender
of
roads
already
at
work
on
the
hill
top
beyond
the
village
with
his
day
s
dinner
not
much
to
carry
lying
in
a
bundle
that
it
was
worth
no
crow
s
while
to
peck
at
on
a
heap
of
stones
had
the
birds
carrying
some
grains
of
it
to
a
distance
dropped
one
over
him
as
they
sow
chance
seeds
whether
or
no
the
mender
of
roads
ran
on
the
sultry
morning
as
if
for
his
life
down
the
hill
knee
high
in
dust
and
never
stopped
till
he
got
to
the
fountain
all
the
people
of
the
village
were
at
the
fountain
standing
about
in
their
depressed
manner
and
whispering
low
but
showing
no
other
emotions
than
grim
curiosity
and
surprise
the
led
cows
hastily
brought
in
and
tethered
to
anything
that
would
hold
them
were
looking
stupidly
on
or
lying
down
chewing
the
cud
of
nothing
particularly
repaying
their
trouble
which
they
had
picked
up
in
their
interrupted
saunter
some
of
the
people
of
the
chateau
and
some
of
those
of
the
posting
house
and
all
the
taxing
authorities
were
armed
more
or
less
and
were
crowded
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
street
in
a
purposeless
way
that
was
highly
fraught
with
nothing
already
the
mender
of
roads
had
penetrated
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
fifty
particular
friends
and
was
smiting
himself
in
the
breast
with
his
blue
cap
what
did
all
this
portend
and
what
portended
the
swift
hoisting
up
of
monsieur
gabelle
behind
a
servant
on
horseback
and
the
conveying
away
of
the
said
gabelle
double
laden
though
the
horse
was
at
a
gallop
like
a
new
version
of
the
german
ballad
of
leonora
it
portended
that
there
was
one
stone
face
too
many
up
at
the
chateau
the
gorgon
had
surveyed
the
building
again
in
the
night
and
had
added
the
one
stone
face
wanting
the
stone
face
for
which
it
had
waited
through
about
two
hundred
years
it
lay
back
on
the
pillow
of
monsieur
the
marquis
it
was
like
a
fine
mask
suddenly
startled
made
angry
and
petrified
driven
home
into
the
heart
of
the
stone
figure
attached
to
it
was
a
knife
round
its
hilt
was
a
frill
of
paper
on
which
was
scrawled
drive
him
fast
to
his
tomb
this
from
jacques
x
two
promises
more
months
to
the
number
of
twelve
had
come
and
gone
and
mr
charles
darnay
was
established
in
england
as
a
higher
teacher
of
the
french
language
who
was
conversant
with
french
literature
in
this
age
he
would
have
been
a
professor
in
that
age
he
was
a
tutor
he
read
with
young
men
who
could
find
any
leisure
and
interest
for
the
study
of
a
living
tongue
spoken
all
over
the
world
and
he
cultivated
a
taste
for
its
stores
of
knowledge
and
fancy
he
could
write
of
them
besides
in
sound
english
and
render
them
into
sound
english
such
masters
were
not
at
that
time
easily
found
princes
that
had
been
and
kings
that
were
to
be
were
not
yet
of
the
teacher
class
and
no
ruined
nobility
had
dropped
out
of
tellson
s
ledgers
to
turn
cooks
and
carpenters
as
a
tutor
whose
attainments
made
the
student
s
way
unusually
pleasant
and
profitable
and
as
an
elegant
translator
who
brought
something
to
his
work
besides
mere
dictionary
knowledge
young
mr
darnay
soon
became
known
and
encouraged
he
was
well
acquainted
more
over
with
the
circumstances
of
his
country
and
those
were
of
ever
growing
interest
so
with
great
perseverance
and
untiring
industry
he
prospered
in
london
he
had
expected
neither
to
walk
on
pavements
of
gold
nor
to
lie
on
beds
of
roses
if
he
had
had
any
such
exalted
expectation
he
would
not
have
prospered
he
had
expected
labour
and
he
found
it
and
did
it
and
made
the
best
of
it
in
this
his
prosperity
consisted
a
certain
portion
of
his
time
was
passed
at
cambridge
where
he
read
with
undergraduates
as
a
sort
of
tolerated
smuggler
who
drove
a
contraband
trade
in
european
languages
instead
of
conveying
greek
and
latin
through
the
custom
house
the
rest
of
his
time
he
passed
in
london
now
from
the
days
when
it
was
always
summer
in
eden
to
these
days
when
it
is
mostly
winter
in
fallen
latitudes
the
world
of
a
man
has
invariably
gone
one
way
charles
darnay
s
way
the
way
of
the
love
of
a
woman
he
had
loved
lucie
manette
from
the
hour
of
his
danger
he
had
never
heard
a
sound
so
sweet
and
dear
as
the
sound
of
her
compassionate
voice
he
had
never
seen
a
face
so
tenderly
beautiful
as
hers
when
it
was
confronted
with
his
own
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
that
had
been
dug
for
him
but
he
had
not
yet
spoken
to
her
on
the
subject
the
assassination
at
the
deserted
chateau
far
away
beyond
the
heaving
water
and
the
long
