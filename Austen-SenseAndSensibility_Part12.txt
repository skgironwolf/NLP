introduction
with
the
title
of
sense
and
sensibility
is
connected
one
of
those
minor
problems
which
delight
the
cummin
splitters
of
criticism
in
the
cecilia
of
madame
d
arblay
the
forerunner
if
not
the
model
of
miss
austen
is
a
sentence
which
at
first
sight
suggests
some
relationship
to
the
name
of
the
book
which
in
the
present
series
inaugurated
miss
austen
s
novels
the
whole
of
this
unfortunate
business
says
a
certain
didactic
dr
lyster
talking
in
capitals
towards
the
end
of
volume
three
of
cecilia
has
been
the
result
of
pride
and
prejudice
and
looking
to
the
admitted
familiarity
of
miss
austen
with
madame
d
arblay
s
work
it
has
been
concluded
that
miss
austen
borrowed
from
cecilia
the
title
of
her
second
novel
but
here
comes
in
the
little
problem
to
which
we
have
referred
pride
and
prejudice
it
is
true
was
written
and
finished
before
sense
and
sensibility
its
original
title
for
several
years
being
first
impressions
then
in
1797
the
author
fell
to
work
upon
an
older
essay
in
letters
la
richardson
called
elinor
and
marianne
which
she
re
christened
sense
and
sensibility
this
as
we
know
was
her
first
published
book
and
whatever
may
be
the
connection
between
the
title
of
pride
and
prejudice
and
the
passage
in
cecilia
there
is
an
obvious
connection
between
the
title
of
pride
and
prejudice
and
the
title
of
sense
and
sensibility
if
miss
austen
re
christened
elinor
and
marianne
before
she
changed
the
title
of
first
impressions
as
she
well
may
have
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
the
name
of
pride
and
prejudice
has
anything
to
do
with
cecilia
which
besides
had
been
published
at
least
twenty
years
before
upon
the
whole
therefore
it
is
most
likely
that
the
passage
in
madame
d
arblay
is
a
mere
coincidence
and
that
in
sense
and
sensibility
as
well
as
in
the
novel
that
succeeded
it
in
publication
miss
austen
after
the
fashion
of
the
old
morality
plays
simply
substituted
the
leading
characteristics
of
her
principal
personages
for
their
names
indeed
in
sense
and
sensibility
the
sense
of
elinor
and
the
sensibility
or
rather
sensiblerie
of
marianne
are
markedly
emphasised
in
the
opening
pages
of
the
book
but
miss
austen
subsequently
and
as
we
think
wisely
discarded
in
her
remaining
efforts
the
cheap
attraction
of
an
alliterative
title
emma
and
persuasion
northanger
abbey
and
mansfield
park
are
names
far
more
in
consonance
with
the
quiet
tone
of
her
easy
and
unobtrusive
art
elinor
and
marianne
was
originally
written
about
1792
after
the
completion
or
partial
completion
for
it
was
again
revised
in
1811
of
first
impressions
subsequently
pride
and
prejudice
miss
austen
set
about
recasting
elinor
and
marianne
then
composed
in
the
form
of
letters
and
she
had
no
sooner
accomplished
this
task
than
she
began
northanger
abbey
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
to
what
extent
she
remodelled
sense
and
sensibility
in
1797
98
for
we
are
told
that
previous
to
its
publication
in
1811
she
again
devoted
a
considerable
time
to
its
preparation
for
the
press
and
it
is
clear
that
this
does
not
mean
the
correction
of
proofs
alone
but
also
a
preliminary
revision
of
ms
especially
would
it
be
interesting
if
we
could
ascertain
whether
any
of
its
more
finished
passages
e
g
the
admirable
conversation
between
the
miss
dashwoods
and
willoughby
in
chapter
x
were
the
result
of
those
fallow
and
apparently
barren
years
at
bath
and
southampton
or
whether
they
were
already
part
of
the
second
version
of
1797
98
but
upon
this
matter
the
records
are
mute
a
careful
examination
of
the
correspondence
published
by
lord
brabourne
in
1884
only
reveals
two
definite
references
to
sense
and
sensibility
and
these
are
absolutely
unfruitful
in
suggestion
in
april
1811
she
speaks
of
having
corrected
two
sheets
of
s
and
s
which
she
has
scarcely
a
hope
of
getting
out
in
the
following
june
and
in
september
an
extract
from
the
diary
of
another
member
of
the
family
indirectly
discloses
the
fact
that
the
book
had
by
that
time
been
published
this
extract
is
a
brief
reference
to
a
letter
which
had
been
received
from
cassandra
austen
begging
her
correspondent
not
to
mention
that
aunt
jane
wrote
sense
and
sensibility
beyond
these
minute
items
of
information
and
the
statement
already
referred
to
in
the
introduction
to
pride
and
prejudice
that
she
considered
herself
overpaid
for
the
labour
she
had
bestowed
upon
it
absolutely
nothing
seems
to
have
been
preserved
by
her
descendants
respecting
her
first
printed
effort
in
the
absence
of
particulars
some
of
her
critics
have
fallen
to
speculate
upon
the
reason
which
made
her
select
it
and
not
pride
and
prejudice
for
her
d
but
and
they
have
perhaps
naturally
found
in
the
fact
a
fresh
confirmation
of
that
traditional
blindness
of
authors
to
their
own
best
work
which
is
one
of
the
commonplaces
of
literary
history
but
this
is
to
premise
that
she
did
regard
it
as
her
masterpiece
a
fact
which
apart
from
this
accident
of
priority
of
issue
is
as
far
as
we
are
aware
nowhere
asserted
a
simpler
solution
is
probably
that
of
the
three
novels
she
had
written
or
sketched
by
1811
pride
and
prejudice
was
languishing
under
the
stigma
of
having
been
refused
by
one
bookseller
without
the
formality
of
inspection
while
northanger
abbey
was
lying
perdu
in
another
bookseller
s
drawer
at
bath
in
these
circumstances
it
is
intelligible
that
she
should
turn
to
sense
and
sensibility
when
at
length
upon
the
occasion
of
a
visit
to
her
brother
in
london
in
the
spring
of
1811
mr
t
egerton
of
the
military
library
whitehall
dawned
upon
the
horizon
as
a
practicable
publisher
by
the
time
sense
and
sensibility
left
the
press
miss
austen
was
again
domiciled
at
chawton
cottage
for
those
accustomed
to
the
swarming
reviews
of
our
day
with
their
babel
of
notices
it
may
seem
strange
that
there
should
be
no
record
of
the
effect
produced
seeing
that
as
already
stated
the
book
sold
well
enough
to
enable
its
putter
forth
to
hand
over
to
its
author
what
mr
gargery
in
great
expectations
would
have
described
as
a
cool
150
surely
mr
egerton
who
had
visited
miss
austen
at
sloane
street
must
have
later
conveyed
to
her
some
intelligence
of
the
way
in
which
her
work
had
been
welcomed
by
the
public
but
if
he
did
it
is
no
longer
discoverable
mr
austen
leigh
her
first
and
best
biographer
could
find
no
account
either
of
the
publication
or
of
the
author
s
feelings
thereupon
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
judge
the
critical
verdicts
she
obtained
were
mainly
derived
from
her
own
relatives
and
intimate
friends
and
some
of
these
latter
if
one
may
trust
a
little
anthology
which
she
herself
collected
and
from
which
mr
austen
leigh
prints
extracts
must
have
been
more
often
exasperating
than
sympathetic
the
long
chorus
of
intelligent
approval
by
which
she
was
afterwards
greeted
did
not
begin
to
be
really
audible
before
her
death
and
her
fit
audience
during
her
lifetime
must
have
been
emphatically
few
of
two
criticisms
which
came
out
in
the
quarterly
early
in
the
century
she
could
only
have
seen
one
that
of
1815
the
other
by
archbishop
whately
the
first
which
treated
her
in
earnest
did
not
appear
until
she
had
been
three
years
dead
dr
whately
deals
mainly
with
mansfield
park
and
persuasion
his
predecessor
professed
to
review
emma
though
he
also
gives
brief
summaries
of
sense
and
sensibility
and
pride
and
prejudice
mr
austen
leigh
we
think
speaks
too
contemptuously
of
this
initial
notice
of
1815
if
at
certain
points
it
is
half
hearted
and
inadequate
it
is
still
fairly
accurate
in
its
recognition
of
miss
austen
s
supreme
merit
as
contrasted
with
her
contemporaries
to
wit
her
skill
in
investing
the
fortunes
of
ordinary
characters
and
the
narrative
of
common
occurrences
with
all
the
sustained
excitement
of
romance
the
reviewer
points
out
very
justly
that
this
kind
of
work
being
deprived
of
all
that
according
to
bayes
goes
to
elevate
and
surprise
must
make
amends
by
displaying
depth
of
knowledge
and
dexterity
of
execution
and
in
these
qualities
even
with
such
living
competitors
of
her
own
sex
as
miss
edgeworth
and
miss
brunton
whose
self
control
came
out
in
the
same
year
as
sense
and
sensibility
he
does
not
scruple
to
declare
that
miss
austen
stands
almost
alone
if
he
omits
to
lay
stress
upon
her
judgment
her
nice
sense
of
fitness
her
restraint
her
fine
irony
and
the
delicacy
of
her
artistic
touch
something
must
be
allowed
for
the
hesitations
and
reservations
which
invariably
beset
the
critical
pioneer
to
contend
however
for
a
moment
that
the
present
volume
is
miss
austen
s
greatest
as
it
was
her
first
published
novel
would
be
a
mere
exercise
in
paradox
there
are
who
swear
by
persuasion
there
are
who
prefer
emma
and
mansfield
park
there
is
a
large
contingent
for
pride
and
prejudice
and
there
is
even
a
section
which
advocates
the
pre
eminence
of
northanger
abbey
but
no
one
as
far
as
we
can
remember
has
ever
put
sense
and
sensibility
first
nor
can
we
believe
that
its
author
did
so
herself
and
yet
it
is
she
herself
who
has
furnished
the
standard
by
which
we
judge
it
and
it
is
by
comparison
with
pride
and
prejudice
in
which
the
leading
characters
are
also
two
sisters
that
we
assess
and
depress
its
merit
the
elinor
and
marianne
of
sense
and
sensibility
are
only
inferior
when
they
are
contrasted
with
the
elizabeth
and
jane
of
pride
and
prejudice
and
even
then
it
is
probably
because
we
personally
like
the
handsome
and
amiable
jane
bennet
rather
better
than
the
obsolete
survival
of
the
sentimental
novel
represented
by
marianne
dashwood
darcy
and
bingley
again
are
much
more
likeable
to
use
lady
queensberry
s
word
than
the
colourless
edward
ferrars
and
the
stiff
jointed
colonel
brandon
yet
it
might
not
unfairly
be
contended
that
there
is
more
fidelity
to
what
mr
thomas
hardy
has
termed
life
s
little
ironies
in
miss
austen
s
disposal
of
the
two
miss
dashwoods
than
there
is
in
her
disposal
of
the
heroines
of
pride
and
prejudice
every
one
does
not
get
a
bingley
or
a
darcy
with
a
park
but
a
good
many
sensible
girls
like
elinor
pair
off
contentedly
with
poor
creatures
like
edward
ferrars
while
not
a
few
enthusiasts
like
marianne
decline
at
last
upon
middle
aged
colonels
with
flannel
waistcoats
george
eliot
we
fancy
would
have
held
that
the
fates
of
elinor
and
marianne
were
more
probable
than
the
fortunes
of
jane
and
eliza
bennet
that
of
the
remaining
characters
there
is
certainly
none
to
rival
mr
bennet
or
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
or
the
ineffable
mr
collins
of
pride
and
prejudice
is
true
but
we
confess
to
a
kindness
for
vulgar
matchmaking
mrs
jennings
with
her
still
room
parmaceti
for
an
inward
bruise
in
the
shape
of
a
glass
of
old
constantia
and
for
the
diluted
squire
western
sir
john
middleton
whose
horror
of
being
alone
carries
him
to
the
point
of
rejoicing
in
the
acquisition
of
two
to
the
population
of
london
excellent
again
are
mr
palmer
and
his
wife
excellent
in
their
sordid
veracity
the
self
seeking
figures
of
the
miss
steeles
but
the
pearls
of
the
book
must
be
allowed
to
be
that
egregious
amateur
in
toothpick
cases
mr
robert
ferrars
with
his
excursus
in
chapter
xxxvi
on
life
in
a
cottage
and
the
admirably
matched
mr
and
mrs
john
dashwood
miss
austen
herself
has
never
done
anything
better
than
the
inimitable
and
oft
quoted
chapter
wherein
is
debated
between
the
last
named
pair
the
momentous
matter
of
the
amount
to
be
devoted
to
mrs
dashwood
and
her
daughters
while
the
suggestion
in
chapters
xxxiii
and
xxxiv
that
the
owner
of
norland
was
once
within
some
thousands
of
having
to
sell
out
at
a
loss
deserves
to
be
remembered
with
that
other
memorable
escape
of
sir
roger
de
coverley
s
ancestor
who
was
only
not
killed
in
the
civil
wars
because
he
was
sent
out
of
the
field
upon
a
private
message
the
day
before
the
battle
of
worcester
of
local
colouring
there
is
as
little
in
sense
and
sensibility
as
in
pride
and
prejudice
it
is
not
unlikely
that
some
memories
of
steventon
may
survive
in
norland
and
it
may
be
noted
that
there
is
actually
a
barton
place
to
the
north
of
exeter
not
far
from
lord
iddesleigh
s
well
known
seat
of
upton
pynes
it
is
scarcely
possible
also
not
to
believe
that
in
mrs
jennings
s
description
of
delaford
a
nice
place
i
can
tell
you
exactly
what
i
call
a
nice
old
fashioned
place
full
of
comforts
and
conveniences
quite
shut
in
with
great
garden
walls
that
are
covered
with
the
best
fruit
trees
in
the
country
and
such
a
mulberry
tree
in
one
corner
miss
austen
had
in
mind
some
real
hampshire
or
devonshire
country
house
in
any
case
it
comes
nearer
a
picture
than
what
we
usually
get
from
her
pen
then
there
is
a
dovecote
some
delightful
stew
ponds
and
a
very
pretty
canal
and
everything
in
short
that
one
could
wish
for
and
moreover
it
is
close
to
the
church
and
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
turnpike
road
so
tis
never
dull
for
if
you
only
go
and
sit
up
in
an
old
yew
arbour
behind
the
house
you
may
see
all
the
carriages
that
pass
along
the
last
lines
suggest
those
quaint
gazebos
and
alcoves
which
in
the
coaching
days
were
so
often
to
be
found
perched
at
the
roadside
where
one
might
sit
and
watch
the
dover
or
canterbury
stage
go
whirling
by
of
genteel
accomplishments
there
is
a
touch
in
the
landscape
in
coloured
silks
which
charlotte
palmer
had
worked
at
school
chap
xxvi
and
of
old
remedies
for
the
lost
art
of
swooning
in
the

the
mention
of
a
dance
as
a
little
hop
in
chapter
ix
reads
like
a
premature
instance
of
middle
victorian
slang
but
nothing
is
new
even
in
a
novel
and
hop
in
this
sense
is
at
least
as
old
as

chapter
i
the
family
of
dashwood
had
long
been
settled
in
sussex
their
estate
was
large
and
their
residence
was
at
norland
park
in
the
centre
of
their
property
where
for
many
generations
they
had
lived
in
so
respectable
a
manner
as
to
engage
the
general
good
opinion
of
their
surrounding
acquaintance
the
late
owner
of
this
estate
was
a
single
man
who
lived
to
a
very
advanced
age
and
who
for
many
years
of
his
life
had
a
constant
companion
and
housekeeper
in
his
sister
but
her
death
which
happened
ten
years
before
his
own
produced
a
great
alteration
in
his
home
for
to
supply
her
loss
he
invited
and
received
into
his
house
the
family
of
his
nephew
mr
henry
dashwood
the
legal
inheritor
of
the
norland
estate
and
the
person
to
whom
he
intended
to
bequeath
it
in
the
society
of
his
nephew
and
niece
and
their
children
the
old
gentleman
s
days
were
comfortably
spent
his
attachment
to
them
all
increased
the
constant
attention
of
mr
and
mrs
henry
dashwood
to
his
wishes
which
proceeded
not
merely
from
interest
but
from
goodness
of
heart
gave
him
every
degree
of
solid
comfort
which
his
age
could
receive
and
the
cheerfulness
of
the
children
added
a
relish
to
his
existence
by
a
former
marriage
mr
henry
dashwood
had
one
son
by
his
present
lady
three
daughters
the
son
a
steady
respectable
young
man
was
amply
provided
for
by
the
fortune
of
his
mother
which
had
been
large
and
half
of
which
devolved
on
him
on
his
coming
of
age
by
his
own
marriage
likewise
which
happened
soon
afterwards
he
added
to
his
wealth
to
him
therefore
the
succession
to
the
norland
estate
was
not
so
really
important
as
to
his
sisters
for
their
fortune
independent
of
what
might
arise
to
them
from
their
father
s
inheriting
that
property
could
be
but
small
their
mother
had
nothing
and
their
father
only
seven
thousand
pounds
in
his
own
disposal
for
the
remaining
moiety
of
his
first
wife
s
fortune
was
also
secured
to
her
child
and
he
had
only
a
life
interest
in
it
the
old
gentleman
died
his
will
was
read
and
like
almost
every
other
will
gave
as
much
disappointment
as
pleasure
he
was
neither
so
unjust
nor
so
ungrateful
as
to
leave
his
estate
from
his
nephew
but
he
left
it
to
him
on
such
terms
as
destroyed
half
the
value
of
the
bequest
mr
dashwood
had
wished
for
it
more
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
and
daughters
than
for
himself
or
his
son
but
to
his
son
and
his
son
s
son
a
child
of
four
years
old
it
was
secured
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
to
himself
no
power
of
providing
for
those
who
were
most
dear
to
him
and
who
most
needed
a
provision
by
any
charge
on
the
estate
or
by
any
sale
of
its
valuable
woods
the
whole
was
tied
up
for
the
benefit
of
this
child
who
in
occasional
visits
with
his
father
and
mother
at
norland
had
so
far
gained
on
the
affections
of
his
uncle
by
such
attractions
as
are
by
no
means
unusual
in
children
of
two
or
three
years
old
an
imperfect
articulation
an
earnest
desire
of
having
his
own
way
many
cunning
tricks
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
as
to
outweigh
all
the
value
of
all
the
attention
which
for
years
he
had
received
from
his
niece
and
her
daughters
he
meant
not
to
be
unkind
however
and
as
a
mark
of
his
affection
for
the
three
girls
he
left
them
a
thousand
pounds
a
piece
mr
dashwood
s
disappointment
was
at
first
severe
but
his
temper
was
cheerful
and
sanguine
and
he
might
reasonably
hope
to
live
many
years
and
by
living
economically
lay
by
a
considerable
sum
from
the
produce
of
an
estate
already
large
and
capable
of
almost
immediate
improvement
but
the
fortune
which
had
been
so
tardy
in
coming
was
his
only
one
twelvemonth
he
survived
his
uncle
no
longer
and
ten
thousand
pounds
including
the
late
legacies
was
all
that
remained
for
his
widow
and
daughters
his
son
was
sent
for
as
soon
as
his
danger
was
known
and
to
him
mr
dashwood
recommended
with
all
the
strength
and
urgency
which
illness
could
command
the
interest
of
his
mother
in
law
and
sisters
mr
john
dashwood
had
not
the
strong
feelings
of
the
rest
of
the
family
but
he
was
affected
by
a
recommendation
of
such
a
nature
at
such
a
time
and
he
promised
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
make
them
comfortable
his
father
was
rendered
easy
by
such
an
assurance
and
mr
john
dashwood
had
then
leisure
to
consider
how
much
there
might
prudently
be
in
his
power
to
do
for
them
[illustration
his
son
s
son
a
child
of
four
years
old
]
he
was
not
an
ill
disposed
young
man
unless
to
be
rather
cold
hearted
and
rather
selfish
is
to
be
ill
disposed
but
he
was
in
general
well
respected
for
he
conducted
himself
with
propriety
in
the
discharge
of
his
ordinary
duties
had
he
married
a
more
amiable
woman
he
might
have
been
made
still
more
respectable
than
he
was
he
might
even
have
been
made
amiable
himself
for
he
was
very
young
when
he
married
and
very
fond
of
his
wife
but
mrs
john
dashwood
was
a
strong
caricature
of
himself
more
narrow
minded
and
selfish
when
he
gave
his
promise
to
his
father
he
meditated
within
himself
to
increase
the
fortunes
of
his
sisters
by
the
present
of
a
thousand
pounds
a
piece
he
then
really
thought
himself
equal
to
it
the
prospect
of
four
thousand
a
year
in
addition
to
his
present
income
besides
the
remaining
half
of
his
own
mother
s
fortune
warmed
his
heart
and
made
him
feel
capable
of
generosity
yes
he
would
give
them
three
thousand
pounds
it
would
be
liberal
and
handsome
it
would
be
enough
to
make
them
completely
easy
three
thousand
pounds
he
could
spare
so
considerable
a
sum
with
little
inconvenience
he
thought
of
it
all
day
long
and
for
many
days
successively
and
he
did
not
repent
no
sooner
was
his
father
s
funeral
over
than
mrs
john
dashwood
without
sending
any
notice
of
her
intention
to
her
mother
in
law
arrived
with
her
child
and
their
attendants
no
one
could
dispute
her
right
to
come
the
house
was
her
husband
s
from
the
moment
of
his
father
s
decease
but
the
indelicacy
of
her
conduct
was
so
much
the
greater
and
to
a
woman
in
mrs
dashwood
s
situation
with
only
common
feelings
must
have
been
highly
unpleasing
but
in
her
mind
there
was
a
sense
of
honor
so
keen
a
generosity
so
romantic
that
any
offence
of
the
kind
by
whomsoever
given
or
received
was
to
her
a
source
of
immovable
disgust
mrs
john
dashwood
had
never
been
a
favourite
with
any
of
her
husband
s
family
but
she
had
had
no
opportunity
till
the
present
of
showing
them
with
how
little
attention
to
the
comfort
of
other
people
she
could
act
when
occasion
required
it
so
acutely
did
mrs
dashwood
feel
this
ungracious
behaviour
and
so
earnestly
did
she
despise
her
daughter
in
law
for
it
that
on
the
arrival
of
the
latter
she
would
have
quitted
the
house
for
ever
had
not
the
entreaty
of
her
eldest
girl
induced
her
first
to
reflect
on
the
propriety
of
going
and
her
own
tender
love
for
all
her
three
children
determined
her
afterwards
to
stay
and
for
their
sakes
avoid
a
breach
with
their
brother
elinor
this
eldest
daughter
whose
advice
was
so
effectual
possessed
a
strength
of
understanding
and
coolness
of
judgment
which
qualified
her
though
only
nineteen
to
be
the
counsellor
of
her
mother
and
enabled
her
frequently
to
counteract
to
the
advantage
of
them
all
that
eagerness
of
mind
in
mrs
dashwood
which
must
generally
have
led
to
imprudence
she
had
an
excellent
heart
her
disposition
was
affectionate
and
her
feelings
were
strong
but
she
knew
how
to
govern
them
it
was
a
knowledge
which
her
mother
had
yet
to
learn
and
which
one
of
her
sisters
had
resolved
never
to
be
taught
marianne
s
abilities
were
in
many
respects
quite
equal
to
elinor
s
she
was
sensible
and
clever
but
eager
in
everything
her
sorrows
her
joys
could
have
no
moderation
she
was
generous
amiable
interesting
she
was
everything
but
prudent
the
resemblance
between
her
and
her
mother
was
strikingly
great
elinor
saw
with
concern
the
excess
of
her
sister
s
sensibility
but
by
mrs
dashwood
it
was
valued
and
cherished
they
encouraged
each
other
now
in
the
violence
of
their
affliction
the
agony
of
grief
which
overpowered
them
at
first
was
voluntarily
renewed
was
sought
for
was
created
again
and
again
they
gave
themselves
up
wholly
to
their
sorrow
seeking
increase
of
wretchedness
in
every
reflection
that
could
afford
it
and
resolved
against
ever
admitting
consolation
in
future
elinor
too
was
deeply
afflicted
but
still
she
could
struggle
she
could
exert
herself
she
could
consult
with
her
brother
could
receive
her
sister
in
law
on
her
arrival
and
treat
her
with
proper
attention
and
could
strive
to
rouse
her
mother
to
similar
exertion
and
encourage
her
to
similar
forbearance
margaret
the
other
sister
was
a
good
humored
well
disposed
girl
but
as
she
had
already
imbibed
a
good
deal
of
marianne
s
romance
without
having
much
of
her
sense
she
did
not
at
thirteen
bid
fair
to
equal
her
sisters
at
a
more
advanced
period
of
life
chapter
ii
mrs
john
dashwood
now
installed
herself
mistress
of
norland
and
her
mother
and
sisters
in
law
were
degraded
to
the
condition
of
visitors
as
such
however
they
were
treated
by
her
with
quiet
civility
and
by
her
husband
with
as
much
kindness
as
he
could
feel
towards
anybody
beyond
himself
his
wife
and
their
child
he
really
pressed
them
with
some
earnestness
to
consider
norland
as
their
home
and
as
no
plan
appeared
so
eligible
to
mrs
dashwood
as
remaining
there
till
she
could
accommodate
herself
with
a
house
in
the
neighbourhood
his
invitation
was
accepted
a
continuance
in
a
place
where
everything
reminded
her
of
former
delight
was
exactly
what
suited
her
mind
in
seasons
of
cheerfulness
no
temper
could
be
more
cheerful
than
hers
or
possess
in
a
greater
degree
that
sanguine
expectation
of
happiness
which
is
happiness
itself
but
in
sorrow
she
must
be
equally
carried
away
by
her
fancy
and
as
far
beyond
consolation
as
in
pleasure
she
was
beyond
alloy
mrs
john
dashwood
did
not
at
all
approve
of
what
her
husband
intended
to
do
for
his
sisters
to
take
three
thousand
pounds
from
the
fortune
of
their
dear
little
boy
would
be
impoverishing
him
to
the
most
dreadful
degree
she
begged
him
to
think
again
on
the
subject
how
could
he
answer
it
to
himself
to
rob
his
child
and
his
only
child
too
of
so
large
a
sum
and
what
possible
claim
could
the
miss
dashwoods
who
were
related
to
him
only
by
half
blood
which
she
considered
as
no
relationship
at
all
have
on
his
generosity
to
so
large
an
amount
it
was
very
well
known
that
no
affection
was
ever
supposed
to
exist
between
the
children
of
any
man
by
different
marriages
and
why
was
he
to
ruin
himself
and
their
poor
little
harry
by
giving
away
all
his
money
to
his
half
sisters
it
was
my
father
s
last
request
to
me
replied
her
husband
that
i
should
assist
his
widow
and
daughters
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
of
i
dare
say
ten
to
one
but
he
was
light
headed
at
the
time
had
he
been
in
his
right
senses
he
could
not
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
begging
you
to
give
away
half
your
fortune
from
your
own
child
he
did
not
stipulate
for
any
particular
sum
my
dear
fanny
he
only
requested
me
in
general
terms
to
assist
them
and
make
their
situation
more
comfortable
than
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
perhaps
it
would
have
been
as
well
if
he
had
left
it
wholly
to
myself
he
could
hardly
suppose
i
should
neglect
them
but
as
he
required
the
promise
i
could
not
do
less
than
give
it
at
least
i
thought
so
at
the
time
the
promise
therefore
was
given
and
must
be
performed
something
must
be
done
for
them
whenever
they
leave
norland
and
settle
in
a
new
home
well
then
let
something
be
done
for
them
but
that
something
need
not
be
three
thousand
pounds
consider
she
added
that
when
the
money
is
once
parted
with
it
never
can
return
your
sisters
will
marry
and
it
will
be
gone
for
ever
if
indeed
it
could
be
restored
to
our
poor
little
boy
why
to
be
sure
said
her
husband
very
gravely
that
would
make
great
difference
the
time
may
come
when
harry
will
regret
that
so
large
a
sum
was
parted
with
if
he
should
have
a
numerous
family
for
instance
it
would
be
a
very
convenient
addition
to
be
sure
it
would
perhaps
then
it
would
be
better
for
all
parties
if
the
sum
were
diminished
one
half
five
hundred
pounds
would
be
a
prodigious
increase
to
their
fortunes
oh
beyond
anything
great
what
brother
on
earth
would
do
half
so
much
for
his
sisters
even
if
really
his
sisters
and
as
it
is
only
half
blood
but
you
have
such
a
generous
spirit
i
would
not
wish
to
do
any
thing
mean
he
replied
one
had
rather
on
such
occasions
do
too
much
than
too
little
no
one
at
least
can
think
i
have
not
done
enough
for
them
even
themselves
they
can
hardly
expect
more
there
is
no
knowing
what
they
may
expect
said
the
lady
but
we
are
not
to
think
of
their
expectations
the
question
is
what
you
can
afford
to
do
certainly
and
i
think
i
may
afford
to
give
them
five
hundred
pounds
a
piece
as
it
is
without
any
addition
of
mine
they
will
each
have
about
three
thousand
pounds
on
their
mother
s
death
a
very
comfortable
fortune
for
any
young
woman
to
be
sure
it
is
and
indeed
it
strikes
me
that
they
can
want
no
addition
at
all
they
will
have
ten
thousand
pounds
divided
amongst
them
if
they
marry
they
will
be
sure
of
doing
well
and
if
they
do
not
they
may
all
live
very
comfortably
together
on
the
interest
of
ten
thousand
pounds
that
is
very
true
and
therefore
i
do
not
know
whether
upon
the
whole
it
would
not
be
more
advisable
to
do
something
for
their
mother
while
she
lives
rather
than
for
them
something
of
the
annuity
kind
i
mean
my
sisters
would
feel
the
good
effects
of
it
as
well
as
herself
a
hundred
a
year
would
make
them
all
perfectly
comfortable
his
wife
hesitated
a
little
however
in
giving
her
consent
to
this
plan
to
be
sure
said
she
it
is
better
than
parting
with
fifteen
hundred
pounds
at
once
but
then
if
mrs
dashwood
should
live
fifteen
years
we
shall
be
completely
taken
in
fifteen
years
my
dear
fanny
her
life
cannot
be
worth
half
that
purchase
certainly
not
but
if
you
observe
people
always
live
for
ever
when
there
is
an
annuity
to
be
paid
them
and
she
is
very
stout
and
healthy
and
hardly
forty
an
annuity
is
a
very
serious
business
it
comes
over
and
over
every
year
and
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
it
you
are
not
aware
of
what
you
are
doing
i
have
known
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
of
annuities
for
my
mother
was
clogged
with
the
payment
of
three
to
old
superannuated
servants
by
my
father
s
will
and
it
is
amazing
how
disagreeable
she
found
it
twice
every
year
these
annuities
were
to
be
paid
and
then
there
was
the
trouble
of
getting
it
to
them
and
then
one
of
them
was
said
to
have
died
and
afterwards
it
turned
out
to
be
no
such
thing
my
mother
was
quite
sick
of
it
her
income
was
not
her
own
she
said
with
such
perpetual
claims
on
it
and
it
was
the
more
unkind
in
my
father
because
otherwise
the
money
would
have
been
entirely
at
my
mother
s
disposal
without
any
restriction
whatever
it
has
given
me
such
an
abhorrence
of
annuities
that
i
am
sure
i
would
not
pin
myself
down
to
the
payment
of
one
for
all
the
world
it
is
certainly
an
unpleasant
thing
replied
mr
dashwood
to
have
those
kind
of
yearly
drains
on
one
s
income
one
s
fortune
as
your
mother
justly
says
is
not
one
s
own
to
be
tied
down
to
the
regular
payment
of
such
a
sum
on
every
rent
day
is
by
no
means
desirable
it
takes
away
one
s
independence
undoubtedly
and
after
all
you
have
no
thanks
for
it
they
think
themselves
secure
you
do
no
more
than
what
is
expected
and
it
raises
no
gratitude
at
all
if
i
were
you
whatever
i
did
should
be
done
at
my
own
discretion
entirely
i
would
not
bind
myself
to
allow
them
any
thing
yearly
it
may
be
very
inconvenient
some
years
to
spare
a
hundred
or
even
fifty
pounds
from
our
own
expenses
i
believe
you
are
right
my
love
it
will
be
better
that
there
should
be
no
annuity
in
the
case
whatever
i
may
give
them
occasionally
will
be
of
far
greater
assistance
than
a
yearly
allowance
because
they
would
only
enlarge
their
style
of
living
if
they
felt
sure
of
a
larger
income
and
would
not
be
sixpence
the
richer
for
it
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
will
certainly
be
much
the
best
way
a
present
of
fifty
pounds
now
and
then
will
prevent
their
ever
being
distressed
for
money
and
will
i
think
be
amply
discharging
my
promise
to
my
father
to
be
sure
it
will
indeed
to
say
the
truth
i
am
convinced
within
myself
that
your
father
had
no
idea
of
your
giving
them
any
money
at
all
the
assistance
he
thought
of
i
dare
say
was
only
such
as
might
be
reasonably
expected
of
you
for
instance
such
as
looking
out
for
a
comfortable
small
house
for
them
helping
them
to
move
their
things
and
sending
them
presents
of
fish
and
game
and
so
forth
whenever
they
are
in
season
i
ll
lay
my
life
that
he
meant
nothing
farther
indeed
it
would
be
very
strange
and
unreasonable
if
he
did
do
but
consider
my
dear
mr
dashwood
how
excessively
comfortable
your
mother
in
law
and
her
daughters
may
live
on
the
interest
of
seven
thousand
pounds
besides
the
thousand
pounds
belonging
to
each
of
the
girls
which
brings
them
in
fifty
pounds
a
year
a
piece
and
of
course
they
will
pay
their
mother
for
their
board
out
of
it
altogether
they
will
have
five
hundred
a
year
amongst
them
and
what
on
earth
can
four
women
want
for
more
than
that
they
will
live
so
cheap
their
housekeeping
will
be
nothing
at
all
they
will
have
no
carriage
no
horses
and
hardly
any
servants
they
will
keep
no
company
and
can
have
no
expenses
of
any
kind
only
conceive
how
comfortable
they
will
be
five
hundred
a
year
i
am
sure
i
cannot
imagine
how
they
will
spend
half
of
it
and
as
to
your
giving
them
more
it
is
quite
absurd
to
think
of
it
they
will
be
much
more
able
to
give
you
something
upon
my
word
said
mr
dashwood
i
believe
you
are
perfectly
right
my
father
certainly
could
mean
nothing
more
by
his
request
to
me
than
what
you
say
i
clearly
understand
it
now
and
i
will
strictly
fulfil
my
engagement
by
such
acts
of
assistance
and
kindness
to
them
as
you
have
described
when
my
mother
removes
into
another
house
my
services
shall
be
readily
given
to
accommodate
her
as
far
as
i
can
some
little
present
of
furniture
too
may
be
acceptable
then
certainly
returned
mrs
john
dashwood
but
however
one
thing
must
be
considered
when
your
father
and
mother
moved
to
norland
though
the
furniture
of
stanhill
was
sold
all
the
china
plate
and
linen
was
saved
and
is
now
left
to
your
mother
her
house
will
therefore
be
almost
completely
fitted
up
as
soon
as
she
takes
it
that
is
a
material
consideration
undoubtedly
a
valuable
legacy
indeed
and
yet
some
of
the
plate
would
have
been
a
very
pleasant
addition
to
our
own
stock
here
yes
and
the
set
of
breakfast
china
is
twice
as
handsome
as
what
belongs
to
this
house
a
great
deal
too
handsome
in
my
opinion
for
any
place
they
can
ever
afford
to
live
in
but
however
so
it
is
your
father
thought
only
of
them
and
i
must
say
this
that
you
owe
no
particular
gratitude
to
him
nor
attention
to
his
wishes
for
we
very
well
know
that
if
he
could
he
would
have
left
almost
everything
in
the
world
to
them
this
argument
was
irresistible
it
gave
to
his
intentions
whatever
of
decision
was
wanting
before
and
he
finally
resolved
that
it
would
be
absolutely
unnecessary
if
not
highly
indecorous
to
do
more
for
the
widow
and
children
of
his
father
than
such
kind
of
neighbourly
acts
as
his
own
wife
pointed
out
chapter
iii
mrs
dashwood
remained
at
norland
several
months
not
from
any
disinclination
to
move
when
the
sight
of
every
well
known
spot
ceased
to
raise
the
violent
emotion
which
it
produced
for
a
while
for
when
her
spirits
began
to
revive
and
her
mind
became
capable
of
some
other
exertion
than
that
of
heightening
its
affliction
by
melancholy
remembrances
she
was
impatient
to
be
gone
and
indefatigable
in
her
inquiries
for
a
suitable
dwelling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
norland
for
to
remove
far
from
that
beloved
spot
was
impossible
but
she
could
hear
of
no
situation
that
at
once
answered
her
notions
of
comfort
and
ease
and
suited
the
prudence
of
her
eldest
daughter
whose
steadier
judgment
rejected
several
houses
as
too
large
for
their
income
which
her
mother
would
have
approved
[illustration
i
cannot
imagine
how
they
will
spend
half
of
it
]
mrs
dashwood
had
been
informed
by
her
husband
of
the
solemn
promise
on
the
part
of
his
son
in
their
favour
which
gave
comfort
to
his
last
earthly
reflections
she
doubted
the
sincerity
of
this
assurance
no
more
than
he
had
doubted
it
himself
and
she
thought
of
it
for
her
daughters
sake
with
satisfaction
though
as
for
herself
she
was
persuaded
that
a
much
smaller
provision
than
7000l
would
support
her
in
affluence
for
their
brother
s
sake
too
for
the
sake
of
his
own
heart
she
rejoiced
and
she
reproached
herself
for
being
unjust
to
his
merit
before
in
believing
him
incapable
of
generosity
his
attentive
behaviour
to
herself
and
his
sisters
convinced
her
that
their
welfare
was
dear
to
him
and
for
a
long
time
she
firmly
relied
on
the
liberality
of
his
intentions
the
contempt
which
she
had
very
early
in
their
acquaintance
felt
for
her
daughter
in
law
was
very
much
increased
by
the
farther
knowledge
of
her
character
which
half
a
year
s
residence
in
her
family
afforded
and
perhaps
in
spite
of
every
consideration
of
politeness
or
maternal
affection
on
the
side
of
the
former
the
two
ladies
might
have
found
it
impossible
to
have
lived
together
so
long
had
not
a
particular
circumstance
occurred
to
give
still
greater
eligibility
according
to
the
opinions
of
mrs
dashwood
to
her
daughters
continuance
at
norland
this
circumstance
was
a
growing
attachment
between
her
eldest
girl
and
the
brother
of
mrs
john
dashwood
a
gentlemanlike
and
pleasing
young
man
who
was
introduced
to
their
acquaintance
soon
after
his
sister
s
establishment
at
norland
and
who
had
since
spent
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
there
some
mothers
might
have
encouraged
the
intimacy
from
motives
of
interest
for
edward
ferrars
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
man
who
had
died
very
rich
and
some
might
have
repressed
it
from
motives
of
prudence
for
except
a
trifling
sum
the
whole
of
his
fortune
depended
on
the
will
of
his
mother
but
mrs
dashwood
was
alike
uninfluenced
by
either
consideration
it
was
enough
for
her
that
he
appeared
to
be
amiable
that
he
loved
her
daughter
and
that
elinor
returned
the
partiality
it
was
contrary
to
every
doctrine
of
her
s
that
difference
of
fortune
should
keep
any
couple
asunder
who
were
attracted
by
resemblance
of
disposition
and
that
elinor
s
merit
should
not
be
acknowledged
by
every
one
who
knew
her
was
to
her
comprehension
impossible
edward
ferrars
was
not
recommended
to
their
good
opinion
by
any
peculiar
graces
of
person
or
address
he
was
not
handsome
and
his
manners
required
intimacy
to
make
them
pleasing
he
was
too
diffident
to
do
justice
to
himself
but
when
his
natural
shyness
was
overcome
his
behaviour
gave
every
indication
of
an
open
affectionate
heart
his
understanding
was
good
and
his
education
had
given
it
solid
improvement
but
he
was
neither
fitted
by
abilities
nor
disposition
to
answer
the
wishes
of
his
mother
and
sister
who
longed
to
see
him
distinguished
as
they
hardly
knew
what
they
wanted
him
to
make
a
fine
figure
in
the
world
in
some
manner
or
other
his
mother
wished
to
interest
him
in
political
concerns
to
get
him
into
parliament
or
to
see
him
connected
with
some
of
the
great
men
of
the
day
mrs
john
dashwood
wished
it
likewise
but
in
the
mean
while
till
one
of
these
superior
blessings
could
be
attained
it
would
have
quieted
her
ambition
to
see
him
driving
a
barouche
but
edward
had
no
turn
for
great
men
or
barouches
all
his
wishes
centered
in
domestic
comfort
and
the
quiet
of
private
life
fortunately
he
had
a
younger
brother
who
was
more
promising
edward
had
been
staying
several
weeks
in
the
house
before
he
engaged
much
of
mrs
dashwood
s
attention
for
she
was
at
that
time
in
such
affliction
as
rendered
her
careless
of
surrounding
objects
she
saw
only
that
he
was
quiet
and
unobtrusive
and
she
liked
him
for
it
he
did
not
disturb
the
wretchedness
of
her
mind
by
ill
timed
conversation
she
was
first
called
to
observe
and
approve
him
farther
by
a
reflection
which
elinor
chanced
one
day
to
make
on
the
difference
between
him
and
his
sister
it
was
a
contrast
which
recommended
him
most
forcibly
to
her
mother
it
is
enough
said
she
to
say
that
he
is
unlike
fanny
is
enough
it
implies
everything
amiable
i
love
him
already
i
think
you
will
like
him
said
elinor
when
you
know
more
of
him
like
him
replied
her
mother
with
a
smile
i
feel
no
sentiment
of
approbation
inferior
to
love
you
may
esteem
him
i
have
never
yet
known
what
it
was
to
separate
esteem
and
love
mrs
dashwood
now
took
pains
to
get
acquainted
with
him
her
manners
were
attaching
and
soon
banished
his
reserve
she
speedily
comprehended
all
his
merits
the
persuasion
of
his
regard
for
elinor
perhaps
assisted
her
penetration
but
she
really
felt
assured
of
his
worth
and
even
that
quietness
of
manner
which
militated
against
all
her
established
ideas
of
what
a
young
man
s
address
ought
to
be
was
no
longer
uninteresting
when
she
knew
his
heart
to
be
warm
and
his
temper
affectionate
no
sooner
did
she
perceive
any
symptom
of
love
in
his
behaviour
to
elinor
than
she
considered
their
serious
attachment
as
certain
and
looked
forward
to
their
marriage
as
rapidly
approaching
in
a
few
months
my
dear
marianne
said
she
elinor
will
in
all
probability
be
settled
for
life
we
shall
miss
her
but
she
will
be
happy
oh
mamma
how
shall
we
do
without
her
my
love
it
will
be
scarcely
a
separation
we
shall
live
within
a
few
miles
of
each
other
and
shall
meet
every
day
of
our
lives
you
will
gain
a
brother
a
real
affectionate
brother
i
have
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
of
edward
s
heart
but
you
look
grave
marianne
do
you
disapprove
your
sister
s
choice
perhaps
said
marianne
i
may
consider
it
with
some
surprise
edward
is
very
amiable
and
i
love
him
tenderly
but
yet
he
is
not
the
kind
of
young
man
there
is
something
wanting
his
figure
is
not
striking
it
has
none
of
that
grace
which
i
should
expect
in
the
man
who
could
seriously
attach
my
sister
his
eyes
want
all
that
spirit
that
fire
which
at
once
announce
virtue
and
intelligence
and
besides
all
this
i
am
afraid
mamma
he
has
no
real
taste
music
seems
scarcely
to
attract
him
and
though
he
admires
elinor
s
drawings
very
much
it
is
not
the
admiration
of
a
person
who
can
understand
their
worth
it
is
evident
in
spite
of
his
frequent
attention
to
her
while
she
draws
that
in
fact
he
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
he
admires
as
a
lover
not
as
a
connoisseur
to
satisfy
me
those
characters
must
be
united
i
could
not
be
happy
with
a
man
whose
taste
did
not
in
every
point
coincide
with
my
own
he
must
enter
into
all
my
feelings
the
same
books
the
same
music
must
charm
us
both
oh
mama
how
spiritless
how
tame
was
edward
s
manner
in
reading
to
us
last
night
i
felt
for
my
sister
most
severely
yet
she
bore
it
with
so
much
composure
she
seemed
scarcely
to
notice
it
i
could
hardly
keep
my
seat
to
hear
those
beautiful
lines
which
have
frequently
almost
driven
me
wild
pronounced
with
such
impenetrable
calmness
such
dreadful
indifference
he
would
certainly
have
done
more
justice
to
simple
and
elegant
prose
i
thought
so
at
the
time
but
you
would
give
him
cowper
nay
mamma
if
he
is
not
to
be
animated
by
cowper
but
we
must
allow
for
difference
of
taste
elinor
has
not
my
feelings
and
therefore
she
may
overlook
it
and
be
happy
with
him
but
it
would
have
broke
my
heart
had
i
loved
him
to
hear
him
read
with
so
little
sensibility
mama
the
more
i
know
of
the
world
the
more
am
i
convinced
that
i
shall
never
see
a
man
whom
i
can
really
love
i
require
so
much
he
must
have
all
edward
s
virtues
and
his
person
and
manners
must
ornament
his
goodness
with
every
possible
charm
remember
my
love
that
you
are
not
seventeen
it
is
yet
too
early
in
life
to
despair
of
such
a
happiness
why
should
you
be
less
fortunate
than
your
mother
in
one
circumstance
only
my
marianne
may
your
destiny
be
different
from
her
s
chapter
iv
what
a
pity
it
is
elinor
said
marianne
that
edward
should
have
no
taste
for
drawing
no
taste
for
drawing
replied
elinor
why
should
you
think
so
he
does
not
draw
himself
indeed
but
he
has
great
pleasure
in
seeing
the
performances
of
other
people
and
i
assure
you
he
is
by
no
means
deficient
in
natural
taste
though
he
has
not
had
opportunities
of
improving
it
had
he
ever
been
in
the
way
of
learning
i
think
he
would
have
drawn
very
well
he
distrusts
his
own
judgment
in
such
matters
so
much
that
he
is
always
unwilling
to
give
his
opinion
on
any
picture
but
he
has
an
innate
propriety
and
simplicity
of
taste
which
in
general
direct
him
perfectly
right
marianne
was
afraid
of
offending
and
said
no
more
on
the
subject
but
the
kind
of
approbation
which
elinor
described
as
excited
in
him
by
the
drawings
of
other
people
was
very
far
from
that
rapturous
delight
which
in
her
opinion
could
alone
be
called
taste
yet
though
smiling
within
herself
at
the
mistake
she
honoured
her
sister
for
that
blind
partiality
to
edward
which
produced
it
i
hope
marianne
continued
elinor
you
do
not
consider
him
as
deficient
in
general
taste
indeed
i
think
i
may
say
that
you
cannot
for
your
behaviour
to
him
is
perfectly
cordial
and
if
that
were
your
opinion
i
am
sure
you
could
never
be
civil
to
him
marianne
hardly
knew
what
to
say
she
would
not
wound
the
feelings
of
her
sister
on
any
account
and
yet
to
say
what
she
did
not
believe
was
impossible
at
length
she
replied
do
not
be
offended
elinor
if
my
praise
of
him
is
not
in
every
thing
equal
to
your
sense
of
his
merits
i
have
not
had
so
many
opportunities
of
estimating
the
minuter
propensities
of
his
mind
his
inclinations
and
tastes
as
you
have
but
i
have
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
of
his
goodness
and
sense
i
think
him
every
thing
that
is
worthy
and
amiable
i
am
sure
replied
elinor
with
a
smile
that
his
dearest
friends
could
not
be
dissatisfied
with
such
commendation
as
that
i
do
not
perceive
how
you
could
express
yourself
more
warmly
marianne
was
rejoiced
to
find
her
sister
so
easily
pleased
of
his
sense
and
his
goodness
continued
elinor
no
one
can
i
think
be
in
doubt
who
has
seen
him
often
enough
to
engage
him
in
unreserved
conversation
the
excellence
of
his
understanding
and
his
principles
can
be
concealed
only
by
that
shyness
which
too
often
keeps
him
silent
you
know
enough
of
him
to
do
justice
to
his
solid
worth
but
of
his
minuter
propensities
as
you
call
them
you
have
from
peculiar
circumstances
been
kept
more
ignorant
than
myself
he
and
i
have
been
at
times
thrown
a
good
deal
together
while
you
have
been
wholly
engrossed
on
the
most
affectionate
principle
by
my
mother
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
have
studied
his
sentiments
and
heard
his
opinion
on
subjects
of
literature
and
taste
and
upon
the
whole
i
venture
to
pronounce
that
his
mind
is
well
informed
enjoyment
of
books
exceedingly
great
his
imagination
lively
his
observation
just
and
correct
and
his
taste
delicate
and
pure
his
abilities
in
every
respect
improve
as
much
upon
acquaintance
as
his
manners
and
person
at
first
sight
his
address
is
certainly
not
striking
and
his
person
can
hardly
be
called
handsome
till
the
expression
of
his
eyes
which
are
uncommonly
good
and
the
general
sweetness
of
his
countenance
is
perceived
at
present
i
know
him
so
well
that
i
think
him
really
handsome
or
at
least
almost
so
what
say
you
marianne
i
shall
very
soon
think
him
handsome
elinor
if
i
do
not
now
when
you
tell
me
to
love
him
as
a
brother
i
shall
no
more
see
imperfection
in
his
face
than
i
now
do
in
his
heart
elinor
started
at
this
declaration
and
was
sorry
for
the
warmth
she
had
been
betrayed
into
in
speaking
of
him
she
felt
that
edward
stood
very
high
in
her
opinion
she
believed
the
regard
to
be
mutual
but
she
required
greater
certainty
of
it
to
make
marianne
s
conviction
of
their
attachment
agreeable
to
her
she
knew
that
what
marianne
and
her
mother
conjectured
one
moment
they
believed
the
next
that
with
them
to
wish
was
to
hope
and
to
hope
was
to
expect
she
tried
to
explain
the
real
state
of
the
case
to
her
sister
i
do
not
attempt
to
deny
said
she
that
i
think
very
highly
of
him
that
i
greatly
esteem
that
i
like
him
marianne
here
burst
forth
with
indignation
esteem
him
like
him
cold
hearted
elinor
oh
worse
than
cold
hearted
ashamed
of
being
otherwise
use
those
words
again
and
i
will
leave
the
room
this
moment
elinor
could
not
help
laughing
excuse
me
said
she
and
be
assured
that
i
meant
no
offence
to
you
by
speaking
in
so
quiet
a
way
of
my
own
feelings
believe
them
to
be
stronger
than
i
have
declared
believe
them
in
short
to
be
such
as
his
merit
and
the
suspicion
the
hope
of
his
affection
for
me
may
warrant
without
imprudence
or
folly
but
farther
than
this
you
must
not
believe
i
am
by
no
means
assured
of
his
regard
for
me
there
are
moments
when
the
extent
of
it
seems
doubtful
and
till
his
sentiments
are
fully
known
you
cannot
wonder
at
my
wishing
to
avoid
any
encouragement
of
my
own
partiality
by
believing
or
calling
it
more
than
it
is
in
my
heart
i
feel
little
scarcely
any
doubt
of
his
preference
but
there
are
other
points
to
be
considered
besides
his
inclination
he
is
very
far
from
being
independent
what
his
mother
really
is
we
cannot
know
but
from
fanny
s
occasional
mention
of
her
conduct
and
opinions
we
have
never
been
disposed
to
think
her
amiable
and
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
edward
is
not
himself
aware
that
there
would
be
many
difficulties
in
his
way
if
he
were
to
wish
to
marry
a
woman
who
had
not
either
a
great
fortune
or
high
rank
marianne
was
astonished
to
find
how
much
the
imagination
of
her
mother
and
herself
had
outstripped
the
truth
and
you
really
are
not
engaged
to
him
said
she
yet
it
certainly
soon
will
happen
but
two
advantages
will
proceed
from
this
delay
i
shall
not
lose
you
so
soon
and
edward
will
have
greater
opportunity
of
improving
that
natural
taste
for
your
favourite
pursuit
which
must
be
so
indispensably
necessary
to
your
future
felicity
oh
if
he
should
be
so
far
stimulated
by
your
genius
as
to
learn
to
draw
himself
how
delightful
it
would
be
elinor
had
given
her
real
opinion
to
her
sister
she
could
not
consider
her
partiality
for
edward
in
so
prosperous
a
state
as
marianne
had
believed
it
there
was
at
times
a
want
of
spirits
about
him
which
if
it
did
not
denote
indifference
spoke
of
something
almost
as
unpromising
a
doubt
of
her
regard
supposing
him
to
feel
it
need
not
give
him
more
than
inquietude
it
would
not
be
likely
to
produce
that
dejection
of
mind
which
frequently
attended
him
a
more
reasonable
cause
might
be
found
in
the
dependent
situation
which
forbade
the
indulgence
of
his
affection
she
knew
that
his
mother
neither
behaved
to
him
so
as
to
make
his
home
comfortable
at
present
nor
to
give
him
any
assurance
that
he
might
form
a
home
for
himself
without
strictly
attending
to
her
views
for
his
aggrandizement
with
such
a
knowledge
as
this
it
was
impossible
for
elinor
to
feel
easy
on
the
subject
she
was
far
from
depending
on
that
result
of
his
preference
of
her
which
her
mother
and
sister
still
considered
as
certain
nay
the
longer
they
were
together
the
more
doubtful
seemed
the
nature
of
his
regard
and
sometimes
for
a
few
painful
minutes
she
believed
it
to
be
no
more
than
friendship
but
whatever
might
really
be
its
limits
it
was
enough
when
perceived
by
his
sister
to
make
her
uneasy
and
at
the
same
time
which
was
still
more
common
to
make
her
uncivil
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
affronting
her
mother
in
law
on
the
occasion
talking
to
her
so
expressively
of
her
brother
s
great
expectations
of
mrs
ferrars
s
resolution
that
both
her
sons
should
marry
well
and
of
the
danger
attending
any
young
woman
who
attempted
to
draw
him
in
that
mrs
dashwood
could
neither
pretend
to
be
unconscious
nor
endeavor
to
be
calm
she
gave
her
an
answer
which
marked
her
contempt
and
instantly
left
the
room
resolving
that
whatever
might
be
the
inconvenience
or
expense
of
so
sudden
a
removal
her
beloved
elinor
should
not
be
exposed
another
week
to
such
insinuations
in
this
state
of
her
spirits
a
letter
was
delivered
to
her
from
the
post
which
contained
a
proposal
particularly
well
timed
it
was
the
offer
of
a
small
house
on
very
easy
terms
belonging
to
a
relation
of
her
own
a
gentleman
of
consequence
and
property
in
devonshire
the
letter
was
from
this
gentleman
himself
and
written
in
the
true
spirit
of
friendly
accommodation
he
understood
that
she
was
in
need
of
a
dwelling
and
though
the
house
he
now
offered
her
was
merely
a
cottage
he
assured
her
that
everything
should
be
done
to
it
which
she
might
think
necessary
if
the
situation
pleased
her
he
earnestly
pressed
her
after
giving
the
particulars
of
the
house
and
garden
to
come
with
her
daughters
to
barton
park
the
place
of
his
own
residence
from
whence
she
might
judge
herself
whether
barton
cottage
for
the
houses
were
in
the
same
parish
could
by
any
alteration
be
made
comfortable
to
her
he
seemed
really
anxious
to
accommodate
them
and
the
whole
of
his
letter
was
written
in
so
friendly
a
style
as
could
not
fail
of
giving
pleasure
to
his
cousin
more
especially
at
a
moment
when
she
was
suffering
under
the
cold
and
unfeeling
behaviour
of
her
nearer
connections
she
needed
no
time
for
deliberation
or
inquiry
her
resolution
was
formed
as
she
read
the
situation
of
barton
in
a
county
so
far
distant
from
sussex
as
devonshire
which
but
a
few
hours
before
would
have
been
a
sufficient
objection
to
outweigh
every
possible
advantage
belonging
to
the
place
was
now
its
first
recommendation
to
quit
the
neighbourhood
of
norland
was
no
longer
an
evil
it
was
an
object
of
desire
it
was
a
blessing
in
comparison
of
the
misery
of
continuing
her
daughter
in
law
s
guest
and
to
remove
for
ever
from
that
beloved
place
would
be
less
painful
than
to
inhabit
or
visit
it
while
such
a
woman
was
its
mistress
she
instantly
wrote
sir
john
middleton
her
acknowledgment
of
his
kindness
and
her
acceptance
of
his
proposal
and
then
hastened
to
show
both
letters
to
her
daughters
that
she
might
be
secure
of
their
approbation
before
her
answer
were
sent
elinor
had
always
thought
it
would
be
more
prudent
for
them
to
settle
at
some
distance
from
norland
than
immediately
amongst
their
present
acquaintance
on
that
head
therefore
it
was
not
for
her
to
oppose
her
mother
s
intention
of
removing
into
devonshire
the
house
too
as
described
by
sir
john
was
on
so
simple
a
scale
and
the
rent
so
uncommonly
moderate
as
to
leave
her
no
right
of
objection
on
either
point
and
therefore
though
it
was
not
a
plan
which
brought
any
charm
to
her
fancy
though
it
was
a
removal
from
the
vicinity
of
norland
beyond
her
wishes
she
made
no
attempt
to
dissuade
her
mother
from
sending
a
letter
of
acquiescence
chapter
v
no
sooner
was
her
answer
dispatched
than
mrs
dashwood
indulged
herself
in
the
pleasure
of
announcing
to
her
son
in
law
and
his
wife
that
she
was
provided
with
a
house
and
should
incommode
them
no
longer
than
till
every
thing
were
ready
for
her
inhabiting
it
they
heard
her
with
surprise
mrs
john
dashwood
said
nothing
but
her
husband
civilly
hoped
that
she
would
not
be
settled
far
from
norland
she
had
great
satisfaction
in
replying
that
she
was
going
into
devonshire
edward
turned
hastily
towards
her
on
hearing
this
and
in
a
voice
of
surprise
and
concern
which
required
no
explanation
to
her
repeated
devonshire
are
you
indeed
going
there
so
far
from
hence
and
to
what
part
of
it
she
explained
the
situation
it
was
within
four
miles
northward
of
exeter
it
is
but
a
cottage
she
continued
but
i
hope
to
see
many
of
my
friends
in
it
a
room
or
two
can
easily
be
added
and
if
my
friends
find
no
difficulty
in
travelling
so
far
to
see
me
i
am
sure
i
will
find
none
in
accommodating
them
she
concluded
with
a
very
kind
invitation
to
mr
and
mrs
john
dashwood
to
visit
her
at
barton
and
to
edward
she
gave
one
with
still
greater
affection
though
her
late
conversation
with
her
daughter
in
law
had
made
her
resolve
on
remaining
at
norland
no
longer
than
was
unavoidable
it
had
not
produced
the
smallest
effect
on
her
in
that
point
to
which
it
principally
tended
to
separate
edward
and
elinor
was
as
far
from
being
her
object
as
ever
and
she
wished
to
show
mrs
john
dashwood
by
this
pointed
invitation
to
her
brother
how
totally
she
disregarded
her
disapprobation
of
the
match
mr
john
dashwood
told
his
mother
again
and
again
how
exceedingly
sorry
he
was
that
she
had
taken
a
house
at
such
a
distance
from
norland
as
to
prevent
his
being
of
any
service
to
her
in
removing
her
furniture
he
really
felt
conscientiously
vexed
on
the
occasion
for
the
very
exertion
to
which
he
had
limited
the
performance
of
his
promise
to
his
father
was
by
this
arrangement
rendered
impracticable
the
furniture
was
all
sent
around
by
water
it
chiefly
consisted
of
household
linen
plate
china
and
books
with
a
handsome
pianoforte
of
marianne
s
mrs
john
dashwood
saw
the
packages
depart
with
a
sigh
she
could
not
help
feeling
it
hard
that
as
mrs
dashwood
s
income
would
be
so
trifling
in
comparison
with
their
own
she
should
have
any
handsome
article
of
furniture
mrs
dashwood
took
the
house
for
a
twelvemonth
it
was
ready
furnished
and
she
might
have
immediate
possession
no
difficulty
arose
on
either
side
in
the
agreement
and
she
waited
only
for
the
disposal
of
her
effects
at
norland
and
to
determine
her
future
household
before
she
set
off
for
the
west
and
this
as
she
was
exceedingly
rapid
in
the
performance
of
everything
that
interested
her
was
soon
done
the
horses
which
were
left
her
by
her
husband
had
been
sold
soon
after
his
death
and
an
opportunity
now
offering
of
disposing
of
her
carriage
she
agreed
to
sell
that
likewise
at
the
earnest
advice
of
her
eldest
daughter
for
the
comfort
of
her
children
had
she
consulted
only
her
own
wishes
she
would
have
kept
it
but
the
discretion
of
elinor
prevailed
her
wisdom
too
limited
the
number
of
their
servants
to
three
two
maids
and
a
man
with
whom
they
were
speedily
provided
from
amongst
those
who
had
formed
their
establishment
at
norland
the
man
and
one
of
the
maids
were
sent
off
immediately
into
devonshire
to
prepare
the
house
for
their
mistress
s
arrival
for
as
lady
middleton
was
entirely
unknown
to
mrs
dashwood
she
preferred
going
directly
to
the
cottage
to
being
a
visitor
at
barton
park
and
she
relied
so
undoubtingly
on
sir
john
s
description
of
the
house
as
to
feel
no
curiosity
to
examine
it
herself
till
she
entered
it
as
her
own
her
eagerness
to
be
gone
from
norland
was
preserved
from
diminution
by
the
evident
satisfaction
of
her
daughter
in
law
in
the
prospect
of
her
removal
a
satisfaction
which
was
but
feebly
attempted
to
be
concealed
under
a
cold
invitation
to
her
to
defer
her
departure
now
was
the
time
when
her
son
in
law
s
promise
to
his
father
might
with
particular
propriety
be
fulfilled
since
he
had
neglected
to
do
it
on
first
coming
to
the
estate
their
quitting
his
house
might
be
looked
on
as
the
most
suitable
period
for
its
accomplishment
but
mrs
dashwood
began
shortly
to
give
over
every
hope
of
the
kind
and
to
be
convinced
from
the
general
drift
of
his
discourse
that
his
assistance
extended
no
farther
than
their
maintenance
for
six
months
at
norland
he
so
frequently
talked
of
the
increasing
expenses
of
housekeeping
and
of
the
perpetual
demands
upon
his
purse
which
a
man
of
any
consequence
in
the
world
was
beyond
calculation
exposed
to
that
he
seemed
rather
to
stand
in
need
of
more
money
himself
than
to
have
any
design
of
giving
money
away
in
a
very
few
weeks
from
the
day
which
brought
sir
john
middleton
s
first
letter
to
norland
every
thing
was
so
far
settled
in
their
future
abode
as
to
enable
mrs
dashwood
and
her
daughters
to
begin
their
journey
many
were
the
tears
shed
by
them
in
their
last
adieus
to
a
place
so
much
beloved
dear
dear
norland
said
marianne
as
she
wandered
alone
before
the
house
on
the
last
evening
of
their
being
there
when
shall
i
cease
to
regret
you
when
learn
to
feel
a
home
elsewhere
oh
happy
house
could
you
know
what
i
suffer
in
now
viewing
you
from
this
spot
from
whence
perhaps
i
may
view
you
no
more
and
you
ye
well
known
trees
but
you
will
continue
the
same
no
leaf
will
decay
because
we
are
removed
nor
any
branch
become
motionless
although
we
can
observe
you
no
longer
no
you
will
continue
the
same
unconscious
of
the
pleasure
or
the
regret
you
occasion
and
insensible
of
any
change
in
those
who
walk
under
your
shade
but
who
will
remain
to
enjoy
you
chapter
vi
the
first
part
of
their
journey
was
performed
in
too
melancholy
a
disposition
to
be
otherwise
than
tedious
and
unpleasant
but
as
they
drew
towards
the
end
of
it
their
interest
in
the
appearance
of
a
country
which
they
were
to
inhabit
overcame
their
dejection
and
a
view
of
barton
valley
as
they
entered
it
gave
them
cheerfulness
it
was
a
pleasant
fertile
spot
well
wooded
and
rich
in
pasture
after
winding
along
it
for
more
than
a
mile
they
reached
their
own
house
a
small
green
court
was
the
whole
of
its
demesne
in
front
and
a
neat
wicket
gate
admitted
them
into
it
as
a
house
barton
cottage
though
small
was
comfortable
and
compact
but
as
a
cottage
it
was
defective
for
the
building
was
regular
the
roof
was
tiled
the
window
shutters
were
not
painted
green
nor
were
the
walls
covered
with
honeysuckles
a
narrow
passage
led
directly
through
the
house
into
the
garden
behind
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
was
a
sitting
room
about
sixteen
feet
square
and
beyond
them
were
the
offices
and
the
stairs
four
bedrooms
and
two
garrets
formed
the
rest
of
the
house
it
had
not
been
built
many
years
and
was
in
good
repair
in
comparison
of
norland
it
was
poor
and
small
indeed
but
the
tears
which
recollection
called
forth
as
they
entered
the
house
were
soon
dried
away
they
were
cheered
by
the
joy
of
the
servants
on
their
arrival
and
each
for
the
sake
of
the
others
resolved
to
appear
happy
it
was
very
early
in
september
the
season
was
fine
and
from
first
seeing
the
place
under
the
advantage
of
good
weather
they
received
an
impression
in
its
favour
which
was
of
material
service
in
recommending
it
to
their
lasting
approbation
the
situation
of
the
house
was
good
high
hills
rose
immediately
behind
and
at
no
great
distance
on
each
side
some
of
which
were
open
downs
the
others
cultivated
and
woody
the
village
of
barton
was
chiefly
on
one
of
these
hills
and
formed
a
pleasant
view
from
the
cottage
windows
the
prospect
in
front
was
more
extensive
it
commanded
the
whole
of
the
valley
and
reached
into
the
country
beyond
the
hills
which
surrounded
the
cottage
terminated
the
valley
in
that
direction
under
another
name
and
in
another
course
it
branched
out
again
between
two
of
the
steepest
of
them
with
the
size
and
furniture
of
the
house
mrs
dashwood
was
upon
the
whole
well
satisfied
for
though
her
former
style
of
life
rendered
many
additions
to
the
latter
indispensable
yet
to
add
and
improve
was
a
delight
to
her
and
she
had
at
this
time
ready
money
enough
to
supply
all
that
was
wanted
of
greater
elegance
to
the
apartments
as
for
the
house
itself
to
be
sure
said
she
it
is
too
small
for
our
family
but
we
will
make
ourselves
tolerably
comfortable
for
the
present
as
it
is
too
late
in
the
year
for
improvements
perhaps
in
the
spring
if
i
have
plenty
of
money
as
i
dare
say
i
shall
we
may
think
about
building
these
parlors
are
both
too
small
for
such
parties
of
our
friends
as
i
hope
to
see
often
collected
here
and
i
have
some
thoughts
of
throwing
the
passage
into
one
of
them
with
perhaps
a
part
of
the
other
and
so
leave
the
remainder
of
that
other
for
an
entrance
this
with
a
new
drawing
room
which
may
be
easily
added
and
a
bed
chamber
and
garret
above
will
make
it
a
very
snug
little
cottage
i
could
wish
the
stairs
were
handsome
but
one
must
not
expect
every
thing
though
i
suppose
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
widen
them
i
shall
see
how
much
i
am
before
hand
with
the
world
in
the
spring
and
we
will
plan
our
improvements
accordingly
in
the
mean
time
till
all
these
alterations
could
be
made
from
the
savings
of
an
income
of
five
hundred
a
year
by
a
woman
who
never
saved
in
her
life
they
were
wise
enough
to
be
contented
with
the
house
as
it
was
and
each
of
them
was
busy
in
arranging
their
particular
concerns
and
endeavoring
by
placing
around
them
books
and
other
possessions
to
form
themselves
a
home
marianne
s
pianoforte
was
unpacked
and
properly
disposed
of
and
elinor
s
drawings
were
affixed
to
the
walls
of
their
sitting
room
in
such
employments
as
these
they
were
interrupted
soon
after
breakfast
the
next
day
by
the
entrance
of
their
landlord
who
called
to
welcome
them
to
barton
and
to
offer
them
every
accommodation
from
his
own
house
and
garden
in
which
theirs
might
at
present
be
deficient
sir
john
middleton
was
a
good
looking
man
about
forty
he
had
formerly
visited
at
stanhill
but
it
was
too
long
for
his
young
cousins
to
remember
him
his
countenance
was
thoroughly
good
humoured
and
his
manners
were
as
friendly
as
the
style
of
his
letter
their
arrival
seemed
to
afford
him
real
satisfaction
and
their
comfort
to
be
an
object
of
real
solicitude
to
him
he
said
much
of
his
earnest
desire
of
their
living
in
the
most
sociable
terms
with
his
family
and
pressed
them
so
cordially
to
dine
at
barton
park
every
day
till
they
were
better
settled
at
home
that
though
his
entreaties
were
carried
to
a
point
of
perseverance
beyond
civility
they
could
not
give
offence
his
kindness
was
not
confined
to
words
for
within
an
hour
after
he
left
them
a
large
basket
full
of
garden
stuff
and
fruit
arrived
from
the
park
which
was
followed
before
the
end
of
the
day
by
a
present
of
game
he
insisted
moreover
on
conveying
all
their
letters
to
and
from
the
post
for
them
and
would
not
be
denied
the
satisfaction
of
sending
them
his
newspaper
every
day
lady
middleton
had
sent
a
very
civil
message
by
him
denoting
her
intention
of
waiting
on
mrs
dashwood
as
soon
as
she
could
be
assured
that
her
visit
would
be
no
inconvenience
and
as
this
message
was
answered
by
an
invitation
equally
polite
her
ladyship
was
introduced
to
them
the
next
day
[illustration
so
shy
before
company
]
they
were
of
course
very
anxious
to
see
a
person
on
whom
so
much
of
their
comfort
at
barton
must
depend
and
the
elegance
of
her
appearance
was
favourable
to
their
wishes
lady
middleton
was
not
more
than
six
or
seven
and
twenty
her
face
was
handsome
her
figure
tall
and
striking
and
her
address
graceful
her
manners
had
all
the
elegance
which
her
husband
s
wanted
but
they
would
have
been
improved
by
some
share
of
his
frankness
and
warmth
and
her
visit
was
long
enough
to
detract
something
from
their
first
admiration
by
showing
that
though
perfectly
well
bred
she
was
reserved
cold
and
had
nothing
to
say
for
herself
beyond
the
most
common
place
inquiry
or
remark
conversation
however
was
not
wanted
for
sir
john
was
very
chatty
and
lady
middleton
had
taken
the
wise
precaution
of
bringing
with
her
their
eldest
child
a
fine
little
boy
about
six
years
old
by
which
means
there
was
one
subject
always
to
be
recurred
to
by
the
ladies
in
case
of
extremity
for
they
had
to
enquire
his
name
and
age
admire
his
beauty
and
ask
him
questions
which
his
mother
answered
for
him
while
he
hung
about
her
and
held
down
his
head
to
the
great
surprise
of
her
ladyship
who
wondered
at
his
being
so
shy
before
company
as
he
could
make
noise
enough
at
home
on
every
formal
visit
a
child
ought
to
be
of
the
party
by
way
of
provision
for
discourse
in
the
present
case
it
took
up
ten
minutes
to
determine
whether
the
boy
were
most
like
his
father
or
mother
and
in
what
particular
he
resembled
either
for
of
course
every
body
differed
and
every
body
was
astonished
at
the
opinion
of
the
others
an
opportunity
was
soon
to
be
given
to
the
dashwoods
of
debating
on
the
rest
of
the
children
as
sir
john
would
not
leave
the
house
without
securing
their
promise
of
dining
at
the
park
the
next
day
chapter
vii
barton
park
was
about
half
a
mile
from
the
cottage
the
ladies
had
passed
near
it
in
their
way
along
the
valley
but
it
was
screened
from
their
view
at
home
by
the
projection
of
a
hill
the
house
was
large
and
handsome
and
the
middletons
lived
in
a
style
of
equal
hospitality
and
elegance
the
former
was
for
sir
john
s
gratification
the
latter
for
that
of
his
lady
they
were
scarcely
ever
without
some
friends
staying
with
them
in
the
house
and
they
kept
more
company
of
every
kind
than
any
other
family
in
the
neighbourhood
it
was
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
both
for
however
dissimilar
in
temper
and
outward
behaviour
they
strongly
resembled
each
other
in
that
total
want
of
talent
and
taste
which
confined
their
employments
unconnected
with
such
as
society
produced
within
a
very
narrow
compass
sir
john
was
a
sportsman
lady
middleton
a
mother
he
hunted
and
shot
and
she
humoured
her
children
and
these
were
their
only
resources
lady
middleton
had
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
spoil
her
children
all
the
year
round
while
sir
john
s
independent
employments
were
in
existence
only
half
the
time
continual
engagements
at
home
and
abroad
however
supplied
all
the
deficiencies
of
nature
and
education
supported
the
good
spirits
of
sir
john
and
gave
exercise
to
the
good
breeding
of
his
wife
lady
middleton
piqued
herself
upon
the
elegance
of
her
table
and
of
all
her
domestic
arrangements
and
from
this
kind
of
vanity
was
her
greatest
enjoyment
in
any
of
their
parties
but
sir
john
s
satisfaction
in
society
was
much
more
real
he
delighted
in
collecting
about
him
more
young
people
than
his
house
would
hold
and
the
noisier
they
were
the
better
was
he
pleased
he
was
a
blessing
to
all
the
juvenile
part
of
the
neighbourhood
for
in
summer
he
was
for
ever
forming
parties
to
eat
cold
ham
and
chicken
out
of
doors
and
in
winter
his
private
balls
were
numerous
enough
for
any
young
lady
who
was
not
suffering
under
the
insatiable
appetite
of
fifteen
the
arrival
of
a
new
family
in
the
country
was
always
a
matter
of
joy
to
him
and
in
every
point
of
view
he
was
charmed
with
the
inhabitants
he
had
now
procured
for
his
cottage
at
barton
the
miss
dashwoods
were
young
pretty
and
unaffected
it
was
enough
to
secure
his
good
opinion
for
to
be
unaffected
was
all
that
a
pretty
girl
could
want
to
make
her
mind
as
captivating
as
her
person
the
friendliness
of
his
disposition
made
him
happy
in
accommodating
those
whose
situation
might
be
considered
in
comparison
with
the
past
as
unfortunate
in
showing
kindness
to
his
cousins
therefore
he
had
the
real
satisfaction
of
a
good
heart
and
in
settling
a
family
of
females
only
in
his
cottage
he
had
all
the
satisfaction
of
a
sportsman
for
a
sportsman
though
he
esteems
only
those
of
his
sex
who
are
sportsmen
likewise
is
not
often
desirous
of
encouraging
their
taste
by
admitting
them
to
a
residence
within
his
own
manor
mrs
dashwood
and
her
daughters
were
met
at
the
door
of
the
house
by
sir
john
who
welcomed
them
to
barton
park
with
unaffected
sincerity
and
as
he
attended
them
to
the
drawing
room
repeated
to
the
young
ladies
the
concern
which
the
same
subject
had
drawn
from
him
the
day
before
at
being
unable
to
get
any
smart
young
men
to
meet
them
they
would
see
he
said
only
one
gentleman
there
besides
himself
a
particular
friend
who
was
staying
at
the
park
but
who
was
neither
very
young
nor
very
gay
he
hoped
they
would
all
excuse
the
smallness
of
the
party
and
could
assure
them
it
should
never
happen
so
again
he
had
been
to
several
families
that
morning
in
hopes
of
procuring
some
addition
to
their
number
but
it
was
moonlight
and
every
body
was
full
of
engagements
luckily
lady
middleton
s
mother
had
arrived
at
barton
within
the
last
hour
and
as
she
was
a
very
cheerful
agreeable
woman
he
hoped
the
young
ladies
would
not
find
it
so
very
dull
as
they
might
imagine
the
young
ladies
as
well
as
their
mother
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
having
two
entire
strangers
of
the
party
and
wished
for
no
more
mrs
jennings
lady
middleton
s
mother
was
a
good
humoured
merry
fat
elderly
woman
who
talked
a
great
deal
seemed
very
happy
and
rather
vulgar
she
was
full
of
jokes
and
laughter
and
before
dinner
was
over
had
said
many
witty
things
on
the
subject
of
lovers
and
husbands
hoped
they
had
not
left
their
hearts
behind
them
in
sussex
and
pretended
to
see
them
blush
whether
they
did
or
not
marianne
was
vexed
at
it
for
her
sister
s
sake
and
turned
her
eyes
towards
elinor
to
see
how
she
bore
these
attacks
with
an
earnestness
which
gave
elinor
far
more
pain
than
could
arise
from
such
common
place
raillery
as
mrs
jennings
s
colonel
brandon
the
friend
of
sir
john
seemed
no
more
adapted
by
resemblance
of
manner
to
be
his
friend
than
lady
middleton
was
to
be
his
wife
or
mrs
jennings
to
be
lady
middleton
s
mother
he
was
silent
and
grave
his
appearance
however
was
not
unpleasing
in
spite
of
his
being
in
the
opinion
of
marianne
and
margaret
an
absolute
old
bachelor
for
he
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
five
and
thirty
but
though
his
face
was
not
handsome
his
countenance
was
sensible
and
his
address
was
particularly
gentlemanlike
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
the
party
which
could
recommend
them
as
companions
to
the
dashwoods
but
the
cold
insipidity
of
lady
middleton
was
so
particularly
repulsive
that
in
comparison
of
it
the
gravity
of
colonel
brandon
and
even
the
boisterous
mirth
of
sir
john
and
his
mother
in
law
was
interesting
lady
middleton
seemed
to
be
roused
to
enjoyment
only
by
the
entrance
of
her
four
noisy
children
after
dinner
who
pulled
her
about
tore
her
clothes
and
put
an
end
to
every
kind
of
discourse
except
what
related
to
themselves
in
the
evening
as
marianne
was
discovered
to
be
musical
she
was
invited
to
play
the
instrument
was
unlocked
every
body
prepared
to
be
charmed
and
marianne
who
sang
very
well
at
their
request
went
through
the
chief
of
the
songs
which
lady
middleton
had
brought
into
the
family
on
her
marriage
and
which
perhaps
had
lain
ever
since
in
the
same
position
on
the
pianoforte
for
her
ladyship
had
celebrated
that
event
by
giving
up
music
although
by
her
mother
s
account
she
had
played
extremely
well
and
by
her
own
was
very
fond
of
it
marianne
s
performance
was
highly
applauded
sir
john
was
loud
in
his
admiration
at
the
end
of
every
song
and
as
loud
in
his
conversation
with
the
others
while
every
song
lasted
lady
middleton
frequently
called
him
to
order
wondered
how
any
one
s
attention
could
be
diverted
from
music
for
a
moment
and
asked
marianne
to
sing
a
particular
song
which
marianne
had
just
finished
colonel
brandon
alone
of
all
the
party
heard
her
without
being
in
raptures
he
paid
her
only
the
compliment
of
attention
and
she
felt
a
respect
for
him
on
the
occasion
which
the
others
had
reasonably
forfeited
by
their
shameless
want
of
taste
his
pleasure
in
music
though
it
amounted
not
to
that
ecstatic
delight
which
alone
could
sympathize
with
her
own
was
estimable
when
contrasted
against
the
horrible
insensibility
of
the
others
and
she
was
reasonable
enough
to
allow
that
a
man
of
five
and
thirty
might
well
have
outlived
all
acuteness
of
feeling
and
every
exquisite
power
of
enjoyment
she
was
perfectly
disposed
to
make
every
allowance
for
the
colonel
s
advanced
state
of
life
which
humanity
required
chapter
viii
mrs
jennings
was
a
widow
with
an
ample
jointure
she
had
only
two
daughters
both
of
whom
she
had
lived
to
see
respectably
married
and
she
had
now
therefore
nothing
to
do
but
to
marry
all
the
rest
of
the
world
in
the
promotion
of
this
object
she
was
zealously
active
as
far
as
her
ability
reached
and
missed
no
opportunity
of
projecting
weddings
among
all
the
young
people
of
her
acquaintance
she
was
remarkably
quick
in
the
discovery
of
attachments
and
had
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
raising
the
blushes
and
the
vanity
of
many
a
young
lady
by
insinuations
of
her
power
over
such
a
young
man
and
this
kind
of
discernment
enabled
her
soon
after
her
arrival
at
barton
decisively
to
pronounce
that
colonel
brandon
was
very
much
in
love
with
marianne
dashwood
she
rather
suspected
it
to
be
so
on
the
very
first
evening
of
their
being
together
from
his
listening
so
attentively
while
she
sang
to
them
and
when
the
visit
was
returned
by
the
middletons
dining
at
the
cottage
the
fact
was
ascertained
by
his
listening
to
her
again
it
must
be
so
she
was
perfectly
convinced
of
it
it
would
be
an
excellent
match
for
he
was
rich
and
she
was
handsome
mrs
jennings
had
been
anxious
to
see
colonel
brandon
well
married
ever
since
her
connection
with
sir
john
first
brought
him
to
her
knowledge
and
she
was
always
anxious
to
get
a
good
husband
for
every
pretty
girl
the
immediate
advantage
to
herself
was
by
no
means
inconsiderable
for
it
supplied
her
with
endless
jokes
against
them
both
at
the
park
she
laughed
at
the
colonel
and
in
the
cottage
at
marianne
to
the
former
her
raillery
was
probably
as
far
as
it
regarded
only
himself
perfectly
indifferent
but
to
the
latter
it
was
at
first
incomprehensible
and
when
its
object
was
understood
she
hardly
knew
whether
most
to
laugh
at
its
absurdity
or
censure
its
impertinence
for
she
considered
it
as
an
unfeeling
reflection
on
the
colonel
s
advanced
years
and
on
his
forlorn
condition
as
an
old
bachelor
mrs
dashwood
who
could
not
think
a
man
five
years
younger
than
herself
so
exceedingly
ancient
as
he
appeared
to
the
youthful
fancy
of
her
daughter
ventured
to
clear
mrs
jennings
from
the
probability
of
wishing
to
throw
ridicule
on
his
age
but
at
least
mamma
you
cannot
deny
the
absurdity
of
the
accusation
though
you
may
not
think
it
intentionally
ill
natured
colonel
brandon
is
certainly
younger
than
mrs
jennings
but
he
is
old
enough
to
be
my
father
and
if
he
were
ever
animated
enough
to
be
in
love
must
have
long
outlived
every
sensation
of
the
kind
it
is
too
ridiculous
when
is
a
man
to
be
safe
from
such
wit
if
age
and
infirmity
will
not
protect
him
infirmity
said
elinor
do
you
call
colonel
brandon
infirm
i
can
easily
suppose
that
his
age
may
appear
much
greater
to
you
than
to
my
mother
but
you
can
hardly
deceive
yourself
as
to
his
having
the
use
of
his
limbs
did
not
you
hear
him
complain
of
the
rheumatism
and
is
not
that
the
commonest
infirmity
of
declining
life
my
dearest
child
said
her
mother
laughing
at
this
rate
you
must
be
in
continual
terror
of
my
decay
and
it
must
seem
to
you
a
miracle
that
my
life
has
been
extended
to
the
advanced
age
of
forty
mamma
you
are
not
doing
me
justice
i
know
very
well
that
colonel
brandon
is
not
old
enough
to
make
his
friends
yet
apprehensive
of
losing
him
in
the
course
of
nature
he
may
live
twenty
years
longer
but
thirty
five
has
nothing
to
do
with
matrimony
perhaps
said
elinor
thirty
five
and
seventeen
had
better
not
have
any
thing
to
do
with
matrimony
together
but
if
there
should
by
any
chance
happen
to
be
a
woman
who
is
single
at
seven
and
twenty
i
should
not
think
colonel
brandon
s
being
thirty
five
any
objection
to
his
marrying
her
a
woman
of
seven
and
twenty
said
marianne
after
pausing
a
moment
can
never
hope
to
feel
or
inspire
affection
again
and
if
her
home
be
uncomfortable
or
her
fortune
small
i
can
suppose
that
she
might
bring
herself
to
submit
to
the
offices
of
a
nurse
for
the
sake
of
the
provision
and
security
of
a
wife
in
his
marrying
such
a
woman
therefore
there
would
be
nothing
unsuitable
it
would
be
a
compact
of
convenience
and
the
world
would
be
satisfied
in
my
eyes
it
would
be
no
marriage
at
all
but
that
would
be
nothing
to
me
it
would
seem
only
a
commercial
exchange
in
which
each
wished
to
be
benefited
at
the
expense
of
the
other
it
would
be
impossible
i
know
replied
elinor
to
convince
you
that
a
woman
of
seven
and
twenty
could
feel
for
a
man
of
thirty
five
anything
near
enough
to
love
to
make
him
a
desirable
companion
to
her
but
i
must
object
to
your
dooming
colonel
brandon
and
his
wife
to
the
constant
confinement
of
a
sick
chamber
merely
because
he
chanced
to
complain
yesterday
a
very
cold
damp
day
of
a
slight
rheumatic
feel
in
one
of
his
shoulders
but
he
talked
of
flannel
waistcoats
said
marianne
and
with
me
a
flannel
waistcoat
is
invariably
connected
with
aches
cramps
rheumatisms
and
every
species
of
ailment
that
can
afflict
the
old
and
the
feeble
had
he
been
only
in
a
violent
fever
you
would
not
have
despised
him
half
so
much
confess
marianne
is
not
there
something
interesting
to
you
in
the
flushed
cheek
hollow
eye
and
quick
pulse
of
a
fever
soon
after
this
upon
elinor
s
leaving
the
room
mamma
said
marianne
i
have
an
alarm
on
the
subject
of
illness
which
i
cannot
conceal
from
you
i
am
sure
edward
ferrars
is
not
well
we
have
now
been
here
almost
a
fortnight
and
yet
he
does
not
come
nothing
but
real
indisposition
could
occasion
this
extraordinary
delay
what
else
can
detain
him
at
norland
had
you
any
idea
of
his
coming
so
soon
said
mrs
dashwood
i
had
none
on
the
contrary
if
i
have
felt
any
anxiety
at
all
on
the
subject
it
has
been
in
recollecting
that
he
sometimes
showed
a
want
of
pleasure
and
readiness
in
accepting
my
invitation
when
i
talked
of
his
coming
to
barton
does
elinor
expect
him
already
i
have
never
mentioned
it
to
her
but
of
course
she
must
i
rather
think
you
are
mistaken
for
when
i
was
talking
to
her
yesterday
of
getting
a
new
grate
for
the
spare
bed
chamber
she
observed
that
there
was
no
immediate
hurry
for
it
as
it
was
not
likely
that
the
room
would
be
wanted
for
some
time
how
strange
this
is
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
but
the
whole
of
their
behaviour
to
each
other
has
been
unaccountable
how
cold
how
composed
were
their
last
adieus
how
languid
their
conversation
the
last
evening
of
their
being
together
in
edward
s
farewell
there
was
no
distinction
between
elinor
and
me
it
was
the
good
wishes
of
an
affectionate
brother
to
both
twice
did
i
leave
them
purposely
together
in
the
course
of
the
last
morning
and
each
time
did
he
most
unaccountably
follow
me
out
of
the
room
and
elinor
in
quitting
norland
and
edward
cried
not
as
i
did
even
now
her
self
command
is
invariable
when
is
she
dejected
or
melancholy
when
does
she
try
to
avoid
society
or
appear
restless
and
dissatisfied
in
it
chapter
ix
the
dashwoods
were
now
settled
at
barton
with
tolerable
comfort
to
themselves
the
house
and
the
garden
with
all
the
objects
surrounding
them
were
now
become
familiar
and
the
ordinary
pursuits
which
had
given
to
norland
half
its
charms
were
engaged
in
again
with
far
greater
enjoyment
than
norland
had
been
able
to
afford
since
the
loss
of
their
father
sir
john
middleton
who
called
on
them
every
day
for
the
first
fortnight
and
who
was
not
in
the
habit
of
seeing
much
occupation
at
home
could
not
conceal
his
amazement
on
finding
them
always
employed
their
visitors
except
those
from
barton
park
were
not
many
for
in
spite
of
sir
john
s
urgent
entreaties
that
they
would
mix
more
in
the
neighbourhood
and
repeated
assurances
of
his
carriage
being
always
at
their
service
the
independence
of
mrs
dashwood
s
spirit
overcame
the
wish
of
society
for
her
children
and
she
was
resolute
in
declining
to
visit
any
family
beyond
the
distance
of
a
walk
there
were
but
few
who
could
be
so
classed
and
it
was
not
all
of
them
that
were
attainable
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
cottage
along
the
narrow
winding
valley
of
allenham
which
issued
from
that
of
barton
as
formerly
described
the
girls
had
in
one
of
their
earliest
walks
discovered
an
ancient
respectable
looking
mansion
which
by
reminding
them
a
little
of
norland
interested
their
imagination
and
made
them
wish
to
be
better
acquainted
with
it
but
they
learnt
on
enquiry
that
its
possessor
an
elderly
lady
of
very
good
character
was
unfortunately
too
infirm
to
mix
with
the
world
and
never
stirred
from
home
the
whole
country
about
them
abounded
in
beautiful
walks
the
high
downs
which
invited
them
from
almost
every
window
of
the
cottage
to
seek
the
exquisite
enjoyment
of
air
on
their
summits
were
a
happy
alternative
when
the
dirt
of
the
valleys
beneath
shut
up
their
superior
beauties
and
towards
one
of
these
hills
did
marianne
and
margaret
one
memorable
morning
direct
their
steps
attracted
by
the
partial
sunshine
of
a
showery
sky
and
unable
longer
to
bear
the
confinement
which
the
settled
rain
of
the
two
preceding
days
had
occasioned
the
weather
was
not
tempting
enough
to
draw
the
two
others
from
their
pencil
and
their
book
in
spite
of
marianne
s
declaration
that
the
day
would
be
lastingly
fair
and
that
every
threatening
cloud
would
be
drawn
off
from
their
hills
and
the
two
girls
set
off
together
they
gaily
ascended
the
downs
rejoicing
in
their
own
penetration
at
every
glimpse
of
blue
sky
and
when
they
caught
in
their
faces
the
animating
gales
of
a
high
south
westerly
wind
they
pitied
the
fears
which
had
prevented
their
mother
and
elinor
from
sharing
such
delightful
sensations
is
there
a
felicity
in
the
world
said
marianne
superior
to
this
margaret
we
will
walk
here
at
least
two
hours
margaret
agreed
and
they
pursued
their
way
against
the
wind
resisting
it
with
laughing
delight
for
about
twenty
minutes
longer
when
suddenly
the
clouds
united
over
their
heads
and
a
driving
rain
set
full
in
their
face
chagrined
and
surprised
they
were
obliged
though
unwillingly
to
turn
back
for
no
shelter
was
nearer
than
their
own
house
one
consolation
however
remained
for
them
to
which
the
exigence
of
the
moment
gave
more
than
usual
propriety
it
was
that
of
running
with
all
possible
speed
down
the
steep
side
of
the
hill
which
led
immediately
to
their
garden
gate
they
set
off
marianne
had
at
first
the
advantage
but
a
false
step
brought
her
suddenly
to
the
ground
and
margaret
unable
to
stop
herself
to
assist
her
was
involuntarily
hurried
along
and
reached
the
bottom
in
safety
a
gentleman
carrying
a
gun
with
two
pointers
playing
round
him
was
passing
up
the
hill
and
within
a
few
yards
of
marianne
when
her
accident
happened
he
put
down
his
gun
and
ran
to
her
assistance
she
had
raised
herself
from
the
ground
but
her
foot
had
been
twisted
in
her
fall
and
she
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
the
gentleman
offered
his
services
and
perceiving
that
her
modesty
declined
what
her
situation
rendered
necessary
took
her
up
in
his
arms
without
farther
delay
and
carried
her
down
the
hill
then
passing
through
the
garden
the
gate
of
which
had
been
left
open
by
margaret
he
bore
her
directly
into
the
house
whither
margaret
was
just
arrived
and
quitted
not
his
hold
till
he
had
seated
her
in
a
chair
in
the
parlour
elinor
and
her
mother
rose
up
in
amazement
at
their
entrance
and
while
the
eyes
of
both
were
fixed
on
him
with
an
evident
wonder
and
a
secret
admiration
which
equally
sprung
from
his
appearance
he
apologized
for
his
intrusion
by
relating
its
cause
in
a
manner
so
frank
and
so
graceful
that
his
person
which
was
uncommonly
handsome
received
additional
charms
from
his
voice
and
expression
had
he
been
even
old
ugly
and
vulgar
the
gratitude
and
kindness
of
mrs
dashwood
would
have
been
secured
by
any
act
of
attention
to
her
child
but
the
influence
of
youth
beauty
and
elegance
gave
an
interest
to
the
action
which
came
home
to
her
feelings
she
thanked
him
again
and
again
and
with
a
sweetness
of
address
which
always
attended
her
invited
him
to
be
seated
but
this
he
declined
as
he
was
dirty
and
wet
mrs
dashwood
then
begged
to
know
to
whom
she
was
obliged
his
name
he
replied
was
willoughby
and
his
present
home
was
at
allenham
from
whence
he
hoped
she
would
allow
him
the
honour
of
calling
tomorrow
to
enquire
after
miss
dashwood
the
honour
was
readily
granted
and
he
then
departed
to
make
himself
still
more
interesting
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
rain
his
manly
beauty
and
more
than
common
gracefulness
were
instantly
the
theme
of
general
admiration
and
the
laugh
which
his
gallantry
raised
against
marianne
received
particular
spirit
from
his
exterior
attractions
marianne
herself
had
seen
less
of
his
person
than
the
rest
for
the
confusion
which
crimsoned
over
her
face
on
his
lifting
her
up
had
robbed
her
of
the
power
of
regarding
him
after
their
entering
the
house
but
she
had
seen
enough
of
him
to
join
in
all
the
admiration
of
the
others
and
with
an
energy
which
always
adorned
her
praise
his
person
and
air
were
equal
to
what
her
fancy
had
ever
drawn
for
the
hero
of
a
favourite
story
and
in
his
carrying
her
into
the
house
with
so
little
previous
formality
there
was
a
rapidity
of
thought
which
particularly
recommended
the
action
to
her
every
circumstance
belonging
to
him
was
interesting
his
name
was
good
his
residence
was
in
their
favourite
village
and
she
soon
found
out
that
of
all
manly
dresses
a
shooting
jacket
was
the
most
becoming
her
imagination
was
busy
her
reflections
were
pleasant
and
the
pain
of
a
sprained
ankle
was
disregarded
sir
john
called
on
them
as
soon
as
the
next
interval
of
fair
weather
that
morning
allowed
him
to
get
out
of
doors
and
marianne
s
accident
being
related
to
him
he
was
eagerly
asked
whether
he
knew
any
gentleman
of
the
name
of
willoughby
at
allenham
willoughby
cried
sir
john
what
is
he
in
the
country
that
is
good
news
however
i
will
ride
over
tomorrow
and
ask
him
to
dinner
on
thursday
you
know
him
then
said
mrs
dashwood
know
him
to
be
sure
i
do
why
he
is
down
here
every
year
and
what
sort
of
a
young
man
is
he
as
good
a
kind
of
fellow
as
ever
lived
i
assure
you
a
very
decent
shot
and
there
is
not
a
bolder
rider
in
england
and
is
that
all
you
can
say
for
him
cried
marianne
indignantly
but
what
are
his
manners
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
what
his
pursuits
his
talents
and
genius
sir
john
was
rather
puzzled
upon
my
soul
said
he
i
do
not
know
much
about
him
as
to
all
that
but
he
is
a
pleasant
good
humoured
fellow
and
has
got
the
nicest
little
black
bitch
of
a
pointer
i
ever
saw
was
she
out
with
him
today
but
marianne
could
no
more
satisfy
him
as
to
the
colour
of
mr
willoughby
s
pointer
than
he
could
describe
to
her
the
shades
of
his
mind
but
who
is
he
said
elinor
where
does
he
come
from
has
he
a
house
at
allenham
on
this
point
sir
john
could
give
more
certain
intelligence
and
he
told
them
that
mr
willoughby
had
no
property
of
his
own
in
the
country
that
he
resided
there
only
while
he
was
visiting
the
old
lady
at
allenham
court
to
whom
he
was
related
and
whose
possessions
he
was
to
inherit
adding
yes
yes
he
is
very
well
worth
catching
i
can
tell
you
miss
dashwood
he
has
a
pretty
little
estate
of
his
own
in
somersetshire
besides
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
give
him
up
to
my
younger
sister
in
spite
of
all
this
tumbling
down
hills
miss
marianne
must
not
expect
to
have
all
the
men
to
herself
brandon
will
be
jealous
if
she
does
not
take
care
i
do
not
believe
said
mrs
dashwood
with
a
good
humoured
smile
that
mr
willoughby
will
be
incommoded
by
the
attempts
of
either
of
my
daughters
towards
what
you
call
catching
him
it
is
not
an
employment
to
which
they
have
been
brought
up
men
are
very
safe
with
us
let
them
be
ever
so
rich
i
am
glad
to
find
however
from
what
you
say
that
he
is
a
respectable
young
man
and
one
whose
acquaintance
will
not
be
ineligible
he
is
as
good
a
sort
of
fellow
i
believe
as
ever
lived
repeated
sir
john
i
remember
last
christmas
at
a
little
hop
at
the
park
he
danced
from
eight
o
clock
till
four
without
once
sitting
down
did
he
indeed
cried
marianne
with
sparkling
eyes
and
with
elegance
with
spirit
yes
and
he
was
up
again
at
eight
to
ride
to
covert
that
is
what
i
like
that
is
what
a
young
man
ought
to
be
whatever
be
his
pursuits
his
eagerness
in
them
should
know
no
moderation
and
leave
him
no
sense
of
fatigue
aye
aye
i
see
how
it
will
be
said
sir
john
i
see
how
it
will
be
you
will
be
setting
your
cap
at
him
now
and
never
think
of
poor
brandon
that
is
an
expression
sir
john
said
marianne
warmly
which
i
particularly
dislike
i
abhor
every
common
place
phrase
by
which
wit
is
intended
and
setting
one
s
cap
at
a
man
or
making
a
conquest
are
the
most
odious
of
all
their
tendency
is
gross
and
illiberal
and
if
their
construction
could
ever
be
deemed
clever
time
has
long
ago
destroyed
all
its
ingenuity
sir
john
did
not
much
understand
this
reproof
but
he
laughed
as
heartily
as
if
he
did
and
then
replied
ay
you
will
make
conquests
enough
i
dare
say
one
way
or
other
poor
brandon
he
is
quite
smitten
already
and
he
is
very
well
worth
setting
your
cap
at
i
can
tell
you
in
spite
of
all
this
tumbling
about
and
spraining
of
ankles
chapter
x
marianne
s
preserver
as
margaret
with
more
elegance
than
precision
styled
willoughby
called
at
the
cottage
early
the
next
morning
to
make
his
personal
enquiries
he
was
received
by
mrs
dashwood
with
more
than
politeness
with
a
kindness
which
sir
john
s
account
of
him
and
her
own
gratitude
prompted
and
every
thing
that
passed
during
the
visit
tended
to
assure
him
of
the
sense
elegance
mutual
affection
and
domestic
comfort
of
the
family
to
whom
accident
had
now
introduced
him
of
their
personal
charms
he
had
not
required
a
second
interview
to
be
convinced
miss
dashwood
had
a
delicate
complexion
regular
features
and
a
remarkably
pretty
figure
marianne
was
still
handsomer
her
form
though
not
so
correct
as
her
sister
s
in
having
the
advantage
of
height
was
more
striking
and
her
face
was
so
lovely
that
when
in
the
common
cant
of
praise
she
was
called
a
beautiful
girl
truth
was
less
violently
outraged
than
usually
happens
her
skin
was
very
brown
but
from
its
transparency
her
complexion
was
uncommonly
brilliant
her
features
were
all
good
her
smile
was
sweet
and
attractive
and
in
her
eyes
which
were
very
dark
there
was
a
life
a
spirit
an
eagerness
which
could
hardily
be
seen
without
delight
from
willoughby
their
expression
was
at
first
held
back
by
the
embarrassment
which
the
remembrance
of
his
assistance
created
but
when
this
passed
away
when
her
spirits
became
collected
when
she
saw
that
to
the
perfect
good
breeding
of
the
gentleman
he
united
frankness
and
vivacity
and
above
all
when
she
heard
him
declare
that
of
music
and
dancing
he
was
passionately
fond
she
gave
him
such
a
look
of
approbation
as
secured
the
largest
share
of
his
discourse
to
herself
for
the
rest
of
his
stay
it
was
only
necessary
to
mention
any
favourite
amusement
to
engage
her
to
talk
she
could
not
be
silent
when
such
points
were
introduced
and
she
had
neither
shyness
nor
reserve
in
their
discussion
they
speedily
discovered
that
their
enjoyment
of
dancing
and
music
was
mutual
and
that
it
arose
from
a
general
conformity
of
judgment
in
all
that
related
to
either
encouraged
by
this
to
a
further
examination
of
his
opinions
she
proceeded
to
question
him
on
the
subject
of
books
her
favourite
authors
were
brought
forward
and
dwelt
upon
with
so
rapturous
a
delight
that
any
young
man
of
five
and
twenty
must
have
been
insensible
indeed
not
to
become
an
immediate
convert
to
the
excellence
of
such
works
however
disregarded
before
their
taste
was
strikingly
alike
the
same
books
the
same
passages
were
idolized
by
each
or
if
any
difference
appeared
any
objection
arose
it
lasted
no
longer
than
till
the
force
of
her
arguments
and
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
could
be
displayed
he
acquiesced
in
all
her
decisions
caught
all
her
enthusiasm
and
long
before
his
visit
concluded
they
conversed
with
the
familiarity
of
a
long
established
acquaintance
well
marianne
said
elinor
as
soon
as
he
had
left
them
for
one
morning
i
think
you
have
done
pretty
well
you
have
already
ascertained
mr
willoughby
s
opinion
in
almost
every
matter
of
importance
you
know
what
he
thinks
of
cowper
and
scott
you
are
certain
of
his
estimating
their
beauties
as
he
ought
and
you
have
received
every
assurance
of
his
admiring
pope
no
more
than
is
proper
but
how
is
your
acquaintance
to
be
long
supported
under
such
extraordinary
despatch
of
every
subject
for
discourse
you
will
soon
have
exhausted
each
favourite
topic
another
meeting
will
suffice
to
explain
his
sentiments
on
picturesque
beauty
and
second
marriages
and
then
you
can
have
nothing
farther
to
ask
elinor
cried
marianne
is
this
fair
is
this
just
are
my
ideas
so
scanty
but
i
see
what
you
mean
i
have
been
too
much
at
my
ease
too
happy
too
frank
i
have
erred
against
every
common
place
notion
of
decorum
i
have
been
open
and
sincere
where
i
ought
to
have
been
reserved
spiritless
dull
and
deceitful
had
i
talked
only
of
the
weather
and
the
roads
and
had
i
spoken
only
once
in
ten
minutes
this
reproach
would
have
been
spared
my
love
said
her
mother
you
must
not
be
offended
with
elinor
she
was
only
in
jest
i
should
scold
her
myself
if
she
were
capable
of
wishing
to
check
the
delight
of
your
conversation
with
our
new
friend
marianne
was
softened
in
a
moment
willoughby
on
his
side
gave
every
proof
of
his
pleasure
in
their
acquaintance
which
an
evident
wish
of
improving
it
could
offer
he
came
to
them
every
day
to
enquire
after
marianne
was
at
first
his
excuse
but
the
encouragement
of
his
reception
to
which
every
day
gave
greater
kindness
made
such
an
excuse
unnecessary
before
it
had
ceased
to
be
possible
by
marianne
s
perfect
recovery
she
was
confined
for
some
days
to
the
house
but
never
had
any
confinement
been
less
irksome
willoughby
was
a
young
man
of
good
abilities
quick
imagination
lively
spirits
and
open
affectionate
manners
he
was
exactly
formed
to
engage
marianne
s
heart
for
with
all
this
he
joined
not
only
a
captivating
person
but
a
natural
ardour
of
mind
which
was
now
roused
and
increased
by
the
example
of
her
own
and
which
recommended
him
to
her
affection
beyond
every
thing
else
his
society
became
gradually
her
most
exquisite
enjoyment
they
read
they
talked
they
sang
together
his
musical
talents
were
considerable
and
he
read
with
all
the
sensibility
and
spirit
which
edward
had
unfortunately
wanted
in
mrs
dashwood
s
estimation
he
was
as
faultless
as
in
marianne
s
and
elinor
saw
nothing
to
censure
in
him
but
a
propensity
in
which
he
strongly
resembled
and
peculiarly
delighted
her
sister
of
saying
too
much
what
he
thought
on
every
occasion
without
attention
to
persons
or
circumstances
in
hastily
forming
and
giving
his
opinion
of
other
people
in
sacrificing
general
politeness
to
the
enjoyment
of
undivided
attention
where
his
heart
was
engaged
and
in
slighting
too
easily
the
forms
of
worldly
propriety
he
displayed
a
want
of
caution
which
elinor
could
not
approve
in
spite
of
all
that
he
and
marianne
could
say
in
its
support
marianne
began
now
to
perceive
that
the
desperation
which
had
seized
her
at
sixteen
and
a
half
of
ever
seeing
a
man
who
could
satisfy
her
ideas
of
perfection
had
been
rash
and
unjustifiable
willoughby
was
all
that
her
fancy
had
delineated
in
that
unhappy
hour
and
in
every
brighter
period
as
capable
of
attaching
her
and
his
behaviour
declared
his
wishes
to
be
in
that
respect
as
earnest
as
his
abilities
were
strong
[illustration
they
sang
together
]
her
mother
too
in
whose
mind
not
one
speculative
thought
of
their
marriage
had
been
raised
by
his
prospect
of
riches
was
led
before
the
end
of
a
week
to
hope
and
expect
it
and
secretly
to
congratulate
herself
on
having
gained
two
such
sons
in
law
as
edward
and
willoughby
colonel
brandon
s
partiality
for
marianne
which
had
so
early
been
discovered
by
his
friends
now
first
became
perceptible
to
elinor
when
it
ceased
to
be
noticed
by
them
their
attention
and
wit
were
drawn
off
to
his
more
fortunate
rival
and
the
raillery
which
the
other
had
incurred
before
any
partiality
arose
was
removed
when
his
feelings
began
really
to
call
for
the
ridicule
so
justly
annexed
to
sensibility
elinor
was
obliged
though
unwillingly
to
believe
that
the
sentiments
which
mrs
jennings
had
assigned
him
for
her
own
satisfaction
were
now
actually
excited
by
her
sister
and
that
however
a
general
resemblance
of
disposition
between
the
parties
might
forward
the
affection
of
mr
willoughby
an
equally
striking
opposition
of
character
was
no
hindrance
to
the
regard
of
colonel
brandon
she
saw
it
with
concern
for
what
could
a
silent
man
of
five
and
thirty
hope
when
opposed
to
a
very
lively
one
of
five
and
twenty
and
as
she
could
not
even
wish
him
successful
she
heartily
wished
him
indifferent
she
liked
him
in
spite
of
his
gravity
and
reserve
she
beheld
in
him
an
object
of
interest
his
manners
though
serious
were
mild
and
his
reserve
appeared
rather
the
result
of
some
oppression
of
spirits
than
of
any
natural
gloominess
of
temper
sir
john
had
dropped
hints
of
past
injuries
and
disappointments
which
justified
her
belief
of
his
being
an
unfortunate
man
and
she
regarded
him
with
respect
and
compassion
perhaps
she
pitied
and
esteemed
him
the
more
because
he
was
slighted
by
willoughby
and
marianne
who
prejudiced
against
him
for
being
neither
lively
nor
young
seemed
resolved
to
undervalue
his
merits
brandon
is
just
the
kind
of
man
said
willoughby
one
day
when
they
were
talking
of
him
together
whom
every
body
speaks
well
of
and
nobody
cares
about
whom
all
are
delighted
to
see
and
nobody
remembers
to
talk
to
that
is
exactly
what
i
think
of
him
cried
marianne
do
not
boast
of
it
however
said
elinor
for
it
is
injustice
in
both
of
you
he
is
highly
esteemed
by
all
the
family
at
the
park
and
i
never
see
him
myself
without
taking
pains
to
converse
with
him
that
he
is
patronised
by
you
replied
willoughby
is
certainly
in
his
favour
but
as
for
the
esteem
of
the
others
it
is
a
reproach
in
itself
who
would
submit
to
the
indignity
of
being
approved
by
such
a
woman
as
lady
middleton
and
mrs
jennings
that
could
command
the
indifference
of
any
body
else
but
perhaps
the
abuse
of
such
people
as
yourself
and
marianne
will
make
amends
for
the
regard
of
lady
middleton
and
her
mother
if
their
praise
is
censure
your
censure
may
be
praise
for
they
are
not
more
undiscerning
than
you
are
prejudiced
and
unjust
in
defence
of
your
prot
g
you
can
even
be
saucy
my
prot
g
as
you
call
him
is
a
sensible
man
and
sense
will
always
have
attractions
for
me
yes
marianne
even
in
a
man
between
thirty
and
forty
he
has
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
has
been
abroad
has
read
and
has
a
thinking
mind
i
have
found
him
capable
of
giving
me
much
information
on
various
subjects
and
he
has
always
answered
my
inquiries
with
readiness
of
good
breeding
and
good
nature
that
is
to
say
cried
marianne
contemptuously
he
has
told
you
that
in
the
east
indies
the
climate
is
hot
and
the
mosquitoes
are
troublesome
he
would
have
told
me
so
i
doubt
not
had
i
made
any
such
inquiries
but
they
happened
to
be
points
on
which
i
had
been
previously
informed
perhaps
said
willoughby
his
observations
may
have
extended
to
the
existence
of
nabobs
gold
mohrs
and
palanquins
i
may
venture
to
say
that
his
observations
have
stretched
much
further
than
your
candour
but
why
should
you
dislike
him
i
do
not
dislike
him
i
consider
him
on
the
contrary
as
a
very
respectable
man
who
has
every
body
s
good
word
and
nobody
s
notice
who
has
more
money
than
he
can
spend
more
time
than
he
knows
how
to
employ
and
two
new
coats
every
year
add
to
which
cried
marianne
that
he
has
neither
genius
taste
nor
spirit
that
his
understanding
has
no
brilliancy
his
feelings
no
ardour
and
his
voice
no
expression
you
decide
on
his
imperfections
so
much
in
the
mass
replied
elinor
and
so
much
on
the
strength
of
your
own
imagination
that
the
commendation
i
am
able
to
give
of
him
is
comparatively
cold
and
insipid
i
can
only
pronounce
him
to
be
a
sensible
man
well
bred
well
informed
of
gentle
address
and
i
believe
possessing
an
amiable
heart
miss
dashwood
cried
willoughby
you
are
now
using
me
unkindly
you
are
endeavouring
to
disarm
me
by
reason
and
to
convince
me
against
my
will
but
it
will
not
do
you
shall
find
me
as
stubborn
as
you
can
be
artful
i
have
three
unanswerable
reasons
for
disliking
colonel
brandon
he
threatened
me
with
rain
when
i
wanted
it
to
be
fine
he
has
found
fault
with
the
hanging
of
my
curricle
and
i
cannot
persuade
him
to
buy
my
brown
mare
if
it
will
be
any
satisfaction
to
you
however
to
be
told
that
i
believe
his
character
to
be
in
other
respects
irreproachable
i
am
ready
to
confess
it
and
in
return
for
an
acknowledgment
which
must
give
me
some
pain
you
cannot
deny
me
the
privilege
of
disliking
him
as
much
as
ever
chapter
xi
little
had
mrs
dashwood
or
her
daughters
imagined
when
they
first
came
into
devonshire
that
so
many
engagements
would
arise
to
occupy
their
time
as
shortly
presented
themselves
or
that
they
should
have
such
frequent
invitations
and
such
constant
visitors
as
to
leave
them
little
leisure
for
serious
employment
yet
such
was
the
case
when
marianne
was
recovered
the
schemes
of
amusement
at
home
and
abroad
which
sir
john
had
been
previously
forming
were
put
into
execution
the
private
balls
at
the
park
then
began
and
parties
on
the
water
were
made
and
accomplished
as
often
as
a
showery
october
would
allow
in
every
meeting
of
the
kind
willoughby
was
included
and
the
ease
and
familiarity
which
naturally
attended
these
parties
were
exactly
calculated
to
give
increasing
intimacy
to
his
acquaintance
with
the
dashwoods
to
afford
him
opportunity
of
witnessing
the
excellencies
of
marianne
of
marking
his
animated
admiration
of
her
and
of
receiving
in
her
behaviour
to
himself
the
most
pointed
assurance
of
her
affection
elinor
could
not
be
surprised
at
their
attachment
she
only
wished
that
it
were
less
openly
shown
and
once
or
twice
did
venture
to
suggest
the
propriety
of
some
self
command
to
marianne
but
marianne
abhorred
all
concealment
where
no
real
disgrace
could
attend
unreserve
and
to
aim
at
the
restraint
of
sentiments
which
were
not
in
themselves
illaudable
appeared
to
her
not
merely
an
unnecessary
effort
but
a
disgraceful
subjection
of
reason
to
common
place
and
mistaken
notions
willoughby
thought
the
same
and
their
behaviour
at
all
times
was
an
illustration
of
their
opinions
when
he
was
present
she
had
no
eyes
for
any
one
else
every
thing
he
did
was
right
every
thing
he
said
was
clever
if
their
evenings
at
the
park
were
concluded
with
cards
he
cheated
himself
and
all
the
rest
of
the
party
to
get
her
a
good
hand
if
dancing
formed
the
amusement
of
the
night
they
were
partners
for
half
the
time
and
when
obliged
to
separate
for
a
couple
of
dances
were
careful
to
stand
together
and
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
any
body
else
such
conduct
made
them
of
course
most
exceedingly
laughed
at
but
ridicule
could
not
shame
and
seemed
hardly
to
provoke
them
mrs
dashwood
entered
into
all
their
feelings
with
a
warmth
which
left
her
no
inclination
for
checking
this
excessive
display
of
them
to
her
it
was
but
the
natural
consequence
of
a
strong
affection
in
a
young
and
ardent
mind
this
was
the
season
of
happiness
to
marianne
her
heart
was
devoted
to
willoughby
and
the
fond
attachment
to
norland
which
she
brought
with
her
from
sussex
was
more
likely
to
be
softened
than
she
had
thought
it
possible
before
by
the
charms
which
his
society
bestowed
on
her
present
home
elinor
s
happiness
was
not
so
great
her
heart
was
not
so
much
at
ease
nor
her
satisfaction
in
their
amusements
so
pure
they
afforded
her
no
companion
that
could
make
amends
for
what
she
had
left
behind
nor
that
could
teach
her
to
think
of
norland
with
less
regret
than
ever
neither
lady
middleton
nor
mrs
jennings
could
supply
to
her
the
conversation
she
missed
although
the
latter
was
an
everlasting
talker
and
from
the
first
had
regarded
her
with
a
kindness
which
ensured
her
a
large
share
of
her
discourse
she
had
already
repeated
her
own
history
to
elinor
three
or
four
times
and
had
elinor
s
memory
been
equal
to
her
means
of
improvement
she
might
have
known
very
early
in
their
acquaintance
all
the
particulars
of
mr
jennings
s
last
illness
and
what
he
said
to
his
wife
a
few
minutes
before
he
died
lady
middleton
was
more
agreeable
than
her
mother
only
in
being
more
silent
elinor
needed
little
observation
to
perceive
that
her
reserve
was
a
mere
calmness
of
manner
with
which
sense
had
nothing
to
do
towards
her
husband
and
mother
she
was
the
same
as
to
them
and
intimacy
was
therefore
neither
to
be
looked
for
nor
desired
she
had
nothing
to
say
one
day
that
she
had
not
said
the
day
before
her
insipidity
was
invariable
for
even
her
spirits
were
always
the
same
and
though
she
did
not
oppose
the
parties
arranged
by
her
husband
provided
every
thing
were
conducted
in
style
and
her
two
eldest
children
attended
her
she
never
appeared
to
receive
more
enjoyment
from
them
than
she
might
have
experienced
in
sitting
at
home
and
so
little
did
her
presence
add
to
the
pleasure
of
the
others
by
any
share
in
their
conversation
that
they
were
sometimes
only
reminded
of
her
being
amongst
them
by
her
solicitude
about
her
troublesome
boys
in
colonel
brandon
alone
of
all
her
new
acquaintance
did
elinor
find
a
person
who
could
in
any
degree
claim
the
respect
of
abilities
excite
the
interest
of
friendship
or
give
pleasure
as
a
companion
willoughby
was
out
of
the
question
her
admiration
and
regard
even
her
sisterly
regard
was
all
his
own
but
he
was
a
lover
his
attentions
were
wholly
marianne
s
and
a
far
less
agreeable
man
might
have
been
more
generally
pleasing
colonel
brandon
unfortunately
for
himself
had
no
such
encouragement
to
think
only
of
marianne
and
in
conversing
with
elinor
he
found
the
greatest
consolation
for
the
indifference
of
her
sister
elinor
s
compassion
for
him
increased
as
she
had
reason
to
suspect
that
the
misery
of
disappointed
love
had
already
been
known
to
him
this
suspicion
was
given
by
some
words
which
accidentally
dropped
from
him
one
evening
at
the
park
when
they
were
sitting
down
together
by
mutual
consent
while
the
others
were
dancing
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
marianne
and
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
he
said
with
a
faint
smile
your
sister
i
understand
does
not
approve
of
second
attachments
no
replied
elinor
her
opinions
are
all
romantic
or
rather
as
i
believe
she
considers
them
impossible
to
exist
i
believe
she
does
but
how
she
contrives
it
without
reflecting
on
the
character
of
her
own
father
who
had
himself
two
wives
i
know
not
a
few
years
however
will
settle
her
opinions
on
the
reasonable
basis
of
common
sense
and
observation
and
then
they
may
be
more
easy
to
define
and
to
justify
than
they
now
are
by
any
body
but
herself
this
will
probably
be
the
case
he
replied
and
yet
there
is
something
so
amiable
in
the
prejudices
of
a
young
mind
that
one
is
sorry
to
see
them
give
way
to
the
reception
of
more
general
opinions
i
cannot
agree
with
you
there
said
elinor
there
are
inconveniences
attending
such
feelings
as
marianne
s
which
all
the
charms
of
enthusiasm
and
ignorance
of
the
world
cannot
atone
for
her
systems
have
all
the
unfortunate
tendency
of
setting
propriety
at
nought
and
a
better
acquaintance
with
the
world
is
what
i
look
forward
to
as
her
greatest
possible
advantage
after
a
short
pause
he
resumed
the
conversation
by
saying
does
your
sister
make
no
distinction
in
her
objections
against
a
second
attachment
or
is
it
equally
criminal
in
every
body
are
those
who
have
been
disappointed
in
their
first
choice
whether
from
the
inconstancy
of
its
object
or
the
perverseness
of
circumstances
to
be
equally
indifferent
during
the
rest
of
their
lives
upon
my
word
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
minuti
of
her
principles
i
only
know
that
i
never
yet
heard
her
admit
any
instance
of
a
second
attachment
s
being
pardonable
this
said
he
cannot
hold
but
a
change
a
total
change
of
sentiments
no
no
do
not
desire
it
for
when
the
romantic
refinements
of
a
young
mind
are
obliged
to
give
way
how
frequently
are
they
succeeded
by
such
opinions
as
are
but
too
common
and
too
dangerous
i
speak
from
experience
i
once
knew
a
lady
who
in
temper
and
mind
greatly
resembled
your
sister
who
thought
and
judged
like
her
but
who
from
an
enforced
change
from
a
series
of
unfortunate
circumstances
here
he
stopped
suddenly
appeared
to
think
that
he
had
said
too
much
and
by
his
countenance
gave
rise
to
conjectures
which
might
not
otherwise
have
entered
elinor
s
head
the
lady
would
probably
have
passed
without
suspicion
had
he
not
convinced
miss
dashwood
that
what
concerned
her
ought
not
to
escape
his
lips
as
it
was
it
required
but
a
slight
effort
of
fancy
to
connect
his
emotion
with
the
tender
recollection
of
past
regard
elinor
attempted
no
more
but
marianne
in
her
place
would
not
have
done
so
little
the
whole
story
would
have
been
speedily
formed
under
her
active
imagination
and
every
thing
established
in
the
most
melancholy
order
of
disastrous
love
chapter
xii
as
elinor
and
marianne
were
walking
together
the
next
morning
the
latter
communicated
a
piece
of
news
to
her
sister
which
in
spite
of
all
that
she
knew
before
of
marianne
s
imprudence
and
want
of
thought
surprised
her
by
its
extravagant
testimony
of
both
marianne
told
her
with
the
greatest
delight
that
willoughby
had
given
her
a
horse
one
that
he
had
bred
himself
on
his
estate
in
somersetshire
and
which
was
exactly
calculated
to
carry
a
woman
without
considering
that
it
was
not
in
her
mother
s
plan
to
keep
any
horse
that
if
she
were
to
alter
her
resolution
in
favour
of
this
gift
she
must
buy
another
for
the
servant
and
keep
a
servant
to
ride
it
and
after
all
build
a
stable
to
receive
them
she
had
accepted
the
present
without
hesitation
and
told
her
sister
of
it
in
raptures
he
intends
to
send
his
groom
into
somersetshire
immediately
for
it
she
added
and
when
it
arrives
we
will
ride
every
day
you
shall
share
its
use
with
me
imagine
to
yourself
my
dear
elinor
the
delight
of
a
gallop
on
some
of
these
downs
most
unwilling
was
she
to
awaken
from
such
a
dream
of
felicity
to
comprehend
all
the
unhappy
truths
which
attended
the
affair
and
for
some
time
she
refused
to
submit
to
them
as
to
an
additional
servant
the
expense
would
be
a
trifle
mamma
she
was
sure
would
never
object
to
it
and
any
horse
would
do
for
him
he
might
always
get
one
at
the
park
as
to
a
stable
the
merest
shed
would
be
sufficient
elinor
then
ventured
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
her
receiving
such
a
present
from
a
man
so
little
or
at
least
so
lately
known
to
her
this
was
too
much
you
are
mistaken
elinor
said
she
warmly
in
supposing
i
know
very
little
of
willoughby
i
have
not
known
him
long
indeed
but
i
am
much
better
acquainted
with
him
than
i
am
with
any
other
creature
in
the
world
except
yourself
and
mama
it
is
not
time
or
opportunity
that
is
to
determine
intimacy
it
is
disposition
alone
seven
years
would
be
insufficient
to
make
some
people
acquainted
with
each
other
and
seven
days
are
more
than
enough
for
others
i
should
hold
myself
guilty
of
greater
impropriety
in
accepting
a
horse
from
my
brother
than
from
willoughby
of
john
i
know
very
little
though
we
have
lived
together
for
years
but
of
willoughby
my
judgment
has
long
been
formed
elinor
thought
it
wisest
to
touch
that
point
no
more
she
knew
her
sister
s
temper
opposition
on
so
tender
a
subject
would
only
attach
her
the
more
to
her
own
opinion
but
by
an
appeal
to
her
affection
for
her
mother
by
representing
the
inconveniences
which
that
indulgent
mother
must
draw
on
herself
if
as
would
probably
be
the
case
she
consented
to
this
increase
of
establishment
marianne
was
shortly
subdued
and
she
promised
not
to
tempt
her
mother
to
such
imprudent
kindness
by
mentioning
the
offer
and
to
tell
willoughby
when
she
saw
him
next
that
it
must
be
declined
she
was
faithful
to
her
word
and
when
willoughby
called
at
the
cottage
the
same
day
elinor
heard
her
express
her
disappointment
to
him
in
a
low
voice
on
being
obliged
to
forego
the
acceptance
of
his
present
the
reasons
for
this
alteration
were
at
the
same
time
related
and
they
were
such
as
to
make
further
entreaty
on
his
side
impossible
his
concern
however
was
very
apparent
and
after
expressing
it
with
earnestness
he
added
in
the
same
low
voice
but
marianne
the
horse
is
still
yours
though
you
cannot
use
it
now
i
shall
keep
it
only
till
you
can
claim
it
when
you
leave
barton
to
form
your
own
establishment
in
a
more
lasting
home
queen
mab
shall
receive
you
this
was
all
overheard
by
miss
dashwood
and
in
the
whole
of
the
sentence
in
his
manner
of
pronouncing
it
and
in
his
addressing
her
sister
by
her
christian
name
alone
she
instantly
saw
an
intimacy
so
decided
a
meaning
so
direct
as
marked
a
perfect
agreement
between
them
from
that
moment
she
doubted
not
of
their
being
engaged
to
each
other
and
the
belief
of
it
created
no
other
surprise
than
that
she
or
any
of
their
friends
should
be
left
by
tempers
so
frank
to
discover
it
by
accident
margaret
related
something
to
her
the
next
day
which
placed
this
matter
in
a
still
clearer
light
willoughby
had
spent
the
preceding
evening
with
them
and
margaret
by
being
left
some
time
in
the
parlour
with
only
him
and
marianne
had
had
opportunity
for
observations
which
with
a
most
important
face
she
communicated
to
her
eldest
sister
when
they
were
next
by
themselves
oh
elinor
she
cried
i
have
such
a
secret
to
tell
you
about
marianne
i
am
sure
she
will
be
married
to
mr
willoughby
very
soon
you
have
said
so
replied
elinor
almost
every
day
since
they
first
met
on
high
church
down
and
they
had
not
known
each
other
a
week
i
believe
before
you
were
certain
that
marianne
wore
his
picture
round
her
neck
but
it
turned
out
to
be
only
the
miniature
of
our
great
uncle
but
indeed
this
is
quite
another
thing
i
am
sure
they
will
be
married
very
soon
for
he
has
got
a
lock
of
her
hair
take
care
margaret
it
may
be
only
the
hair
of
some
great
uncle
of
his
but
indeed
elinor
it
is
marianne
s
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
for
i
saw
him
cut
it
off
last
night
after
tea
when
you
and
mama
went
out
of
the
room
they
were
whispering
and
talking
together
as
fast
as
could
be
and
he
seemed
to
be
begging
something
of
her
and
presently
he
took
up
her
scissors
and
cut
off
a
long
lock
of
her
hair
for
it
was
all
tumbled
down
her
back
and
he
kissed
it
and
folded
it
up
in
a
piece
of
white
paper
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
book
for
such
particulars
stated
on
such
authority
elinor
could
not
withhold
her
credit
nor
was
she
disposed
to
it
for
the
circumstance
was
in
perfect
unison
with
what
she
had
heard
and
seen
herself
margaret
s
sagacity
was
not
always
displayed
in
a
way
so
satisfactory
to
her
sister
when
mrs
jennings
attacked
her
one
evening
at
the
park
to
give
the
name
of
the
young
man
who
was
elinor
s
particular
favourite
which
had
been
long
a
matter
of
great
curiosity
to
her
margaret
answered
by
looking
at
her
sister
and
saying
i
must
not
tell
may
i
elinor
this
of
course
made
every
body
laugh
and
elinor
tried
to
laugh
too
but
the
effort
was
painful
she
was
convinced
that
margaret
had
fixed
on
a
person
whose
name
she
could
not
bear
with
composure
to
become
a
standing
joke
with
mrs
jennings
[illustration
he
cut
off
a
long
lock
of
her
hair
]
marianne
felt
for
her
most
sincerely
but
she
did
more
harm
than
good
to
the
cause
by
turning
very
red
and
saying
in
an
angry
manner
to
margaret
remember
that
whatever
your
conjectures
may
be
you
have
no
right
to
repeat
them
i
never
had
any
conjectures
about
it
replied
margaret
it
was
you
who
told
me
of
it
yourself
this
increased
the
mirth
of
the
company
and
margaret
was
eagerly
pressed
to
say
something
more
oh
pray
miss
margaret
let
us
know
all
about
it
said
mrs
jennings
what
is
the
gentleman
s
name
i
must
not
tell
ma
am
but
i
know
very
well
what
it
is
and
i
know
where
he
is
too
yes
yes
we
can
guess
where
he
is
at
his
own
house
at
norland
to
be
sure
he
is
the
curate
of
the
parish
i
dare
say
no
that
he
is
not
he
is
of
no
profession
at
all
margaret
said
marianne
with
great
warmth
you
know
that
all
this
is
an
invention
of
your
own
and
that
there
is
no
such
person
in
existence
well
then
he
is
lately
dead
marianne
for
i
am
sure
there
was
such
a
man
once
and
his
name
begins
with
an
f
most
grateful
did
elinor
feel
to
lady
middleton
for
observing
at
this
moment
that
it
rained
very
hard
though
she
believed
the
interruption
to
proceed
less
from
any
attention
to
her
than
from
her
ladyship
s
great
dislike
of
all
such
inelegant
subjects
of
raillery
as
delighted
her
husband
and
mother
the
idea
however
started
by
her
was
immediately
pursued
by
colonel
brandon
who
was
on
every
occasion
mindful
of
the
feelings
of
others
and
much
was
said
on
the
subject
of
rain
by
both
of
them
willoughby
opened
the
piano
forte
and
asked
marianne
to
sit
down
to
it
and
thus
amidst
the
various
endeavours
of
different
people
to
quit
the
topic
it
fell
to
the
ground
but
not
so
easily
did
elinor
recover
from
the
alarm
into
which
it
had
thrown
her
a
party
was
formed
this
evening
for
going
on
the
following
day
to
see
a
very
fine
place
about
twelve
miles
from
barton
belonging
to
a
brother
in
law
of
colonel
brandon
without
whose
interest
it
could
not
be
seen
as
the
proprietor
who
was
then
abroad
had
left
strict
orders
on
that
head
the
grounds
were
declared
to
be
highly
beautiful
and
sir
john
who
was
particularly
warm
in
their
praise
might
be
allowed
to
be
a
tolerable
judge
for
he
had
formed
parties
to
visit
them
at
least
twice
every
summer
for
the
last
ten
years
they
contained
a
noble
piece
of
water
a
sail
on
which
was
to
a
form
a
great
part
of
the
morning
s
amusement
cold
provisions
were
to
be
taken
open
carriages
only
to
be
employed
and
every
thing
conducted
in
the
usual
style
of
a
complete
party
of
pleasure
to
some
few
of
the
company
it
appeared
rather
a
bold
undertaking
considering
the
time
of
year
and
that
it
had
rained
every
day
for
the
last
fortnight
and
mrs
dashwood
who
had
already
a
cold
was
persuaded
by
elinor
to
stay
at
home
chapter
xiii
their
intended
excursion
to
whitwell
turned
out
very
different
from
what
elinor
had
expected
she
was
prepared
to
be
wet
through
fatigued
and
frightened
but
the
event
was
still
more
unfortunate
for
they
did
not
go
at
all
by
ten
o
clock
the
whole
party
was
assembled
at
the
park
where
they
were
to
breakfast
the
morning
was
rather
favourable
though
it
had
rained
all
night
as
the
clouds
were
then
dispersing
across
the
sky
and
the
sun
frequently
appeared
they
were
all
in
high
spirits
and
good
humour
eager
to
be
happy
and
determined
to
submit
to
the
greatest
inconveniences
and
hardships
rather
than
be
otherwise
while
they
were
at
breakfast
the
letters
were
brought
in
among
the
rest
there
was
one
for
colonel
brandon
he
took
it
looked
at
the
direction
changed
colour
and
immediately
left
the
room
what
is
the
matter
with
brandon
said
sir
john
nobody
could
tell
i
hope
he
has
had
no
bad
news
said
lady
middleton
it
must
be
something
extraordinary
that
could
make
colonel
brandon
leave
my
breakfast
table
so
suddenly
in
about
five
minutes
he
returned
no
bad
news
colonel
i
hope
said
mrs
jennings
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
none
at
all
ma
am
i
thank
you
was
it
from
avignon
i
hope
it
is
not
to
say
that
your
sister
is
worse
no
ma
am
it
came
from
town
and
is
merely
a
letter
of
business
but
how
came
the
hand
to
discompose
you
so
much
if
it
was
only
a
letter
of
business
come
come
this
won
t
do
colonel
so
let
us
hear
the
truth
of
it
my
dear
madam
said
lady
middleton
recollect
what
you
are
saying
perhaps
it
is
to
tell
you
that
your
cousin
fanny
is
married
said
mrs
jennings
without
attending
to
her
daughter
s
reproof
no
indeed
it
is
not
well
then
i
know
who
it
is
from
colonel
and
i
hope
she
is
well
whom
do
you
mean
ma
am
said
he
colouring
a
little
oh
you
know
who
i
mean
i
am
particularly
sorry
ma
am
said
he
addressing
lady
middleton
that
i
should
receive
this
letter
today
for
it
is
on
business
which
requires
my
immediate
attendance
in
town
in
town
cried
mrs
jennings
what
can
you
have
to
do
in
town
at
this
time
of
year
my
own
loss
is
great
he
continued
in
being
obliged
to
leave
so
agreeable
a
party
but
i
am
the
more
concerned
as
i
fear
my
presence
is
necessary
to
gain
your
admittance
at
whitwell
what
a
blow
upon
them
all
was
this
but
if
you
write
a
note
to
the
housekeeper
mr
brandon
said
marianne
eagerly
will
it
not
be
sufficient
he
shook
his
head
we
must
go
said
sir
john
it
shall
not
be
put
off
when
we
are
so
near
it
you
cannot
go
to
town
till
tomorrow
brandon
that
is
all
i
wish
it
could
be
so
easily
settled
but
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
delay
my
journey
for
one
day
if
you
would
but
let
us
know
what
your
business
is
said
mrs
jennings
we
might
see
whether
it
could
be
put
off
or
not
you
would
not
be
six
hours
later
said
willoughby
if
you
were
to
defer
your
journey
till
our
return
i
cannot
afford
to
lose
one
hour
elinor
then
heard
willoughby
say
in
a
low
voice
to
marianne
there
are
some
people
who
cannot
bear
a
party
of
pleasure
brandon
is
one
of
them
he
was
afraid
of
catching
cold
i
dare
say
and
invented
this
trick
for
getting
out
of
it
i
would
lay
fifty
guineas
the
letter
was
of
his
own
writing
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
replied
marianne
there
is
no
persuading
you
to
change
your
mind
brandon
i
know
of
old
said
sir
john
when
once
you
are
determined
on
anything
but
however
i
hope
you
will
think
better
of
it
consider
here
are
the
two
miss
careys
come
over
from
newton
the
three
miss
dashwoods
walked
up
from
the
cottage
and
mr
willoughby
got
up
two
hours
before
his
usual
time
on
purpose
to
go
to
whitwell
colonel
brandon
again
repeated
his
sorrow
at
being
the
cause
of
disappointing
the
party
but
at
the
same
time
declared
it
to
be
unavoidable
well
then
when
will
you
come
back
again
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
at
barton
added
her
ladyship
as
soon
as
you
can
conveniently
leave
town
and
we
must
put
off
the
party
to
whitwell
till
you
return
you
are
very
obliging
but
it
is
so
uncertain
when
i
may
have
it
in
my
power
to
return
that
i
dare
not
engage
for
it
at
all
oh
he
must
and
shall
come
back
cried
sir
john
if
he
is
not
here
by
the
end
of
the
week
i
shall
go
after
him
ay
so
do
sir
john
cried
mrs
jennings
and
then
perhaps
you
may
find
out
what
his
business
is
i
do
not
want
to
pry
into
other
men
s
concerns
i
suppose
it
is
something
he
is
ashamed
of
colonel
brandon
s
horses
were
announced
you
do
not
go
to
town
on
horseback
do
you
added
sir
john
no
only
to
honiton
i
shall
then
go
post
well
as
you
are
resolved
to
go
i
wish
you
a
good
journey
but
you
had
better
change
your
mind
i
assure
you
it
is
not
in
my
power
he
then
took
leave
of
the
whole
party
is
there
no
chance
of
my
seeing
you
and
your
sisters
in
town
this
winter
miss
dashwood
i
am
afraid
none
at
all
then
i
must
bid
you
farewell
for
a
longer
time
than
i
should
wish
to
do
to
marianne
he
merely
bowed
and
said
nothing
come
colonel
said
mrs
jennings
before
you
go
do
let
us
know
what
you
are
going
about
he
wished
her
a
good
morning
and
attended
by
sir
john
left
the
room
the
complaints
and
lamentations
which
politeness
had
hitherto
restrained
now
burst
forth
universally
and
they
all
agreed
again
and
again
how
provoking
it
was
to
be
so
disappointed
i
can
guess
what
his
business
is
however
said
mrs
jennings
exultingly
can
you
ma
am
said
almost
every
body
yes
it
is
about
miss
williams
i
am
sure
and
who
is
miss
williams
asked
marianne
what
do
not
you
know
who
miss
williams
is
i
am
sure
you
must
have
heard
of
her
before
she
is
a
relation
of
the
colonel
s
my
dear
a
very
near
relation
we
will
not
say
how
near
for
fear
of
shocking
the
young
ladies
then
lowering
her
voice
a
little
she
said
to
elinor
she
is
his
natural
daughter
indeed
oh
yes
and
as
like
him
as
she
can
stare
i
dare
say
the
colonel
will
leave
her
all
his
fortune
when
sir
john
returned
he
joined
most
heartily
in
the
general
regret
on
so
unfortunate
an
event
concluding
however
by
observing
that
as
they
were
all
got
together
they
must
do
something
by
way
of
being
happy
and
after
some
consultation
it
was
agreed
that
although
happiness
could
only
be
enjoyed
at
whitwell
they
might
procure
a
tolerable
composure
of
mind
by
driving
about
the
country
the
carriages
were
then
ordered
willoughby
s
was
first
and
marianne
never
looked
happier
than
when
she
got
into
it
he
drove
through
the
park
very
fast
and
they
were
soon
out
of
sight
and
nothing
more
of
them
was
seen
till
their
return
which
did
not
happen
till
after
the
return
of
all
the
rest
they
both
seemed
delighted
with
their
drive
but
said
only
in
general
terms
that
they
had
kept
in
the
lanes
while
the
others
went
on
the
downs
it
was
settled
that
there
should
be
a
dance
in
the
evening
and
that
every
body
should
be
extremely
merry
all
day
long
some
more
of
the
careys
came
to
dinner
and
they
had
the
pleasure
of
sitting
down
nearly
twenty
to
table
which
sir
john
observed
with
great
contentment
willoughby
took
his
usual
place
between
the
two
elder
miss
dashwoods
mrs
jennings
sat
on
elinor
s
right
hand
and
they
had
not
been
long
seated
before
she
leant
behind
her
and
willoughby
and
said
to
marianne
loud
enough
for
them
both
to
hear
i
have
found
you
out
in
spite
of
all
your
tricks
i
know
where
you
spent
the
morning
marianne
coloured
and
replied
very
hastily
where
pray
did
not
you
know
said
willoughby
that
we
had
been
out
in
my
curricle
yes
yes
mr
impudence
i
know
that
very
well
and
i
was
determined
to
find
out
where
you
had
been
to
i
hope
you
like
your
house
miss
marianne
it
is
a
very
large
one
i
know
and
when
i
come
to
see
you
i
hope
you
will
have
new
furnished
it
for
it
wanted
it
very
much
when
i
was
there
six
years
ago
marianne
turned
away
in
great
confusion
mrs
jennings
laughed
heartily
and
elinor
found
that
in
her
resolution
to
know
where
they
had
been
she
had
actually
made
her
own
woman
enquire
of
mr
willoughby
s
groom
and
that
she
had
by
that
method
been
informed
that
they
had
gone
to
allenham
and
spent
a
considerable
time
there
in
walking
about
the
garden
and
going
all
over
the
house
elinor
could
hardly
believe
this
to
be
true
as
it
seemed
very
unlikely
that
willoughby
should
propose
or
marianne
consent
to
enter
the
house
while
mrs
smith
was
in
it
with
whom
marianne
had
not
the
smallest
acquaintance
as
soon
as
they
left
the
dining
room
elinor
enquired
of
her
about
it
and
great
was
her
surprise
when
she
found
that
every
circumstance
related
by
mrs
jennings
was
perfectly
true
marianne
was
quite
angry
with
her
for
doubting
it
why
should
you
imagine
elinor
that
we
did
not
go
there
or
that
we
did
not
see
the
house
is
not
it
what
you
have
often
wished
to
do
yourself
yes
marianne
but
i
would
not
go
while
mrs
smith
was
there
and
with
no
other
companion
than
mr
willoughby
[illustration
i
have
found
you
out
in
spite
of
all
your
tricks
]
mr
willoughby
however
is
the
only
person
who
can
have
a
right
to
show
that
house
and
as
he
went
in
an
open
carriage
it
was
impossible
to
have
any
other
companion
i
never
spent
a
pleasanter
morning
in
my
life
i
am
afraid
replied
elinor
that
the
pleasantness
of
an
employment
does
not
always
evince
its
propriety
on
the
contrary
nothing
can
be
a
stronger
proof
of
it
elinor
for
if
there
had
been
any
real
impropriety
in
what
i
did
i
should
have
been
sensible
of
it
at
the
time
for
we
always
know
when
we
are
acting
wrong
and
with
such
a
conviction
i
could
have
had
no
pleasure
but
my
dear
marianne
as
it
has
already
exposed
you
to
some
very
impertinent
remarks
do
you
not
now
begin
to
doubt
the
discretion
of
your
own
conduct
if
the
impertinent
remarks
of
mrs
jennings
are
to
be
the
proof
of
impropriety
in
conduct
we
are
all
offending
every
moment
of
our
lives
i
value
not
her
censure
any
more
than
i
should
do
her
commendation
i
am
not
sensible
of
having
done
anything
wrong
in
walking
over
mrs
smith
s
grounds
or
in
seeing
her
house
they
will
one
day
be
mr
willoughby
s
and
if
they
were
one
day
to
be
your
own
marianne
you
would
not
be
justified
in
what
you
have
done
she
blushed
at
this
hint
but
it
was
even
visibly
gratifying
to
her
and
after
a
ten
minutes
interval
of
earnest
thought
she
came
to
her
sister
again
and
said
with
great
good
humour
perhaps
elinor
it
was
rather
ill
judged
in
me
to
go
to
allenham
but
mr
willoughby
wanted
particularly
to
show
me
the
place
and
it
is
a
charming
house
i
assure
you
there
is
one
remarkably
pretty
sitting
room
up
stairs
of
a
nice
comfortable
size
for
constant
use
and
with
modern
furniture
it
would
be
delightful
it
is
a
corner
room
and
has
windows
on
two
sides
on
one
side
you
look
across
the
bowling
green
behind
the
house
to
a
beautiful
hanging
wood
and
on
the
other
you
have
a
view
of
the
church
and
village
and
beyond
them
of
those
fine
bold
hills
that
we
have
so
often
admired
i
did
not
see
it
to
advantage
for
nothing
could
be
more
forlorn
than
the
furniture
but
if
it
were
newly
fitted
up
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
willoughby
says
would
make
it
one
of
the
pleasantest
summer
rooms
in
england
could
elinor
have
listened
to
her
without
interruption
from
the
others
she
would
have
described
every
room
in
the
house
with
equal
delight
chapter
xiv
the
sudden
termination
of
colonel
brandon
s
visit
at
the
park
with
his
steadiness
in
concealing
its
cause
filled
the
mind
and
raised
the
wonder
of
mrs
jennings
for
two
or
three
days
she
was
a
great
wonderer
as
every
one
must
be
who
takes
a
very
lively
interest
in
all
the
comings
and
goings
of
all
their
acquaintance
she
wondered
with
little
intermission
what
could
be
the
reason
of
it
was
sure
there
must
be
some
bad
news
and
thought
over
every
kind
of
distress
that
could
have
befallen
him
with
a
fixed
determination
that
he
should
not
escape
them
all
something
very
melancholy
must
be
the
matter
i
am
sure
said
she
i
could
see
it
in
his
face
poor
man
i
am
afraid
his
circumstances
may
be
bad
the
estate
at
delaford
was
never
reckoned
more
than
two
thousand
a
year
and
his
brother
left
everything
sadly
involved
i
do
think
he
must
have
been
sent
for
about
money
matters
for
what
else
can
it
be
i
wonder
whether
it
is
so
i
would
give
anything
to
know
the
truth
of
it
perhaps
it
is
about
miss
williams
and
by
the
bye
i
dare
say
it
is
because
he
looked
so
conscious
when
i
mentioned
her
may
be
she
is
ill
in
town
nothing
in
the
world
more
likely
for
i
have
a
notion
she
is
always
rather
sickly
i
would
lay
any
wager
it
is
about
miss
williams
it
is
not
so
very
likely
he
should
be
distressed
in
his
circumstances
now
for
he
is
a
very
prudent
man
and
to
be
sure
must
have
cleared
the
estate
by
this
time
i
wonder
what
it
can
be
may
be
his
sister
is
worse
at
avignon
and
has
sent
for
him
over
his
setting
off
in
such
a
hurry
seems
very
like
it
well
i
wish
him
out
of
all
his
trouble
with
all
my
heart
and
a
good
wife
into
the
bargain
so
wondered
so
talked
mrs
jennings
her
opinion
varying
with
every
fresh
conjecture
and
all
seeming
equally
probable
as
they
arose
elinor
though
she
felt
really
interested
in
the
welfare
of
colonel
brandon
could
not
bestow
all
the
wonder
on
his
going
so
suddenly
away
which
mrs
jennings
was
desirous
of
her
feeling
for
besides
that
the
circumstance
did
not
in
her
opinion
justify
such
lasting
amazement
or
variety
of
speculation
her
wonder
was
otherwise
disposed
of
it
was
engrossed
by
the
extraordinary
silence
of
her
sister
and
willoughby
on
the
subject
which
they
must
know
to
be
peculiarly
interesting
to
them
all
as
this
silence
continued
every
day
made
it
appear
more
strange
and
more
incompatible
with
the
disposition
of
both
why
they
should
not
openly
acknowledge
to
her
mother
and
herself
what
their
constant
behaviour
to
each
other
declared
to
have
taken
place
elinor
could
not
imagine
she
could
easily
conceive
that
marriage
might
not
be
immediately
in
their
power
for
though
willoughby
was
independent
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
him
rich
his
estate
had
been
rated
by
sir
john
at
about
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
but
he
lived
at
an
expense
to
which
that
income
could
hardly
be
equal
and
he
had
himself
often
complained
of
his
poverty
but
for
this
strange
kind
of
secrecy
maintained
by
them
relative
to
their
engagement
which
in
fact
concealed
nothing
at
all
she
could
not
account
and
it
was
so
wholly
contradictory
to
their
general
opinions
and
practice
that
a
doubt
sometimes
entered
her
mind
of
their
being
really
engaged
and
this
doubt
was
enough
to
prevent
her
making
any
inquiry
of
marianne
nothing
could
be
more
expressive
of
attachment
to
them
all
than
willoughby
s
behaviour
to
marianne
it
had
all
the
distinguishing
tenderness
which
a
lover
s
heart
could
give
and
to
the
rest
of
the
family
it
was
the
affectionate
attention
of
a
son
and
a
brother
the
cottage
seemed
to
be
considered
and
loved
by
him
as
his
home
many
more
of
his
hours
were
spent
there
than
at
allenham
and
if
no
general
engagement
collected
them
at
the
park
the
exercise
which
called
him
out
in
the
morning
was
almost
certain
of
ending
there
where
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
by
himself
at
the
side
of
marianne
and
by
his
favourite
pointer
at
her
feet
one
evening
in
particular
about
a
week
after
colonel
brandon
left
the
country
his
heart
seemed
more
than
usually
open
to
every
feeling
of
attachment
to
the
objects
around
him
and
on
mrs
dashwood
s
happening
to
mention
her
design
of
improving
the
cottage
in
the
spring
he
warmly
opposed
every
alteration
of
a
place
which
affection
had
established
as
perfect
with
him
what
he
exclaimed
improve
this
dear
cottage
no
that
i
will
never
consent
to
not
a
stone
must
be
added
to
its
walls
not
an
inch
to
its
size
if
my
feelings
are
regarded
do
not
be
alarmed
said
miss
dashwood
nothing
of
the
kind
will
be
done
for
my
mother
will
never
have
money
enough
to
attempt
it
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
he
cried
may
she
always
be
poor
if
she
can
employ
her
riches
no
better
thank
you
willoughby
but
you
may
be
assured
that
i
would
not
sacrifice
one
sentiment
of
local
attachment
of
yours
or
of
any
one
whom
i
loved
for
all
the
improvements
in
the
world
depend
upon
it
that
whatever
unemployed
sum
may
remain
when
i
make
up
my
accounts
in
the
spring
i
would
even
rather
lay
it
uselessly
by
than
dispose
of
it
in
a
manner
so
painful
to
you
but
are
you
really
so
attached
to
this
place
as
to
see
no
defect
in
it
i
am
said
he
to
me
it
is
faultless
nay
more
i
consider
it
as
the
only
form
of
building
in
which
happiness
is
attainable
and
were
i
rich
enough
i
would
instantly
pull
combe
down
and
build
it
up
again
in
the
exact
plan
of
this
cottage
with
dark
narrow
stairs
and
a
kitchen
that
smokes
i
suppose
said
elinor
yes
cried
he
in
the
same
eager
tone
with
all
and
every
thing
belonging
to
it
in
no
one
convenience
or
inconvenience
about
it
should
the
least
variation
be
perceptible
then
and
then
only
under
such
a
roof
i
might
perhaps
be
as
happy
at
combe
as
i
have
been
at
barton
i
flatter
myself
replied
elinor
that
even
under
the
disadvantage
of
better
rooms
and
a
broader
staircase
you
will
hereafter
find
your
own
house
as
faultless
as
you
now
do
this
there
certainly
are
circumstances
said
willoughby
which
might
greatly
endear
it
to
me
but
this
place
will
always
have
one
claim
of
my
affection
which
no
other
can
possibly
share
mrs
dashwood
looked
with
pleasure
at
marianne
whose
fine
eyes
were
fixed
so
expressively
on
willoughby
as
plainly
denoted
how
well
she
understood
him
how
often
did
i
wish
added
he
when
i
was
at
allenham
this
time
twelvemonth
that
barton
cottage
were
inhabited
i
never
passed
within
view
of
it
without
admiring
its
situation
and
grieving
that
no
one
should
live
in
it
how
little
did
i
then
think
that
the
very
first
news
i
should
hear
from
mrs
smith
when
i
next
came
into
the
country
would
be
that
barton
cottage
was
taken
and
i
felt
an
immediate
satisfaction
and
interest
in
the
event
which
nothing
but
a
kind
of
prescience
of
what
happiness
i
should
experience
from
it
can
account
for
must
it
not
have
been
so
marianne
speaking
to
her
in
a
lowered
voice
then
continuing
his
former
tone
he
said
and
yet
this
house
you
would
spoil
mrs
dashwood
you
would
rob
it
of
its
simplicity
by
imaginary
improvement
and
this
dear
parlour
in
which
our
acquaintance
first
began
and
in
which
so
many
happy
hours
have
been
since
spent
by
us
together
you
would
degrade
to
the
condition
of
a
common
entrance
and
every
body
would
be
eager
to
pass
through
the
room
which
has
hitherto
contained
within
itself
more
real
accommodation
and
comfort
than
any
other
apartment
of
the
handsomest
dimensions
in
the
world
could
possibly
afford
mrs
dashwood
again
assured
him
that
no
alteration
of
the
kind
should
be
attempted
you
are
a
good
woman
he
warmly
replied
your
promise
makes
me
easy
extend
it
a
little
farther
and
it
will
make
me
happy
tell
me
that
not
only
your
house
will
remain
the
same
but
that
i
shall
ever
find
you
and
yours
as
unchanged
as
your
dwelling
and
that
you
will
always
consider
me
with
the
kindness
which
has
made
everything
belonging
to
you
so
dear
to
me
the
promise
was
readily
given
and
willoughby
s
behaviour
during
the
whole
of
the
evening
declared
at
once
his
affection
and
happiness
shall
we
see
you
tomorrow
to
dinner
said
mrs
dashwood
when
he
was
leaving
them
i
do
not
ask
you
to
come
in
the
morning
for
we
must
walk
to
the
park
to
call
on
lady
middleton
he
engaged
to
be
with
them
by
four
o
clock
chapter
xv
mrs
dashwood
s
visit
to
lady
middleton
took
place
the
next
day
and
two
of
her
daughters
went
with
her
but
marianne
excused
herself
from
being
of
the
party
under
some
trifling
pretext
of
employment
and
her
mother
who
concluded
that
a
promise
had
been
made
by
willoughby
the
night
before
of
calling
on
her
while
they
were
absent
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
remaining
at
home
on
their
return
from
the
park
they
found
willoughby
s
curricle
and
servant
in
waiting
at
the
cottage
and
mrs
dashwood
was
convinced
that
her
conjecture
had
been
just
so
far
it
was
all
as
she
had
foreseen
but
on
entering
the
house
she
beheld
what
no
foresight
had
taught
her
to
expect
they
were
no
sooner
in
the
passage
than
marianne
came
hastily
out
of
the
parlour
apparently
in
violent
affliction
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
and
without
noticing
them
ran
up
stairs
surprised
and
alarmed
they
proceeded
directly
into
the
room
she
had
just
quitted
where
they
found
only
willoughby
who
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
with
his
back
towards
them
he
turned
round
on
their
coming
in
and
his
countenance
showed
that
he
strongly
partook
of
the
emotion
which
overpowered
marianne
is
anything
the
matter
with
her
cried
mrs
dashwood
as
she
entered
is
she
ill
i
hope
not
he
replied
trying
to
look
cheerful
and
with
a
forced
smile
presently
added
it
is
i
who
may
rather
expect
to
be
ill
for
i
am
now
suffering
under
a
very
heavy
disappointment
disappointment
yes
for
i
am
unable
to
keep
my
engagement
with
you
mrs
smith
has
this
morning
exercised
the
privilege
of
riches
upon
a
poor
dependent
cousin
by
sending
me
on
business
to
london
i
have
just
received
my
dispatches
and
taken
my
farewell
of
allenham
and
by
way
of
exhilaration
i
am
now
come
to
take
my
farewell
of
you
to
london
and
are
you
going
this
morning
almost
this
moment
[illustration
apparently
in
violent
affliction
]
this
is
very
unfortunate
but
mrs
smith
must
be
obliged
and
her
business
will
not
detain
you
from
us
long
i
hope
he
coloured
as
he
replied
you
are
very
kind
but
i
have
no
idea
of
returning
into
devonshire
immediately
my
visits
to
mrs
smith
are
never
repeated
within
the
twelvemonth
and
is
mrs
smith
your
only
friend
is
allenham
the
only
house
in
the
neighbourhood
to
which
you
will
be
welcome
for
shame
willoughby
can
you
wait
for
an
invitation
here
his
colour
increased
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
he
only
replied
you
are
too
good
mrs
dashwood
looked
at
elinor
with
surprise
elinor
felt
equal
amazement
for
a
few
moments
every
one
was
silent
mrs
dashwood
first
spoke
i
have
only
to
add
my
dear
willoughby
that
at
barton
cottage
you
will
always
be
welcome
for
i
will
not
press
you
to
return
here
immediately
because
you
only
can
judge
how
far
that
might
be
pleasing
to
mrs
smith
and
on
this
head
i
shall
be
no
more
disposed
to
question
your
judgment
than
to
doubt
your
inclination
my
engagements
at
present
replied
willoughby
confusedly
are
of
such
a
nature
that
i
dare
not
flatter
myself
he
stopped
mrs
dashwood
was
too
much
astonished
to
speak
and
another
pause
succeeded
this
was
broken
by
willoughby
who
said
with
a
faint
smile
it
is
folly
to
linger
in
this
manner
i
will
not
torment
myself
any
longer
by
remaining
among
friends
whose
society
it
is
impossible
for
me
now
to
enjoy
he
then
hastily
took
leave
of
them
all
and
left
the
room
they
saw
him
step
into
his
carriage
and
in
a
minute
it
was
out
of
sight
mrs
dashwood
felt
too
much
for
speech
and
instantly
quitted
the
parlour
to
give
way
in
solitude
to
the
concern
and
alarm
which
this
sudden
departure
occasioned
elinor
s
uneasiness
was
at
least
equal
to
her
mother
s
she
thought
of
what
had
just
passed
with
anxiety
and
distrust
willoughby
s
behaviour
in
taking
leave
of
them
his
embarrassment
and
affectation
of
cheerfulness
and
above
all
his
unwillingness
to
accept
her
mother
s
invitation
a
backwardness
so
unlike
a
lover
so
unlike
himself
greatly
disturbed
her
one
moment
she
feared
that
no
serious
design
had
ever
been
formed
on
his
side
and
the
next
that
some
unfortunate
quarrel
had
taken
place
between
him
and
her
sister
the
distress
in
which
marianne
had
quitted
the
room
was
such
as
a
serious
quarrel
could
most
reasonably
account
for
though
when
she
considered
what
marianne
s
love
for
him
was
a
quarrel
seemed
almost
impossible
but
whatever
might
be
the
particulars
of
their
separation
her
sister
s
affliction
was
indubitable
and
she
thought
with
the
tenderest
compassion
of
that
violent
sorrow
which
marianne
was
in
all
probability
not
merely
giving
way
to
as
a
relief
but
feeding
and
encouraging
as
a
duty
in
about
half
an
hour
her
mother
returned
and
though
her
eyes
were
red
her
countenance
was
not
uncheerful
our
dear
willoughby
is
now
some
miles
from
barton
elinor
said
she
as
she
sat
down
to
work
and
with
how
heavy
a
heart
does
he
travel
it
is
all
very
strange
so
suddenly
to
be
gone
it
seems
but
the
work
of
a
moment
and
last
night
he
was
with
us
so
happy
so
cheerful
so
affectionate
and
now
after
only
ten
minutes
notice
gone
too
without
intending
to
return
something
more
than
what
he
owned
to
us
must
have
happened
he
did
not
speak
he
did
not
behave
like
himself
you
must
have
seen
the
difference
as
well
as
i
what
can
it
be
can
they
have
quarrelled
why
else
should
he
have
shown
such
unwillingness
to
accept
your
invitation
here
it
was
not
inclination
that
he
wanted
elinor
i
could
plainly
see
that
he
had
not
the
power
of
accepting
it
i
have
thought
it
all
over
i
assure
you
and
i
can
perfectly
account
for
every
thing
that
at
first
seemed
strange
to
me
as
well
as
to
you
can
you
indeed
yes
i
have
explained
it
to
myself
in
the
most
satisfactory
way
but
you
elinor
who
love
to
doubt
where
you
can
it
will
not
satisfy
you
i
know
but
you
shall
not
talk
me
out
of
my
trust
in
it
i
am
persuaded
that
mrs
smith
suspects
his
regard
for
marianne
disapproves
of
it
perhaps
because
she
has
other
views
for
him
and
on
that
account
is
eager
to
get
him
away
and
that
the
business
which
she
sends
him
off
to
transact
is
invented
as
an
excuse
to
dismiss
him
this
is
what
i
believe
to
have
happened
he
is
moreover
aware
that
she
does
disapprove
the
connection
he
dares
not
therefore
at
present
confess
to
her
his
engagement
with
marianne
and
he
feels
himself
obliged
from
his
dependent
situation
to
give
into
her
schemes
and
absent
himself
from
devonshire
for
a
while
you
will
tell
me
i
know
that
this
may
or
may
not
have
happened
but
i
will
listen
to
no
cavil
unless
you
can
point
out
any
other
method
of
understanding
the
affair
as
satisfactory
at
this
and
now
elinor
what
have
you
to
say
nothing
for
you
have
anticipated
my
answer
then
you
would
have
told
me
that
it
might
or
might
not
have
happened
oh
elinor
how
incomprehensible
are
your
feelings
you
had
rather
take
evil
upon
credit
than
good
you
had
rather
look
out
for
misery
for
marianne
and
guilt
for
poor
willoughby
than
an
apology
for
the
latter
you
are
resolved
to
think
him
blamable
because
he
took
leave
of
us
with
less
affection
than
his
usual
behaviour
has
shown
and
is
no
allowance
to
be
made
for
inadvertence
or
for
spirits
depressed
by
recent
disappointment
are
no
probabilities
to
be
accepted
merely
because
they
are
not
certainties
is
nothing
due
to
the
man
whom
we
have
all
such
reason
to
love
and
no
reason
in
the
world
to
think
ill
of
to
the
possibility
of
motives
unanswerable
in
themselves
though
unavoidably
secret
for
a
while
and
after
all
what
is
it
you
suspect
him
of
i
can
hardly
tell
myself
but
suspicion
of
something
unpleasant
is
the
inevitable
consequence
of
such
an
alteration
as
we
just
witnessed
in
him
there
is
great
truth
however
in
what
you
have
now
urged
of
the
allowances
which
ought
to
be
made
for
him
and
it
is
my
wish
to
be
candid
in
my
judgment
of
every
body
willoughby
may
undoubtedly
have
very
sufficient
reasons
for
his
conduct
and
i
will
hope
that
he
has
but
it
would
have
been
more
like
willoughby
to
acknowledge
them
at
once
secrecy
may
be
advisable
but
still
i
cannot
help
wondering
at
its
being
practiced
by
him
do
not
blame
him
however
for
departing
from
his
character
where
the
deviation
is
necessary
but
you
really
do
admit
the
justice
of
what
i
have
said
in
his
defence
i
am
happy
and
he
is
acquitted
not
entirely
it
may
be
proper
to
conceal
their
engagement
if
they
are
engaged
from
mrs
smith
and
if
that
is
the
case
it
must
be
highly
expedient
for
willoughby
to
be
but
little
in
devonshire
at
present
but
this
is
no
excuse
for
their
concealing
it
from
us
concealing
it
from
us
my
dear
child
do
you
accuse
willoughby
and
marianne
of
concealment
this
is
strange
indeed
when
your
eyes
have
been
reproaching
them
every
day
for
incautiousness
i
want
no
proof
of
their
affection
said
elinor
but
of
their
engagement
i
do
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
of
both
yet
not
a
syllable
has
been
said
to
you
on
the
subject
by
either
of
them
i
have
not
wanted
syllables
where
actions
have
spoken
so
plainly
has
not
his
behaviour
to
marianne
and
to
all
of
us
for
at
least
the
last
fortnight
declared
that
he
loved
and
considered
her
as
his
future
wife
and
that
he
felt
for
us
the
attachment
of
the
nearest
relation
have
we
not
perfectly
understood
each
other
has
not
my
consent
been
daily
asked
by
his
looks
his
manner
his
attentive
and
affectionate
respect
my
elinor
is
it
possible
to
doubt
their
engagement
how
could
such
a
thought
occur
to
you
how
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
willoughby
persuaded
as
he
must
be
of
your
sister
s
love
should
leave
her
and
leave
her
perhaps
for
months
without
telling
her
of
his
affection
that
they
should
part
without
a
mutual
exchange
of
confidence
i
confess
replied
elinor
that
every
circumstance
except
one
is
in
favour
of
their
engagement
but
that
one
is
the
total
silence
of
both
on
the
subject
and
with
me
it
almost
outweighs
every
other
how
strange
this
is
you
must
think
wretchedly
indeed
of
willoughby
if
after
all
that
has
openly
passed
between
them
you
can
doubt
the
nature
of
the
terms
on
which
they
are
together
has
he
been
acting
a
part
in
his
behaviour
to
your
sister
all
this
time
do
you
suppose
him
really
indifferent
to
her
no
i
cannot
think
that
he
must
and
does
love
her
i
am
sure
but
with
a
strange
kind
of
tenderness
if
he
can
leave
her
with
such
indifference
such
carelessness
of
the
future
as
you
attribute
to
him
you
must
remember
my
dear
mother
that
i
have
never
considered
this
matter
as
certain
i
have
had
my
doubts
i
confess
but
they
are
fainter
than
they
were
and
they
may
soon
be
entirely
done
away
if
we
find
they
correspond
every
fear
of
mine
will
be
removed
a
mighty
concession
indeed
if
you
were
to
see
them
at
the
altar
you
would
suppose
they
were
going
to
be
married
ungracious
girl
but
i
require
no
such
proof
nothing
in
my
opinion
has
ever
passed
to
justify
doubt
no
secrecy
has
been
attempted
all
has
been
uniformly
open
and
unreserved
you
cannot
doubt
your
sister
s
wishes
it
must
be
willoughby
therefore
whom
you
suspect
but
why
is
he
not
a
man
of
honour
and
feeling
has
there
been
any
inconsistency
on
his
side
to
create
alarm
can
he
be
deceitful
i
hope
not
i
believe
not
cried
elinor
i
love
willoughby
sincerely
love
him
and
suspicion
of
his
integrity
cannot
be
more
painful
to
yourself
than
to
me
it
has
been
involuntary
and
i
will
not
encourage
it
i
was
startled
i
confess
by
the
alteration
in
his
manners
this
morning
he
did
not
speak
like
himself
and
did
not
return
your
kindness
with
any
cordiality
but
all
this
may
be
explained
by
such
a
situation
of
his
affairs
as
you
have
supposed
he
had
just
parted
from
my
sister
had
seen
her
leave
him
in
the
greatest
affliction
and
if
he
felt
obliged
from
a
fear
of
offending
mrs
smith
to
resist
the
temptation
of
returning
here
soon
and
yet
aware
that
by
declining
your
invitation
by
saying
that
he
was
going
away
for
some
time
he
should
seem
to
act
an
ungenerous
a
suspicious
part
by
our
family
he
might
well
be
embarrassed
and
disturbed
in
such
a
case
a
plain
and
open
avowal
of
his
difficulties
would
have
been
more
to
his
honour
i
think
as
well
as
more
consistent
with
his
general
character
but
i
will
not
raise
objections
against
any
one
s
conduct
on
so
illiberal
a
foundation
as
a
difference
in
judgment
from
myself
or
a
deviation
from
what
i
may
think
right
and
consistent
you
speak
very
properly
willoughby
certainly
does
not
deserve
to
be
suspected
though
we
have
not
known
him
long
he
is
no
stranger
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
who
has
ever
spoken
to
his
disadvantage
had
he
been
in
a
situation
to
act
independently
and
marry
immediately
it
might
have
been
odd
that
he
should
leave
us
without
acknowledging
everything
to
me
at
once
but
this
is
not
the
case
it
is
an
engagement
in
some
respects
not
prosperously
begun
for
their
marriage
must
be
at
a
very
uncertain
distance
and
even
secrecy
as
far
as
it
can
be
observed
may
now
be
very
advisable
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
margaret
and
elinor
was
then
at
liberty
to
think
over
the
representations
of
her
mother
to
acknowledge
the
probability
of
many
and
hope
for
the
justice
of
all
they
saw
nothing
of
marianne
till
dinner
time
when
she
entered
the
room
and
took
her
place
at
the
table
without
saying
a
word
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
and
it
seemed
as
if
her
tears
were
even
then
restrained
with
difficulty
she
avoided
the
looks
of
them
all
could
neither
eat
nor
speak
and
after
some
time
on
her
mother
s
silently
pressing
her
hand
with
tender
compassion
her
small
degree
of
fortitude
was
quite
overcome
she
burst
into
tears
and
left
the
room
this
violent
oppression
of
spirits
continued
the
whole
evening
she
was
without
any
power
because
she
was
without
any
desire
of
command
over
herself
the
slightest
mention
of
anything
relative
to
willoughby
overpowered
her
in
an
instant
and
though
her
family
were
most
anxiously
attentive
to
her
comfort
it
was
impossible
for
them
if
they
spoke
at
all
to
keep
clear
of
every
subject
which
her
feelings
connected
with
him
chapter
xvi
marianne
would
have
thought
herself
very
inexcusable
had
she
been
able
to
sleep
at
all
the
first
night
after
parting
from
willoughby
she
would
have
been
ashamed
to
look
her
family
in
the
face
the
next
morning
had
she
not
risen
from
her
bed
in
more
need
of
repose
than
when
she
lay
down
in
it
but
the
feelings
which
made
such
composure
a
disgrace
left
her
in
no
danger
of
incurring
it
she
was
awake
the
whole
night
and
she
wept
the
greatest
part
of
it
she
got
up
with
a
headache
was
unable
to
talk
and
unwilling
to
take
any
nourishment
giving
pain
every
moment
to
her
mother
and
sisters
and
forbidding
all
attempt
at
consolation
from
either
her
sensibility
was
potent
enough
when
breakfast
was
over
she
walked
out
by
herself
and
wandered
about
the
village
of
allenham
indulging
the
recollection
of
past
enjoyment
and
crying
over
the
present
reverse
for
the
chief
of
the
morning
the
evening
passed
off
in
the
equal
indulgence
of
feeling
she
played
over
every
favourite
song
that
she
had
been
used
to
play
to
willoughby
every
air
in
which
their
voices
had
been
oftenest
joined
and
sat
at
the
instrument
gazing
on
every
line
of
music
that
he
had
written
out
for
her
till
her
heart
was
so
heavy
that
no
farther
sadness
could
be
gained
and
this
nourishment
of
grief
was
every
day
applied
she
spent
whole
hours
at
the
pianoforte
alternately
singing
and
crying
her
voice
often
totally
suspended
by
her
tears
in
books
too
as
well
as
in
music
she
courted
the
misery
which
a
contrast
between
the
past
and
present
was
certain
of
giving
she
read
nothing
but
what
they
had
been
used
to
read
together
such
violence
of
affliction
indeed
could
not
be
supported
for
ever
it
sunk
within
a
few
days
into
a
calmer
melancholy
but
these
employments
to
which
she
daily
recurred
her
solitary
walks
and
silent
meditations
still
produced
occasional
effusions
of
sorrow
as
lively
as
ever
no
letter
from
willoughby
came
and
none
seemed
expected
by
marianne
her
mother
was
surprised
and
elinor
again
became
uneasy
but
mrs
dashwood
could
find
explanations
whenever
she
wanted
them
which
at
least
satisfied
herself
remember
elinor
said
she
how
very
often
sir
john
fetches
our
letters
himself
from
the
post
and
carries
them
to
it
we
have
already
agreed
that
secrecy
may
be
necessary
and
we
must
acknowledge
that
it
could
not
be
maintained
if
their
correspondence
were
to
pass
through
sir
john
s
hands
elinor
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
this
and
she
tried
to
find
in
it
a
motive
sufficient
for
their
silence
but
there
was
one
method
so
direct
so
simple
and
in
her
opinion
so
eligible
of
knowing
the
real
state
of
the
affair
and
of
instantly
removing
all
mystery
that
she
could
not
help
suggesting
it
to
her
mother
why
do
you
not
ask
marianne
at
once
said
she
whether
she
is
or
she
is
not
engaged
to
willoughby
from
you
her
mother
and
so
kind
so
indulgent
a
mother
the
question
could
not
give
offence
it
would
be
the
natural
result
of
your
affection
for
her
she
used
to
be
all
unreserve
and
to
you
more
especially
i
would
not
ask
such
a
question
for
the
world
supposing
it
possible
that
they
are
not
engaged
what
distress
would
not
such
an
enquiry
inflict
at
any
rate
it
would
be
most
ungenerous
i
should
never
deserve
her
confidence
again
after
forcing
from
her
a
confession
of
what
is
meant
at
present
to
be
unacknowledged
to
any
one
i
know
marianne
s
heart
i
know
that
she
dearly
loves
me
and
that
i
shall
not
be
the
last
to
whom
the
affair
is
made
known
when
circumstances
make
the
revealment
of
it
eligible
i
would
not
attempt
to
force
the
confidence
of
any
one
of
a
child
much
less
because
a
sense
of
duty
would
prevent
the
denial
which
her
wishes
might
direct
elinor
thought
this
generosity
overstrained
considering
her
sister
s
youth
and
urged
the
matter
farther
but
in
vain
common
sense
common
care
common
prudence
were
all
sunk
in
mrs
dashwood
s
romantic
delicacy
it
was
several
days
before
willoughby
s
name
was
mentioned
before
marianne
by
any
of
her
family
sir
john
and
mrs
jennings
indeed
were
not
so
nice
their
witticisms
added
pain
to
many
a
painful
hour
but
one
evening
mrs
dashwood
accidentally
taking
up
a
volume
of
shakespeare
exclaimed
we
have
never
finished
hamlet
marianne
our
dear
willoughby
went
away
before
we
could
get
through
it
we
will
put
it
by
that
when
he
comes
again
but
it
may
be
months
perhaps
before
that
happens
months
cried
marianne
with
strong
surprise
no
nor
many
weeks
mrs
dashwood
was
sorry
for
what
she
had
said
but
it
gave
elinor
pleasure
as
it
produced
a
reply
from
marianne
so
expressive
of
confidence
in
willoughby
and
knowledge
of
his
intentions
one
morning
about
a
week
after
his
leaving
the
country
marianne
was
prevailed
on
to
join
her
sisters
in
their
usual
walk
instead
of
wandering
away
by
herself
hitherto
she
had
carefully
avoided
every
companion
in
her
rambles
if
her
sisters
intended
to
walk
on
the
downs
she
directly
stole
away
towards
the
lanes
if
they
talked
of
the
valley
she
was
as
speedy
in
climbing
the
hills
and
could
never
be
found
when
the
others
set
off
but
at
length
she
was
secured
by
the
exertions
of
elinor
who
greatly
disapproved
such
continual
seclusion
they
walked
along
the
road
through
the
valley
and
chiefly
in
silence
for
marianne
s
mind
could
not
be
controlled
and
elinor
satisfied
with
gaining
one
point
would
not
then
attempt
more
beyond
the
entrance
of
the
valley
where
the
country
though
still
rich
was
less
wild
and
more
open
a
long
stretch
of
the
road
which
they
had
travelled
on
first
coming
to
barton
lay
before
them
and
on
reaching
that
point
they
stopped
to
look
around
them
and
examine
a
prospect
which
formed
the
distance
of
their
view
from
the
cottage
from
a
spot
which
they
had
never
happened
to
reach
in
any
of
their
walks
before
amongst
the
objects
in
the
scene
they
soon
discovered
an
animated
one
it
was
a
man
on
horseback
riding
towards
them
in
a
few
minutes
they
could
distinguish
him
to
be
a
gentleman
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
marianne
rapturously
exclaimed
it
is
he
it
is
indeed
i
know
it
is
and
was
hastening
to
meet
him
when
elinor
cried
out
indeed
marianne
i
think
you
are
mistaken
it
is
not
willoughby
the
person
is
not
tall
enough
for
him
and
has
not
his
air
he
has
he
has
cried
marianne
i
am
sure
he
has
his
air
his
coat
his
horse
i
knew
how
soon
he
would
come
she
walked
eagerly
on
as
she
spoke
and
elinor
to
screen
marianne
from
particularity
as
she
felt
almost
certain
of
its
not
being
willoughby
quickened
her
pace
and
kept
up
with
her
they
were
soon
within
thirty
yards
of
the
gentleman
marianne
looked
again
her
heart
sunk
within
her
and
abruptly
turning
round
she
was
hurrying
back
when
the
voices
of
both
her
sisters
were
raised
to
detain
her
a
third
almost
as
well
known
as
willoughby
s
joined
them
in
begging
her
to
stop
and
she
turned
round
with
surprise
to
see
and
welcome
edward
ferrars
[illustration
begging
her
to
stop
]
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
at
that
moment
be
forgiven
for
not
being
willoughby
the
only
one
who
could
have
gained
a
smile
from
her
but
she
dispersed
her
tears
to
smile
on
him
and
in
her
sister
s
happiness
forgot
for
a
time
her
own
disappointment
he
dismounted
and
giving
his
horse
to
his
servant
walked
back
with
them
to
barton
whither
he
was
purposely
coming
to
visit
them
he
was
welcomed
by
them
all
with
great
cordiality
but
especially
by
marianne
who
showed
more
warmth
of
regard
in
her
reception
of
him
than
even
elinor
herself
to
marianne
indeed
the
meeting
between
edward
and
her
sister
was
but
a
continuation
of
that
unaccountable
coldness
which
she
had
often
observed
at
norland
in
their
mutual
behaviour
on
edward
s
side
more
particularly
there
was
a
deficiency
of
all
that
a
lover
ought
to
look
and
say
on
such
an
occasion
he
was
confused
seemed
scarcely
sensible
of
pleasure
in
seeing
them
looked
neither
rapturous
nor
gay
said
little
but
what
was
forced
from
him
by
questions
and
distinguished
elinor
by
no
mark
of
affection
marianne
saw
and
listened
with
increasing
surprise
she
began
almost
to
feel
a
dislike
of
edward
and
it
ended
as
every
feeling
must
end
with
her
by
carrying
back
her
thoughts
to
willoughby
whose
manners
formed
a
contrast
sufficiently
striking
to
those
of
his
brother
elect
after
a
short
silence
which
succeeded
the
first
surprise
and
enquiries
of
meeting
marianne
asked
edward
if
he
came
directly
from
london
no
he
had
been
in
devonshire
a
fortnight
a
fortnight
she
repeated
surprised
at
his
being
so
long
in
the
same
county
with
elinor
without
seeing
her
before
he
looked
rather
distressed
as
he
added
that
he
had
been
staying
with
some
friends
near
plymouth
have
you
been
lately
in
sussex
said
elinor
i
was
at
norland
about
a
month
ago
and
how
does
dear
dear
norland
look
cried
marianne
dear
dear
norland
said
elinor
probably
looks
much
as
it
always
does
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
woods
and
walks
thickly
covered
with
dead
leaves
oh
cried
marianne
with
what
transporting
sensation
have
i
formerly
seen
them
fall
how
have
i
delighted
as
i
walked
to
see
them
driven
in
showers
about
me
by
the
wind
what
feelings
have
they
the
season
the
air
altogether
inspired
now
there
is
no
one
to
regard
them
they
are
seen
only
as
a
nuisance
swept
hastily
off
and
driven
as
much
as
possible
from
the
sight
it
is
not
every
one
said
elinor
who
has
your
passion
for
dead
leaves
no
my
feelings
are
not
often
shared
not
often
understood
but
sometimes
they
are
as
she
said
this
she
sunk
into
a
reverie
for
a
few
moments
but
rousing
herself
again
now
edward
said
she
calling
his
attention
to
the
prospect
here
is
barton
valley
look
up
to
it
and
be
tranquil
if
you
can
look
at
those
hills
did
you
ever
see
their
equals
to
the
left
is
barton
park
amongst
those
woods
and
plantations
you
may
see
the
end
of
the
house
and
there
beneath
that
farthest
hill
which
rises
with
such
grandeur
is
our
cottage
it
is
a
beautiful
country
he
replied
but
these
bottoms
must
be
dirty
in
winter
how
can
you
think
of
dirt
with
such
objects
before
you
because
replied
he
smiling
among
the
rest
of
the
objects
before
me
i
see
a
very
dirty
lane
how
strange
said
marianne
to
herself
as
she
walked
on
have
you
an
agreeable
neighbourhood
here
are
the
middletons
pleasant
people
no
not
all
answered
marianne
we
could
not
be
more
unfortunately
situated
marianne
cried
her
sister
how
can
you
say
so
how
can
you
be
so
unjust
they
are
a
very
respectable
family
mr
ferrars
and
towards
us
have
behaved
in
the
friendliest
manner
have
you
forgot
marianne
how
many
pleasant
days
we
have
owed
to
them
no
said
marianne
in
a
low
voice
nor
how
many
painful
moments
elinor
took
no
notice
of
this
and
directing
her
attention
to
their
visitor
endeavoured
to
support
something
like
discourse
with
him
by
talking
of
their
present
residence
its
conveniences
c
extorting
from
him
occasional
questions
and
remarks
his
coldness
and
reserve
mortified
her
severely
she
was
vexed
and
half
angry
but
resolving
to
regulate
her
behaviour
to
him
by
the
past
rather
than
the
present
she
avoided
every
appearance
of
resentment
or
displeasure
and
treated
him
as
she
thought
he
ought
to
be
treated
from
the
family
connection
chapter
xvii
mrs
dashwood
was
surprised
only
for
a
moment
at
seeing
him
for
his
coming
to
barton
was
in
her
opinion
of
all
things
the
most
natural
her
joy
and
expression
of
regard
long
outlived
her
wonder
he
received
the
kindest
welcome
from
her
and
shyness
coldness
reserve
could
not
stand
against
such
a
reception
they
had
begun
to
fail
him
before
he
entered
the
house
and
they
were
quite
overcome
by
the
captivating
manners
of
mrs
dashwood
indeed
a
man
could
not
very
well
be
in
love
with
either
of
her
daughters
without
extending
the
passion
to
her
and
elinor
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
soon
become
more
like
himself
his
affections
seemed
to
reanimate
towards
them
all
and
his
interest
in
their
welfare
again
became
perceptible
he
was
not
in
spirits
however
he
praised
their
house
admired
its
prospect
was
attentive
and
kind
but
still
he
was
not
in
spirits
the
whole
family
perceived
it
and
mrs
dashwood
attributing
it
to
some
want
of
liberality
in
his
mother
sat
down
to
table
indignant
against
all
selfish
parents
what
are
mrs
ferrars
s
views
for
you
at
present
edward
said
she
when
dinner
was
over
and
they
had
drawn
round
the
fire
are
you
still
to
be
a
great
orator
in
spite
of
yourself
no
i
hope
my
mother
is
now
convinced
that
i
have
no
more
talents
than
inclination
for
a
public
life
but
how
is
your
fame
to
be
established
for
famous
you
must
be
to
satisfy
all
your
family
and
with
no
inclination
for
expense
no
affection
for
strangers
no
profession
and
no
assurance
you
may
find
it
a
difficult
matter
i
shall
not
attempt
it
i
have
no
wish
to
be
distinguished
and
have
every
reason
to
hope
i
never
shall
thank
heaven
i
cannot
be
forced
into
genius
and
eloquence
you
have
no
ambition
i
well
know
your
wishes
are
all
moderate
as
moderate
as
those
of
the
rest
of
the
world
i
believe
i
wish
as
well
as
every
body
else
to
be
perfectly
happy
but
like
every
body
else
it
must
be
in
my
own
way
greatness
will
not
make
me
so
strange
that
it
would
cried
marianne
what
have
wealth
or
grandeur
to
do
with
happiness
grandeur
has
but
little
said
elinor
but
wealth
has
much
to
do
with
it
elinor
for
shame
said
marianne
money
can
only
give
happiness
where
there
is
nothing
else
to
give
it
beyond
a
competence
it
can
afford
no
real
satisfaction
as
far
as
mere
self
is
concerned
perhaps
said
elinor
smiling
we
may
come
to
the
same
point
your
competence
and
my
wealth
are
very
much
alike
i
dare
say
and
without
them
as
the
world
goes
now
we
shall
both
agree
that
every
kind
of
external
comfort
must
be
wanting
your
ideas
are
only
more
noble
than
mine
come
what
is
your
competence
about
eighteen
hundred
or
two
thousand
a
year
not
more
than
that
elinor
laughed
two
thousand
a
year
one
is
my
wealth
i
guessed
how
it
would
end
and
yet
two
thousand
a
year
is
a
very
moderate
income
said
marianne
a
family
cannot
well
be
maintained
on
a
smaller
i
am
sure
i
am
not
extravagant
in
my
demands
a
proper
establishment
of
servants
a
carriage
perhaps
two
and
hunters
cannot
be
supported
on
less
elinor
smiled
again
to
hear
her
sister
describing
so
accurately
their
future
expenses
at
combe
magna
hunters
repeated
edward
but
why
must
you
have
hunters
every
body
does
not
hunt
marianne
coloured
as
she
replied
but
most
people
do
i
wish
said
margaret
striking
out
a
novel
thought
that
somebody
would
give
us
all
a
large
fortune
a
piece
oh
that
they
would
cried
marianne
her
eyes
sparkling
with
animation
and
her
cheeks
glowing
with
the
delight
of
such
imaginary
happiness
we
are
all
unanimous
in
that
wish
i
suppose
said
elinor
in
spite
of
the
insufficiency
of
wealth
oh
dear
cried
margaret
how
happy
i
should
be
i
wonder
what
i
should
do
with
it
marianne
looked
as
if
she
had
no
doubt
on
that
point
i
should
be
puzzled
to
spend
so
large
a
fortune
myself
said
mrs
dashwood
if
my
children
were
all
to
be
rich
without
my
help
you
must
begin
your
improvements
on
this
house
observed
elinor
and
your
difficulties
will
soon
vanish
what
magnificent
orders
would
travel
from
this
family
to
london
said
edward
in
such
an
event
what
a
happy
day
for
booksellers
music
sellers
and
print
shops
you
miss
dashwood
would
give
a
general
commission
for
every
new
print
of
merit
to
be
sent
you
and
as
for
marianne
i
know
her
greatness
of
soul
there
would
not
be
music
enough
in
london
to
content
her
and
books
thomson
cowper
scott
she
would
buy
them
all
over
and
over
again
she
would
buy
up
every
copy
i
believe
to
prevent
their
falling
into
unworthy
hands
and
she
would
have
every
book
that
tells
her
how
to
admire
an
old
twisted
tree
should
not
you
marianne
forgive
me
if
i
am
very
saucy
but
i
was
willing
to
show
you
that
i
had
not
forgot
our
old
disputes
i
love
to
be
reminded
of
the
past
edward
whether
it
be
melancholy
or
gay
i
love
to
recall
it
and
you
will
never
offend
me
by
talking
of
former
times
you
are
very
right
in
supposing
how
my
money
would
be
spent
some
of
it
at
least
my
loose
cash
would
certainly
be
employed
in
improving
my
collection
of
music
and
books
and
the
bulk
of
your
fortune
would
be
laid
out
in
annuities
on
the
authors
or
their
heirs
no
edward
i
should
have
something
else
to
do
with
it
perhaps
then
you
would
bestow
it
as
a
reward
on
that
person
who
wrote
the
ablest
defence
of
your
favourite
maxim
that
no
one
can
ever
be
in
love
more
than
once
in
their
life
for
your
opinion
on
that
point
is
unchanged
i
presume
undoubtedly
at
my
time
of
life
opinions
are
tolerably
fixed
it
is
not
likely
that
i
should
now
see
or
hear
any
thing
to
change
them
marianne
is
as
steadfast
as
ever
you
see
said
elinor
she
is
not
at
all
altered
she
is
only
grown
a
little
more
grave
than
she
was
nay
edward
said
marianne
you
need
not
reproach
me
you
are
not
very
gay
yourself
why
should
you
think
so
replied
he
with
a
sigh
but
gaiety
never
was
a
part
of
my
character
nor
do
i
think
it
a
part
of
marianne
s
said
elinor
i
should
hardly
call
her
a
lively
girl
she
is
very
earnest
very
eager
in
all
she
does
sometimes
talks
a
great
deal
and
always
with
animation
but
she
is
not
often
really
merry
i
believe
you
are
right
he
replied
and
yet
i
have
always
set
her
down
as
a
lively
girl
i
have
frequently
detected
myself
in
such
kind
of
mistakes
said
elinor
in
a
total
misapprehension
of
character
in
some
point
or
other
fancying
people
so
much
more
gay
or
grave
or
ingenious
or
stupid
than
they
really
are
and
i
can
hardly
tell
why
or
in
what
the
deception
originated
sometimes
one
is
guided
by
what
they
say
of
themselves
and
very
frequently
by
what
other
people
say
of
them
without
giving
oneself
time
to
deliberate
and
judge
but
i
thought
it
was
right
elinor
said
marianne
to
be
guided
wholly
by
the
opinion
of
other
people
i
thought
our
judgments
were
given
us
merely
to
be
subservient
to
those
of
neighbours
this
has
always
been
your
doctrine
i
am
sure
no
marianne
never
my
doctrine
has
never
aimed
at
the
subjection
of
the
understanding
all
i
have
ever
attempted
to
influence
has
been
the
behaviour
you
must
not
confound
my
meaning
i
am
guilty
i
confess
of
having
often
wished
you
to
treat
our
acquaintance
in
general
with
greater
attention
but
when
have
i
advised
you
to
adopt
their
sentiments
or
to
conform
to
their
judgment
in
serious
matters
you
have
not
been
able
to
bring
your
sister
over
to
your
plan
of
general
civility
said
edward
to
elinor
do
you
gain
no
ground
quite
the
contrary
replied
elinor
looking
expressively
at
marianne
my
judgment
he
returned
is
all
on
your
side
of
the
question
but
i
am
afraid
my
practice
is
much
more
on
your
sister
s
i
never
wish
to
offend
but
i
am
so
foolishly
shy
that
i
often
seem
negligent
when
i
am
only
kept
back
by
my
natural
awkwardness
i
have
frequently
thought
that
i
must
have
been
intended
by
nature
to
be
fond
of
low
company
i
am
so
little
at
my
ease
among
strangers
of
gentility
marianne
has
not
shyness
to
excuse
any
inattention
of
hers
said
elinor
she
knows
her
own
worth
too
well
for
false
shame
replied
edward
shyness
is
only
the
effect
of
a
sense
of
inferiority
in
some
way
or
other
if
i
could
persuade
myself
that
my
manners
were
perfectly
easy
and
graceful
i
should
not
be
shy
but
you
would
still
be
reserved
said
marianne
and
that
is
worse
edward
started
reserved
am
i
reserved
marianne
yes
very
i
do
not
understand
you
replied
he
colouring
reserved
how
in
what
manner
what
am
i
to
tell
you
what
can
you
suppose
elinor
looked
surprised
at
his
emotion
but
trying
to
laugh
off
the
subject
she
said
to
him
do
not
you
know
my
sister
well
enough
to
understand
what
she
means
do
not
you
know
she
calls
every
one
reserved
who
does
not
talk
as
fast
and
admire
what
she
admires
as
rapturously
as
herself
edward
made
no
answer
his
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
returned
on
him
in
their
fullest
extent
and
he
sat
for
some
time
silent
and
dull
chapter
xviii
elinor
saw
with
great
uneasiness
the
low
spirits
of
her
friend
his
visit
afforded
her
but
a
very
partial
satisfaction
while
his
own
enjoyment
in
it
appeared
so
imperfect
it
was
evident
that
he
was
unhappy
she
wished
it
were
equally
evident
that
he
still
distinguished
her
by
the
same
affection
which
once
she
had
felt
no
doubt
of
inspiring
but
hitherto
the
continuance
of
his
preference
seemed
very
uncertain
and
the
reservedness
of
his
manner
towards
her
contradicted
one
moment
what
a
more
animated
look
had
intimated
the
preceding
one
he
joined
her
and
marianne
in
the
breakfast
room
the
next
morning
before
the
others
were
down
and
marianne
who
was
always
eager
to
promote
their
happiness
as
far
as
she
could
soon
left
them
to
themselves
but
before
she
was
half
way
upstairs
she
heard
the
parlour
door
open
and
turning
round
was
astonished
to
see
edward
himself
come
out
i
am
going
into
the
village
to
see
my
horses
said
he
as
you
are
not
yet
ready
for
breakfast
i
shall
be
back
again
presently
*

edward
returned
to
them
with
fresh
admiration
of
the
surrounding
country
in
his
walk
to
the
village
he
had
seen
many
parts
of
the
valley
to
advantage
and
the
village
itself
in
a
much
higher
situation
than
the
cottage
afforded
a
general
view
of
the
whole
which
had
exceedingly
pleased
him
this
was
a
subject
which
ensured
marianne
s
attention
and
she
was
beginning
to
describe
her
own
admiration
of
these
scenes
and
to
question
him
more
minutely
on
the
objects
that
had
particularly
struck
him
when
edward
interrupted
her
by
saying
you
must
not
enquire
too
far
marianne
remember
i
have
no
knowledge
in
the
picturesque
and
i
shall
offend
you
by
my
ignorance
and
want
of
taste
if
we
come
to
particulars
i
shall
call
hills
steep
which
ought
to
be
bold
surfaces
strange
and
uncouth
which
ought
to
be
irregular
and
rugged
and
distant
objects
out
of
sight
which
ought
only
to
be
indistinct
through
the
soft
medium
of
a
hazy
atmosphere
you
must
be
satisfied
with
such
admiration
as
i
can
honestly
give
i
call
it
a
very
fine
country
the
hills
are
steep
the
woods
seem
full
of
fine
timber
and
the
valley
looks
comfortable
and
snug
with
rich
meadows
and
several
neat
farm
houses
scattered
here
and
there
it
exactly
answers
my
idea
of
a
fine
country
because
it
unites
beauty
with
utility
and
i
dare
say
it
is
a
picturesque
one
too
because
you
admire
it
i
can
easily
believe
it
to
be
full
of
rocks
and
promontories
grey
moss
and
brush
wood
but
these
are
all
lost
on
me
i
know
nothing
of
the
picturesque
i
am
afraid
it
is
but
too
true
said
marianne
but
why
should
you
boast
of
it
i
suspect
said
elinor
that
to
avoid
one
kind
of
affectation
edward
here
falls
into
another
because
he
believes
many
people
pretend
to
more
admiration
of
the
beauties
of
nature
than
they
really
feel
and
is
disgusted
with
such
pretensions
he
affects
greater
indifference
and
less
discrimination
in
viewing
them
himself
than
he
possesses
he
is
fastidious
and
will
have
an
affectation
of
his
own
it
is
very
true
said
marianne
that
admiration
of
landscape
scenery
is
become
a
mere
jargon
every
body
pretends
to
feel
and
tries
to
describe
with
the
taste
and
elegance
of
him
who
first
defined
what
picturesque
beauty
was
i
detest
jargon
of
every
kind
and
sometimes
i
have
kept
my
feelings
to
myself
because
i
could
find
no
language
to
describe
them
in
but
what
was
worn
and
hackneyed
out
of
all
sense
and
meaning
i
am
convinced
said
edward
that
you
really
feel
all
the
delight
in
a
fine
prospect
which
you
profess
to
feel
but
in
return
your
sister
must
allow
me
to
feel
no
more
than
i
profess
i
like
a
fine
prospect
but
not
on
picturesque
principles
i
do
not
like
crooked
twisted
blasted
trees
i
admire
them
much
more
if
they
are
tall
straight
and
flourishing
i
do
not
like
ruined
tattered
cottages
i
am
not
fond
of
nettles
or
thistles
or
heath
blossoms
i
have
more
pleasure
in
a
snug
farm
house
than
a
watch
tower
and
a
troop
of
tidy
happy
villages
please
me
better
than
the
finest
banditti
in
the
world
marianne
looked
with
amazement
at
edward
with
compassion
at
her
sister
elinor
only
laughed
the
subject
was
continued
no
farther
and
marianne
remained
thoughtfully
silent
till
a
new
object
suddenly
engaged
her
attention
she
was
sitting
by
edward
and
in
taking
his
tea
from
mrs
dashwood
his
hand
passed
so
directly
before
her
as
to
make
a
ring
with
a
plait
of
hair
in
the
centre
very
conspicuous
on
one
of
his
fingers
i
never
saw
you
wear
a
ring
before
edward
she
cried
is
that
fanny
s
hair
i
remember
her
promising
to
give
you
some
but
i
should
have
thought
her
hair
had
been
darker
marianne
spoke
inconsiderately
what
she
really
felt
but
when
she
saw
how
much
she
had
pained
edward
her
own
vexation
at
her
want
of
thought
could
not
be
surpassed
by
his
he
coloured
very
deeply
and
giving
a
momentary
glance
at
elinor
replied
yes
it
is
my
sister
s
hair
the
setting
always
casts
a
different
shade
on
it
you
know
elinor
had
met
his
eye
and
looked
conscious
likewise
that
the
hair
was
her
own
she
instantaneously
felt
as
well
satisfied
as
marianne
the
only
difference
in
their
conclusions
was
that
what
marianne
considered
as
a
free
gift
from
her
sister
elinor
was
conscious
must
have
been
procured
by
some
theft
or
contrivance
unknown
to
herself
she
was
not
in
a
humour
however
to
regard
it
as
an
affront
and
affecting
to
take
no
notice
of
what
passed
by
instantly
talking
of
something
else
she
internally
resolved
henceforward
to
catch
every
opportunity
of
eyeing
the
hair
and
of
satisfying
herself
beyond
all
doubt
that
it
was
exactly
the
shade
of
her
own
edward
s
embarrassment
lasted
some
time
and
it
ended
in
an
absence
of
mind
still
more
settled
he
was
particularly
grave
the
whole
morning
marianne
severely
censured
herself
for
what
she
had
said
but
her
own
forgiveness
might
have
been
more
speedy
had
she
known
how
little
offence
it
had
given
her
sister
before
the
middle
of
the
day
they
were
visited
by
sir
john
and
mrs
jennings
who
having
heard
of
the
arrival
of
a
gentleman
at
the
cottage
came
to
take
a
survey
of
the
guest
with
the
assistance
of
his
mother
in
law
sir
john
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
the
name
of
ferrars
began
with
an
f
and
this
prepared
a
future
mine
of
raillery
against
the
devoted
elinor
which
nothing
but
the
newness
of
their
acquaintance
with
edward
could
have
prevented
from
being
immediately
sprung
but
as
it
was
she
only
learned
from
some
very
significant
looks
how
far
their
penetration
founded
on
margaret
s
instructions
extended
sir
john
never
came
to
the
dashwoods
without
either
inviting
them
to
dine
at
the
park
the
next
day
or
to
drink
tea
with
them
that
evening
on
the
present
occasion
for
the
better
entertainment
of
their
visitor
towards
whose
amusement
he
felt
himself
bound
to
contribute
he
wished
to
engage
them
for
both
you
must
drink
tea
with
us
to
night
said
he
for
we
shall
be
quite
alone
and
tomorrow
you
must
absolutely
dine
with
us
for
we
shall
be
a
large
party
mrs
jennings
enforced
the
necessity
and
who
knows
but
you
may
raise
a
dance
said
she
and
that
will
tempt
you
miss
marianne
a
dance
cried
marianne
impossible
who
is
to
dance
[illustration
came
to
take
a
survey
of
the
guest
]
who
why
yourselves
and
the
careys
and
whitakers
to
be
sure
what
you
thought
nobody
could
dance
because
a
certain
person
that
shall
be
nameless
is
gone
i
wish
with
all
my
soul
cried
sir
john
that
willoughby
were
among
us
again
this
and
marianne
s
blushing
gave
new
suspicions
to
edward
and
who
is
willoughby
said
he
in
a
low
voice
to
miss
dashwood
by
whom
he
was
sitting
she
gave
him
a
brief
reply
marianne
s
countenance
was
more
communicative
edward
saw
enough
to
comprehend
not
only
the
meaning
of
others
but
such
of
marianne
s
expressions
as
had
puzzled
him
before
and
when
their
visitors
left
them
he
went
immediately
round
her
and
said
in
a
whisper
i
have
been
guessing
shall
i
tell
you
my
guess
what
do
you
mean
shall
i
tell
you
certainly
well
then
i
guess
that
mr
willoughby
hunts
marianne
was
surprised
and
confused
yet
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
quiet
archness
of
his
manner
and
after
a
moment
s
silence
said
oh
edward
how
can
you
but
the
time
will
come
i
hope
i
am
sure
you
will
like
him
i
do
not
doubt
it
replied
he
rather
astonished
at
her
earnestness
and
warmth
for
had
he
not
imagined
it
to
be
a
joke
for
the
good
of
her
acquaintance
in
general
founded
only
on
a
something
or
a
nothing
between
mr
willoughby
and
herself
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
mention
it
chapter
xix
edward
remained
a
week
at
the
cottage
he
was
earnestly
pressed
by
mrs
dashwood
to
stay
longer
but
as
if
he
were
bent
only
on
self
mortification
he
seemed
resolved
to
be
gone
when
his
enjoyment
among
his
friends
was
at
the
height
his
spirits
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
though
still
very
unequal
were
greatly
improved
he
grew
more
and
more
partial
to
the
house
and
environs
never
spoke
of
going
away
without
a
sigh
declared
his
time
to
be
wholly
disengaged
even
doubted
to
what
place
he
should
go
when
he
left
them
but
still
go
he
must
never
had
any
week
passed
so
quickly
he
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
gone
he
said
so
repeatedly
other
things
he
said
too
which
marked
the
turn
of
his
feelings
and
gave
the
lie
to
his
actions
he
had
no
pleasure
at
norland
he
detested
being
in
town
but
either
to
norland
or
london
he
must
go
he
valued
their
kindness
beyond
any
thing
and
his
greatest
happiness
was
in
being
with
them
yet
he
must
leave
them
at
the
end
of
a
week
in
spite
of
their
wishes
and
his
own
and
without
any
restraint
on
his
time
elinor
placed
all
that
was
astonishing
in
this
way
of
acting
to
his
mother
s
account
and
it
was
happy
for
her
that
he
had
a
mother
whose
character
was
so
imperfectly
known
to
her
as
to
be
the
general
excuse
for
every
thing
strange
on
the
part
of
her
son
disappointed
however
and
vexed
as
she
was
and
sometimes
displeased
with
his
uncertain
behaviour
to
herself
she
was
very
well
disposed
on
the
whole
to
regard
his
actions
with
all
the
candid
allowances
and
generous
qualifications
which
had
been
rather
more
painfully
extorted
from
her
for
willoughby
s
service
by
her
mother
his
want
of
spirits
of
openness
and
of
consistency
were
most
usually
attributed
to
his
want
of
independence
and
his
better
knowledge
of
mrs
ferrars
s
disposition
and
designs
the
shortness
of
his
visit
the
steadiness
of
his
purpose
in
leaving
them
originated
in
the
same
fettered
inclination
the
same
inevitable
necessity
of
temporizing
with
his
mother
the
old
well
established
grievance
of
duty
against
will
parent
against
child
was
the
cause
of
all
she
would
have
been
glad
to
know
when
these
difficulties
were
to
cease
this
opposition
was
to
yield
when
mrs
ferrars
would
be
reformed
and
her
son
be
at
liberty
to
be
happy
but
from
such
vain
wishes
she
was
forced
to
turn
for
comfort
to
the
renewal
of
her
confidence
in
edward
s
affection
to
the
remembrance
of
every
mark
of
regard
in
look
or
word
which
fell
from
him
while
at
barton
and
above
all
to
that
flattering
proof
of
it
which
he
constantly
wore
round
his
finger
i
think
edward
said
mrs
dashwood
as
they
were
at
breakfast
the
last
morning
you
would
be
a
happier
man
if
you
had
any
profession
to
engage
your
time
and
give
an
interest
to
your
plans
and
actions
some
inconvenience
to
your
friends
indeed
might
result
from
it
you
would
not
be
able
to
give
them
so
much
of
your
time
but
with
a
smile
you
would
be
materially
benefited
in
one
particular
at
least
you
would
know
where
to
go
when
you
left
them
i
do
assure
you
he
replied
that
i
have
long
thought
on
this
point
as
you
think
now
it
has
been
and
is
and
probably
will
always
be
a
heavy
misfortune
to
me
that
i
have
had
no
necessary
business
to
engage
me
no
profession
to
give
me
employment
or
afford
me
any
thing
like
independence
but
unfortunately
my
own
nicety
and
the
nicety
of
my
friends
have
made
me
what
i
am
an
idle
helpless
being
we
never
could
agree
in
our
choice
of
a
profession
i
always
preferred
the
church
as
i
still
do
but
that
was
not
smart
enough
for
my
family
they
recommended
the
army
that
was
a
great
deal
too
smart
for
me
the
law
was
allowed
to
be
genteel
enough
many
young
men
who
had
chambers
in
the
temple
made
a
very
good
appearance
in
the
first
circles
and
drove
about
town
in
very
knowing
gigs
but
i
had
no
inclination
for
the
law
even
in
this
less
abstruse
study
of
it
which
my
family
approved
as
for
the
navy
it
had
fashion
on
its
side
but
i
was
too
old
when
the
subject
was
first
started
to
enter
it
and
at
length
as
there
was
no
necessity
for
my
having
any
profession
at
all
as
i
might
be
as
dashing
and
expensive
without
a
red
coat
on
my
back
as
with
one
idleness
was
pronounced
on
the
whole
to
be
most
advantageous
and
honourable
and
a
young
man
of
eighteen
is
not
in
general
so
earnestly
bent
on
being
busy
as
to
resist
the
solicitations
of
his
friends
to
do
nothing
i
was
therefore
entered
at
oxford
and
have
been
properly
idle
ever
since
the
consequence
of
which
i
suppose
will
be
said
mrs
dashwood
since
leisure
has
not
promoted
your
own
happiness
that
your
sons
will
be
brought
up
to
as
many
pursuits
employments
professions
and
trades
as
columella
s
they
will
be
brought
up
said
he
in
a
serious
accent
to
be
as
unlike
myself
as
is
possible
in
feeling
in
action
in
condition
in
every
thing
come
come
this
is
all
an
effusion
of
immediate
want
of
spirits
edward
you
are
in
a
melancholy
humour
and
fancy
that
any
one
unlike
yourself
must
be
happy
but
remember
that
the
pain
of
parting
from
friends
will
be
felt
by
every
body
at
times
whatever
be
their
education
or
state
know
your
own
happiness
you
want
nothing
but
patience
or
give
it
a
more
fascinating
name
call
it
hope
your
mother
will
secure
to
you
in
time
that
independence
you
are
so
anxious
for
it
is
her
duty
and
it
will
it
must
ere
long
become
her
happiness
to
prevent
your
whole
youth
from
being
wasted
in
discontent
how
much
may
not
a
few
months
do
i
think
replied
edward
that
i
may
defy
many
months
to
produce
any
good
to
me
this
desponding
turn
of
mind
though
it
could
not
be
communicated
to
mrs
dashwood
gave
additional
pain
to
them
all
in
the
parting
which
shortly
took
place
and
left
an
uncomfortable
impression
on
elinor
s
feelings
especially
which
required
some
trouble
and
time
to
subdue
but
as
it
was
her
determination
to
subdue
it
and
to
prevent
herself
from
appearing
to
suffer
more
than
what
all
her
family
suffered
on
his
going
away
she
did
not
adopt
the
method
so
judiciously
employed
by
marianne
on
a
similar
occasion
to
augment
and
fix
her
sorrow
by
seeking
silence
solitude
and
idleness
their
means
were
as
different
as
their
objects
and
equally
suited
to
the
advancement
of
each
elinor
sat
down
to
her
drawing
table
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
house
busily
employed
herself
the
whole
day
neither
sought
nor
avoided
the
mention
of
his
name
appeared
to
interest
herself
almost
as
much
as
ever
in
the
general
concerns
of
the
family
and
if
by
this
conduct
she
did
not
lessen
her
own
grief
it
was
at
least
prevented
from
unnecessary
increase
and
her
mother
and
sisters
were
spared
much
solicitude
on
her
account
such
behaviour
as
this
so
exactly
the
reverse
of
her
own
appeared
no
more
meritorious
to
marianne
than
her
own
had
seemed
faulty
to
her
the
business
of
self
command
she
settled
very
easily
with
strong
affections
it
was
impossible
with
calm
ones
it
could
have
no
merit
that
her
sister
s
affections
were
calm
she
dared
not
deny
though
she
blushed
to
acknowledge
it
and
of
the
strength
of
her
own
she
gave
a
very
striking
proof
by
still
loving
and
respecting
that
sister
in
spite
of
this
mortifying
conviction
without
shutting
herself
up
from
her
family
or
leaving
the
house
in
determined
solitude
to
avoid
them
or
lying
awake
the
whole
night
to
indulge
meditation
elinor
found
every
day
afforded
her
leisure
enough
to
think
of
edward
and
of
edward
s
behaviour
in
every
possible
variety
which
the
different
state
of
her
spirits
at
different
times
could
produce
with
tenderness
pity
approbation
censure
and
doubt
there
were
moments
in
abundance
when
if
not
by
the
absence
of
her
mother
and
sisters
at
least
by
the
nature
of
their
employments
conversation
was
forbidden
among
them
and
every
effect
of
solitude
was
produced
her
mind
was
inevitably
at
liberty
her
thoughts
could
not
be
chained
elsewhere
and
the
past
and
the
future
on
a
subject
so
interesting
must
be
before
her
must
force
her
attention
and
engross
her
memory
her
reflection
and
her
fancy
from
a
reverie
of
this
kind
as
she
sat
at
her
drawing
table
she
was
roused
one
morning
soon
after
edward
s
leaving
them
by
the
arrival
of
company
she
happened
to
be
quite
alone
the
closing
of
the
little
gate
at
the
entrance
of
the
green
court
in
front
of
the
house
drew
her
eyes
to
the
window
and
she
saw
a
large
party
walking
up
to
the
door
amongst
them
were
sir
john
and
lady
middleton
and
mrs
jennings
but
there
were
two
others
a
gentleman
and
lady
who
were
quite
unknown
to
her
she
was
sitting
near
the
window
and
as
soon
as
sir
john
perceived
her
he
left
the
rest
of
the
party
to
the
ceremony
of
knocking
at
the
door
and
stepping
across
the
turf
obliged
her
to
open
the
casement
to
speak
to
him
though
the
space
was
so
short
between
the
door
and
the
window
as
to
make
it
hardly
possible
to
speak
at
one
without
being
heard
at
the
other
well
said
he
we
have
brought
you
some
strangers
how
do
you
like
them
hush
they
will
hear
you
never
mind
if
they
do
it
is
only
the
palmers
charlotte
is
very
pretty
i
can
tell
you
you
may
see
her
if
you
look
this
way
as
elinor
was
certain
of
seeing
her
in
a
couple
of
minutes
without
taking
that
liberty
she
begged
to
be
excused
where
is
marianne
has
she
run
away
because
we
are
come
i
see
her
instrument
is
open
she
is
walking
i
believe
they
were
now
joined
by
mrs
jennings
who
had
not
patience
enough
to
wait
till
the
door
was
opened
before
she
told
her
story
she
came
hallooing
to
the
window
how
do
you
do
my
dear
how
does
mrs
dashwood
do
and
where
are
your
sisters
what
all
alone
you
will
be
glad
of
a
little
company
to
sit
with
you
i
have
brought
my
other
son
and
daughter
to
see
you
only
think
of
their
coming
so
suddenly
i
thought
i
heard
a
carriage
last
night
while
we
were
drinking
our
tea
but
it
never
entered
my
head
that
it
could
be
them
i
thought
of
nothing
but
whether
it
might
not
be
colonel
brandon
come
back
again
so
i
said
to
sir
john
i
do
think
i
hear
a
carriage
perhaps
it
is
colonel
brandon
come
back
again
elinor
was
obliged
to
turn
from
her
in
the
middle
of
her
story
to
receive
the
rest
of
the
party
lady
middleton
introduced
the
two
strangers
mrs
dashwood
and
margaret
came
down
stairs
at
the
same
time
and
they
all
sat
down
to
look
at
one
another
while
mrs
jennings
continued
her
story
as
she
walked
through
the
passage
into
the
parlour
attended
by
sir
john
mrs
palmer
was
several
years
younger
than
lady
middleton
and
totally
unlike
her
in
every
respect
she
was
short
and
plump
had
a
very
pretty
face
and
the
finest
expression
of
good
humour
in
it
that
could
possibly
be
her
manners
were
by
no
means
so
elegant
as
her
sister
s
but
they
were
much
more
prepossessing
she
came
in
with
a
smile
smiled
all
the
time
of
her
visit
except
when
she
laughed
and
smiled
when
she
went
away
her
husband
was
a
grave
looking
young
man
of
five
or
six
and
twenty
with
an
air
of
more
fashion
and
sense
than
his
wife
but
of
less
willingness
to
please
or
be
pleased
he
entered
the
room
with
a
look
of
self
consequence
slightly
bowed
to
the
ladies
without
speaking
a
word
and
after
briefly
surveying
them
and
their
apartments
took
up
a
newspaper
from
the
table
and
continued
to
read
it
as
long
as
he
stayed
mrs
palmer
on
the
contrary
who
was
strongly
endowed
by
nature
with
a
turn
for
being
uniformly
civil
and
happy
was
hardly
seated
before
her
admiration
of
the
parlour
and
every
thing
in
it
burst
forth
well
what
a
delightful
room
this
is
i
never
saw
anything
so
charming
only
think
mamma
how
it
is
improved
since
i
was
here
last
i
always
thought
it
such
a
sweet
place
ma
am
turning
to
mrs
dashwood
but
you
have
made
it
so
charming
only
look
sister
how
delightful
every
thing
is
how
i
should
like
such
a
house
for
myself
should
not
you
mr
palmer
mr
palmer
made
her
no
answer
and
did
not
even
raise
his
eyes
from
the
newspaper
mr
palmer
does
not
hear
me
said
she
laughing
he
never
does
sometimes
it
is
so
ridiculous
this
was
quite
a
new
idea
to
mrs
dashwood
she
had
never
been
used
to
find
wit
in
the
inattention
of
any
one
and
could
not
help
looking
with
surprise
at
them
both
mrs
jennings
in
the
meantime
talked
on
as
loud
as
she
could
and
continued
her
account
of
their
surprise
the
evening
before
on
seeing
their
friends
without
ceasing
till
every
thing
was
told
mrs
palmer
laughed
heartily
at
the
recollection
of
their
astonishment
and
every
body
agreed
two
or
three
times
over
that
it
had
been
quite
an
agreeable
surprise
you
may
believe
how
glad
we
all
were
to
see
them
added
mrs
jennings
leaning
forward
towards
elinor
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
as
if
she
meant
to
be
heard
by
no
one
else
though
they
were
seated
on
different
sides
of
the
room
but
however
i
can
t
help
wishing
they
had
not
travelled
quite
so
fast
nor
made
such
a
long
journey
of
it
for
they
came
all
round
by
london
upon
account
of
some
business
for
you
know
nodding
significantly
and
pointing
to
her
daughter
it
was
wrong
in
her
situation
i
wanted
her
to
stay
at
home
and
rest
this
morning
but
she
would
come
with
us
she
longed
so
much
to
see
you
all
mrs
palmer
laughed
and
said
it
would
not
do
her
any
harm
she
expects
to
be
confined
in
february
continued
mrs
jennings
lady
middleton
could
no
longer
endure
such
a
conversation
and
therefore
exerted
herself
to
ask
mr
palmer
if
there
was
any
news
in
the
paper
no
none
at
all
he
replied
and
read
on
here
comes
marianne
cried
sir
john
now
palmer
you
shall
see
a
monstrous
pretty
girl
he
immediately
went
into
the
passage
opened
the
front
door
and
ushered
her
in
himself
mrs
jennings
asked
her
as
soon
as
she
appeared
if
she
had
not
been
to
allenham
and
mrs
palmer
laughed
so
heartily
at
the
question
as
to
show
she
understood
it
mr
palmer
looked
up
on
her
entering
the
room
stared
at
her
some
minutes
and
then
returned
to
his
newspaper
mrs
palmer
s
eye
was
now
caught
by
the
drawings
which
hung
round
the
room
she
got
up
to
examine
them
[illustration
i
declare
they
are
quite
charming
]
oh
dear
how
beautiful
these
are
well
how
delightful
do
but
look
mama
how
sweet
i
declare
they
are
quite
charming
i
could
look
at
them
for
ever
and
then
sitting
down
again
she
very
soon
forgot
that
there
were
any
such
things
in
the
room
when
lady
middleton
rose
to
go
away
mr
palmer
rose
also
laid
down
the
newspaper
stretched
himself
and
looked
at
them
all
around
my
love
have
you
been
asleep
said
his
wife
laughing
he
made
her
no
answer
and
only
observed
after
again
examining
the
room
that
it
was
very
low
pitched
and
that
the
ceiling
was
crooked
he
then
made
his
bow
and
departed
with
the
rest
sir
john
had
been
very
urgent
with
them
all
to
spend
the
next
day
at
the
park
mrs
dashwood
who
did
not
choose
to
dine
with
them
oftener
than
they
dined
at
the
cottage
absolutely
refused
on
her
own
account
her
daughters
might
do
as
they
pleased
but
they
had
no
curiosity
to
see
how
mr
and
mrs
palmer
ate
their
dinner
and
no
expectation
of
pleasure
from
them
in
any
other
way
they
attempted
therefore
likewise
to
excuse
themselves
the
weather
was
uncertain
and
not
likely
to
be
good
but
sir
john
would
not
be
satisfied
the
carriage
should
be
sent
for
them
and
they
must
come
lady
middleton
too
though
she
did
not
press
their
mother
pressed
them
mrs
jennings
and
mrs
palmer
joined
their
entreaties
all
seemed
equally
anxious
to
avoid
a
family
party
and
the
young
ladies
were
obliged
to
yield
why
should
they
ask
us
said
marianne
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
the
rent
of
this
cottage
is
said
to
be
low
but
we
have
it
on
very
hard
terms
if
we
are
to
dine
at
the
park
whenever
any
one
is
staying
either
with
them
or
with
us
they
mean
no
less
to
be
civil
and
kind
to
us
now
said
elinor
by
these
frequent
invitations
than
by
those
which
we
received
from
them
a
few
weeks
ago
the
alteration
is
not
in
them
if
their
parties
are
grown
tedious
and
dull
we
must
look
for
the
change
elsewhere
chapter
xx
as
the
miss
dashwoods
entered
the
drawing
room
of
the
park
the
next
day
at
one
door
mrs
palmer
came
running
in
at
the
other
looking
as
good
humoured
and
merry
as
before
she
took
them
all
most
affectionately
by
the
hand
and
expressed
great
delight
in
seeing
them
again
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
said
she
seating
herself
between
elinor
and
marianne
for
it
is
so
bad
a
day
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
come
which
would
be
a
shocking
thing
as
we
go
away
again
tomorrow
we
must
go
for
the
westons
come
to
us
next
week
you
know
it
was
quite
a
sudden
thing
our
coming
at
all
and
i
knew
nothing
of
it
till
the
carriage
was
coming
to
the
door
and
then
mr
palmer
asked
me
if
i
would
go
with
him
to
barton
he
is
so
droll
he
never
tells
me
any
thing
i
am
so
sorry
we
cannot
stay
longer
however
we
shall
meet
again
in
town
very
soon
i
hope
they
were
obliged
to
put
an
end
to
such
an
expectation
not
go
to
town
cried
mrs
palmer
with
a
laugh
i
shall
be
quite
disappointed
if
you
do
not
i
could
get
the
nicest
house
in
world
for
you
next
door
to
ours
in
hanover
square
you
must
come
indeed
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
chaperon
you
at
any
time
till
i
am
confined
if
mrs
dashwood
should
not
like
to
go
into
public
they
thanked
her
but
were
obliged
to
resist
all
her
entreaties
oh
my
love
cried
mrs
palmer
to
her
husband
who
just
then
entered
the
room
you
must
help
me
to
persuade
the
miss
dashwoods
to
go
to
town
this
winter
her
love
made
no
answer
and
after
slightly
bowing
to
the
ladies
began
complaining
of
the
weather
how
horrid
all
this
is
said
he
such
weather
makes
every
thing
and
every
body
disgusting
dullness
is
as
much
produced
within
doors
as
without
by
rain
it
makes
one
detest
all
one
s
acquaintance
what
the
devil
does
sir
john
mean
by
not
having
a
billiard
room
in
his
house
how
few
people
know
what
comfort
is
sir
john
is
as
stupid
as
the
weather
the
rest
of
the
company
soon
dropt
in
i
am
afraid
miss
marianne
said
sir
john
you
have
not
been
able
to
take
your
usual
walk
to
allenham
today
marianne
looked
very
grave
and
said
nothing
oh
don
t
be
so
sly
before
us
said
mrs
palmer
for
we
know
all
about
it
i
assure
you
and
i
admire
your
taste
very
much
for
i
think
he
is
extremely
handsome
we
do
not
live
a
great
way
from
him
in
the
country
you
know
not
above
ten
miles
i
dare
say
much
nearer
thirty
said
her
husband
ah
well
there
is
not
much
difference
i
never
was
at
his
house
but
they
say
it
is
a
sweet
pretty
place
as
vile
a
spot
as
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
said
mr
palmer
marianne
remained
perfectly
silent
though
her
countenance
betrayed
her
interest
in
what
was
said
is
it
very
ugly
continued
mrs
palmer
then
it
must
be
some
other
place
that
is
so
pretty
i
suppose
when
they
were
seated
in
the
dining
room
sir
john
observed
with
regret
that
they
were
only
eight
all
together
my
dear
said
he
to
his
lady
it
is
very
provoking
that
we
should
be
so
few
why
did
not
you
ask
the
gilberts
to
come
to
us
today
did
not
i
tell
you
sir
john
when
you
spoke
to
me
about
it
before
that
it
could
not
be
done
they
dined
with
us
last
you
and
i
sir
john
said
mrs
jennings
should
not
stand
upon
such
ceremony
then
you
would
be
very
ill
bred
cried
mr
palmer
my
love
you
contradict
every
body
said
his
wife
with
her
usual
laugh
do
you
know
that
you
are
quite
rude
i
did
not
know
i
contradicted
any
body
in
calling
your
mother
ill
bred
ay
you
may
abuse
me
as
you
please
said
the
good
natured
old
lady
you
have
taken
charlotte
off
my
hands
and
cannot
give
her
back
again
so
there
i
have
the
whip
hand
of
you
charlotte
laughed
heartily
to
think
that
her
husband
could
not
get
rid
of
her
and
exultingly
said
she
did
not
care
how
cross
he
was
to
her
as
they
must
live
together
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
be
more
thoroughly
good
natured
or
more
determined
to
be
happy
than
mrs
palmer
the
studied
indifference
insolence
and
discontent
of
her
husband
gave
her
no
pain
and
when
he
scolded
or
abused
her
she
was
highly
diverted
mr
palmer
is
so
droll
said
she
in
a
whisper
to
elinor
he
is
always
out
of
humour
elinor
was
not
inclined
after
a
little
observation
to
give
him
credit
for
being
so
genuinely
and
unaffectedly
ill
natured
or
ill
bred
as
he
wished
to
appear
his
temper
might
perhaps
be
a
little
soured
by
finding
like
many
others
of
his
sex
that
through
some
unaccountable
bias
in
favour
of
beauty
he
was
the
husband
of
a
very
silly
woman
but
she
knew
that
this
kind
of
blunder
was
too
common
for
any
sensible
man
to
be
lastingly
hurt
by
it
it
was
rather
a
wish
of
distinction
she
believed
which
produced
his
contemptuous
treatment
of
every
body
and
his
general
abuse
of
every
thing
before
him
it
was
the
desire
of
appearing
superior
to
other
people
the
motive
was
too
common
to
be
wondered
at
but
the
means
however
they
might
succeed
by
establishing
his
superiority
in
ill
breeding
were
not
likely
to
attach
any
one
to
him
except
his
wife
oh
my
dear
miss
dashwood
said
mrs
palmer
soon
afterwards
i
have
got
such
a
favour
to
ask
of
you
and
your
sister
will
you
come
and
spend
some
time
at
cleveland
this
christmas
now
pray
do
and
come
while
the
westons
are
with
us
you
cannot
think
how
happy
i
shall
be
it
will
be
quite
delightful
my
love
applying
to
her
husband
don
t
you
long
to
have
the
miss
dashwoods
come
to
cleveland
certainly
he
replied
with
a
sneer
i
came
into
devonshire
with
no
other
view
there
now
said
his
lady
you
see
mr
palmer
expects
you
so
you
cannot
refuse
to
come
they
both
eagerly
and
resolutely
declined
her
invitation
but
indeed
you
must
and
shall
come
i
am
sure
you
will
like
it
of
all
things
the
westons
will
be
with
us
and
it
will
be
quite
delightful
you
cannot
think
what
a
sweet
place
cleveland
is
and
we
are
so
gay
now
for
mr
palmer
is
always
going
about
the
country
canvassing
against
the
election
and
so
many
people
came
to
dine
with
us
that
i
never
saw
before
it
is
quite
charming
but
poor
fellow
it
is
very
fatiguing
to
him
for
he
is
forced
to
make
every
body
like
him
elinor
could
hardly
keep
her
countenance
as
she
assented
to
the
hardship
of
such
an
obligation
how
charming
it
will
be
said
charlotte
when
he
is
in
parliament
won
t
it
how
i
shall
laugh
it
will
be
so
ridiculous
to
see
all
his
letters
directed
to
him
with
an
m
p
but
do
you
know
he
says
he
will
never
frank
for
me
he
declares
he
won
t
don
t
you
mr
palmer
mr
palmer
took
no
notice
of
her
he
cannot
bear
writing
you
know
she
continued
he
says
it
is
quite
shocking
no
said
he
i
never
said
any
thing
so
irrational
don
t
palm
all
your
abuses
of
languages
upon
me
there
now
you
see
how
droll
he
is
this
is
always
the
way
with
him
sometimes
he
won
t
speak
to
me
for
half
a
day
together
and
then
he
comes
out
with
something
so
droll
all
about
any
thing
in
the
world
she
surprised
elinor
very
much
as
they
returned
into
the
drawing
room
by
asking
her
whether
she
did
not
like
mr
palmer
excessively
certainly
said
elinor
he
seems
very
agreeable
well
i
am
so
glad
you
do
i
thought
you
would
he
is
so
pleasant
and
mr
palmer
is
excessively
pleased
with
you
and
your
sisters
i
can
tell
you
and
you
can
t
think
how
disappointed
he
will
be
if
you
don
t
come
to
cleveland
i
can
t
imagine
why
you
should
object
to
it
elinor
was
again
obliged
to
decline
her
invitation
and
by
changing
the
subject
put
a
stop
to
her
entreaties
she
thought
it
probable
that
as
they
lived
in
the
same
county
mrs
palmer
might
be
able
to
give
some
more
particular
account
of
willoughby
s
general
character
than
could
be
gathered
from
the
middletons
partial
acquaintance
with
him
and
she
was
eager
to
gain
from
any
one
such
a
confirmation
of
his
merits
as
might
remove
the
possibility
of
fear
from
marianne
she
began
by
inquiring
if
they
saw
much
of
mr
willoughby
at
cleveland
and
whether
they
were
intimately
acquainted
with
him
oh
dear
yes
i
know
him
extremely
well
replied
mrs
palmer
not
that
i
ever
spoke
to
him
indeed
but
i
have
seen
him
for
ever
in
town
somehow
or
other
i
never
happened
to
be
staying
at
barton
while
he
was
at
allenham
mama
saw
him
here
once
before
but
i
was
with
my
uncle
at
weymouth
however
i
dare
say
we
should
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
in
somersetshire
if
it
had
not
happened
very
unluckily
that
we
should
never
have
been
in
the
country
together
he
is
very
little
at
combe
i
believe
but
if
he
were
ever
so
much
there
i
do
not
think
mr
palmer
would
visit
him
for
he
is
in
the
opposition
you
know
and
besides
it
is
such
a
way
off
i
know
why
you
inquire
about
him
very
well
your
sister
is
to
marry
him
i
am
monstrous
glad
of
it
for
then
i
shall
have
her
for
a
neighbour
you
know
upon
my
word
replied
elinor
you
know
much
more
of
the
matter
than
i
do
if
you
have
any
reason
to
expect
such
a
match
don
t
pretend
to
deny
it
because
you
know
it
is
what
every
body
talks
of
i
assure
you
i
heard
of
it
in
my
way
through
town
my
dear
mrs
palmer
upon
my
honour
i
did
i
met
colonel
brandon
monday
morning
in
bond
street
just
before
we
left
town
and
he
told
me
of
it
directly
you
surprise
me
very
much
colonel
brandon
tell
you
of
it
surely
you
must
be
mistaken
to
give
such
intelligence
to
a
person
who
could
not
be
interested
in
it
even
if
it
were
true
is
not
what
i
should
expect
colonel
brandon
to
do
but
i
do
assure
you
it
was
so
for
all
that
and
i
will
tell
you
how
it
happened
when
we
met
him
he
turned
back
and
walked
with
us
and
so
we
began
talking
of
my
brother
and
sister
and
one
thing
and
another
and
i
said
to
him
so
colonel
there
is
a
new
family
come
to
barton
cottage
i
hear
and
mama
sends
me
word
they
are
very
pretty
and
that
one
of
them
is
going
to
be
married
to
mr
willoughby
of
combe
magna
is
it
true
pray
for
of
course
you
must
know
as
you
have
been
in
devonshire
so
lately
and
what
did
the
colonel
say
oh
he
did
not
say
much
but
he
looked
as
if
he
knew
it
to
be
true
so
from
that
moment
i
set
it
down
as
certain
it
will
be
quite
delightful
i
declare
when
is
it
to
take
place
mr
brandon
was
very
well
i
hope
oh
yes
quite
well
and
so
full
of
your
praises
he
did
nothing
but
say
fine
things
of
you
i
am
flattered
by
his
commendation
he
seems
an
excellent
man
and
i
think
him
uncommonly
pleasing
so
do
i
he
is
such
a
charming
man
that
it
is
quite
a
pity
he
should
be
so
grave
and
so
dull
mamma
says
he
was
in
love
with
your
sister
too
i
assure
you
it
was
a
great
compliment
if
he
was
for
he
hardly
ever
falls
in
love
with
any
body
is
mr
willoughby
much
known
in
your
part
of
somersetshire
said
elinor
oh
yes
extremely
well
that
is
i
do
not
believe
many
people
are
acquainted
with
him
because
combe
magna
is
so
far
off
but
they
all
think
him
extremely
agreeable
i
assure
you
nobody
is
more
liked
than
mr
willoughby
wherever
he
goes
and
so
you
may
tell
your
sister
she
is
a
monstrous
lucky
girl
to
get
him
upon
my
honour
not
but
that
he
is
much
more
lucky
in
getting
her
because
she
is
so
very
handsome
and
agreeable
that
nothing
can
be
good
enough
for
her
however
i
don
t
think
her
hardly
at
all
handsomer
than
you
i
assure
you
for
i
think
you
both
excessively
pretty
and
so
does
mr
palmer
too
i
am
sure
though
we
could
not
get
him
to
own
it
last
night
mrs
palmer
s
information
respecting
willoughby
was
not
very
material
but
any
testimony
in
his
favour
however
small
was
pleasing
to
her
i
am
so
glad
we
are
got
acquainted
at
last
continued
charlotte
and
now
i
hope
we
shall
always
be
great
friends
you
can
t
think
how
much
i
longed
to
see
you
it
is
so
delightful
that
you
should
live
at
the
cottage
nothing
can
be
like
it
to
be
sure
and
i
am
so
glad
your
sister
is
going
to
be
well
married
i
hope
you
will
be
a
great
deal
at
combe
magna
it
is
a
sweet
place
by
all
accounts
you
have
been
long
acquainted
with
colonel
brandon
have
not
you
yes
a
great
while
ever
since
my
sister
married
he
was
a
particular
friend
of
sir
john
s
i
believe
she
added
in
a
low
voice
he
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
had
me
if
he
could
sir
john
and
lady
middleton
wished
it
very
much
but
mama
did
not
think
the
match
good
enough
for
me
otherwise
sir
john
would
have
mentioned
it
to
the
colonel
and
we
should
have
been
married
immediately
did
not
colonel
brandon
know
of
sir
john
s
proposal
to
your
mother
before
it
was
made
had
he
never
owned
his
affection
to
yourself
oh
no
but
if
mama
had
not
objected
to
it
i
dare
say
he
would
have
liked
it
of
all
things
he
had
not
seen
me
then
above
twice
for
it
was
before
i
left
school
however
i
am
much
happier
as
i
am
mr
palmer
is
the
kind
of
man
i
like
chapter
xxi
the
palmers
returned
to
cleveland
the
next
day
and
the
two
families
at
barton
were
again
left
to
entertain
each
other
but
this
did
not
last
long
elinor
had
hardly
got
their
last
visitors
out
of
her
head
had
hardly
done
wondering
at
charlotte
s
being
so
happy
without
a
cause
at
mr
palmer
s
acting
so
simply
with
good
abilities
and
at
the
strange
unsuitableness
which
often
existed
between
husband
and
wife
before
sir
john
s
and
mrs
jennings
s
active
zeal
in
the
cause
of
society
procured
her
some
other
new
acquaintance
to
see
and
observe
in
a
morning
s
excursion
to
exeter
they
had
met
with
two
young
ladies
whom
mrs
jennings
had
the
satisfaction
of
discovering
to
be
her
relations
and
this
was
enough
for
sir
john
to
invite
them
directly
to
the
park
as
soon
as
their
present
engagements
at
exeter
were
over
their
engagements
at
exeter
instantly
gave
way
before
such
an
invitation
and
lady
middleton
was
thrown
into
no
little
alarm
on
the
return
of
sir
john
by
hearing
that
she
was
very
soon
to
receive
a
visit
from
two
girls
whom
she
had
never
seen
in
her
life
and
of
whose
elegance
whose
tolerable
gentility
even
she
could
have
no
proof
for
the
assurances
of
her
husband
and
mother
on
that
subject
went
for
nothing
at
all
their
being
her
relations
too
made
it
so
much
the
worse
and
mrs
jennings
s
attempts
at
consolation
were
therefore
unfortunately
founded
when
she
advised
her
daughter
not
to
care
about
their
being
so
fashionable
because
they
were
all
cousins
and
must
put
up
with
one
another
as
it
was
impossible
however
now
to
prevent
their
coming
lady
middleton
resigned
herself
to
the
idea
of
it
with
all
the
philosophy
of
a
well
bred
woman
contenting
herself
with
merely
giving
her
husband
a
gentle
reprimand
on
the
subject
five
or
six
times
every
day
the
young
ladies
arrived
their
appearance
was
by
no
means
ungenteel
or
unfashionable
their
dress
was
very
smart
their
manners
very
civil
they
were
delighted
with
the
house
and
in
raptures
with
the
furniture
and
they
happened
to
be
so
doatingly
fond
of
children
that
lady
middleton
s
good
opinion
was
engaged
in
their
favour
before
they
had
been
an
hour
at
the
park
she
declared
them
to
be
very
agreeable
girls
indeed
which
for
her
ladyship
was
enthusiastic
admiration
sir
john
s
confidence
in
his
own
judgment
rose
with
this
animated
praise
and
he
set
off
directly
for
the
cottage
to
tell
the
miss
dashwoods
of
the
miss
steeles
arrival
and
to
assure
them
of
their
being
the
sweetest
girls
in
the
world
from
such
commendation
as
this
however
there
was
not
much
to
be
learned
elinor
well
knew
that
the
sweetest
girls
in
the
world
were
to
be
met
with
in
every
part
of
england
under
every
possible
variation
of
form
face
temper
and
understanding
sir
john
wanted
the
whole
family
to
walk
to
the
park
directly
and
look
at
his
guests
benevolent
philanthropic
man
it
was
painful
to
him
even
to
keep
a
third
cousin
to
himself
do
come
now
said
he
pray
come
you
must
come
i
declare
you
shall
come
you
can
t
think
how
you
will
like
them
lucy
is
monstrous
pretty
and
so
good
humoured
and
agreeable
the
children
are
all
hanging
about
her
already
as
if
she
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
they
both
long
to
see
you
of
all
things
for
they
have
heard
at
exeter
that
you
are
the
most
beautiful
creatures
in
the
world
and
i
have
told
them
it
is
all
very
true
and
a
great
deal
more
you
will
be
delighted
with
them
i
am
sure
they
have
brought
the
whole
coach
full
of
playthings
for
the
children
how
can
you
be
so
cross
as
not
to
come
why
they
are
your
cousins
you
know
after
a
fashion
you
are
my
cousins
and
they
are
my
wife
s
so
you
must
be
related
but
sir
john
could
not
prevail
he
could
only
obtain
a
promise
of
their
calling
at
the
park
within
a
day
or
two
and
then
left
them
in
amazement
at
their
indifference
to
walk
home
and
boast
anew
of
their
attractions
to
the
miss
steeles
as
he
had
been
already
boasting
of
the
miss
steeles
to
them
when
their
promised
visit
to
the
park
and
consequent
introduction
to
these
young
ladies
took
place
they
found
in
the
appearance
of
the
eldest
who
was
nearly
thirty
with
a
very
plain
and
not
a
sensible
face
nothing
to
admire
but
in
the
other
who
was
not
more
than
two
or
three
and
twenty
they
acknowledged
considerable
beauty
her
features
were
pretty
and
she
had
a
sharp
quick
eye
and
a
smartness
of
air
which
though
it
did
not
give
actual
elegance
or
grace
gave
distinction
to
her
person
their
manners
were
particularly
civil
and
elinor
soon
allowed
them
credit
for
some
kind
of
sense
when
she
saw
with
what
constant
and
judicious
attention
they
were
making
themselves
agreeable
to
lady
middleton
with
her
children
they
were
in
continual
raptures
extolling
their
beauty
courting
their
notice
and
humouring
their
whims
and
such
of
their
time
as
could
be
spared
from
the
importunate
demands
which
this
politeness
made
on
it
was
spent
in
admiration
of
whatever
her
ladyship
was
doing
if
she
happened
to
be
doing
any
thing
or
in
taking
patterns
of
some
elegant
new
dress
in
which
her
appearance
the
day
before
had
thrown
them
into
unceasing
delight
fortunately
for
those
who
pay
their
court
through
such
foibles
a
fond
mother
though
in
pursuit
of
praise
for
her
children
the
most
rapacious
of
human
beings
is
likewise
the
most
credulous
her
demands
are
exorbitant
but
she
will
swallow
any
thing
and
the
excessive
affection
and
endurance
of
the
miss
steeles
towards
her
offspring
were
viewed
therefore
by
lady
middleton
without
the
smallest
surprise
or
distrust
she
saw
with
maternal
complacency
all
the
impertinent
encroachments
and
mischievous
tricks
to
which
her
cousins
submitted
she
saw
their
sashes
untied
their
hair
pulled
about
their
ears
their
work
bags
searched
and
their
knives
and
scissors
stolen
away
and
felt
no
doubt
of
its
being
a
reciprocal
enjoyment
it
suggested
no
other
surprise
than
that
elinor
and
marianne
should
sit
so
composedly
by
without
claiming
a
share
in
what
was
passing
john
is
in
such
spirits
today
said
she
on
his
taking
miss
steele
s
pocket
handkerchief
and
throwing
it
out
of
window
he
is
full
of
monkey
tricks
and
soon
afterwards
on
the
second
boy
s
violently
pinching
one
of
the
same
lady
s
fingers
she
fondly
observed
how
playful
william
is
[illustration
mischievous
tricks
]
and
here
is
my
sweet
little
annamaria
she
added
tenderly
caressing
a
little
girl
of
three
years
old
who
had
not
made
a
noise
for
the
last
two
minutes
and
she
is
always
so
gentle
and
quiet
never
was
there
such
a
quiet
little
thing
but
unfortunately
in
bestowing
these
embraces
a
pin
in
her
ladyship
s
head
dress
slightly
scratching
the
child
s
neck
produced
from
this
pattern
of
gentleness
such
violent
screams
as
could
hardly
be
outdone
by
any
creature
professedly
noisy
the
mother
s
consternation
was
excessive
but
it
could
not
surpass
the
alarm
of
the
miss
steeles
and
every
thing
was
done
by
all
three
in
so
critical
an
emergency
which
affection
could
suggest
as
likely
to
assuage
the
agonies
of
the
little
sufferer
she
was
seated
in
her
mother
s
lap
covered
with
kisses
her
wound
bathed
with
lavender
water
by
one
of
the
miss
steeles
who
was
on
her
knees
to
attend
her
and
her
mouth
stuffed
with
sugar
plums
by
the
other
with
such
a
reward
for
her
tears
the
child
was
too
wise
to
cease
crying
she
still
screamed
and
sobbed
lustily
kicked
her
two
brothers
for
offering
to
touch
her
and
all
their
united
soothings
were
ineffectual
till
lady
middleton
luckily
remembering
that
in
a
scene
of
similar
distress
last
week
some
apricot
marmalade
had
been
successfully
applied
for
a
bruised
temple
the
same
remedy
was
eagerly
proposed
for
this
unfortunate
scratch
and
a
slight
intermission
of
screams
in
the
young
lady
on
hearing
it
gave
them
reason
to
hope
that
it
would
not
be
rejected
she
was
carried
out
of
the
room
therefore
in
her
mother
s
arms
in
quest
of
this
medicine
and
as
the
two
boys
chose
to
follow
though
earnestly
entreated
by
their
mother
to
stay
behind
the
four
young
ladies
were
left
in
a
quietness
which
the
room
had
not
known
for
many
hours
poor
little
creatures
said
miss
steele
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
it
might
have
been
a
very
sad
accident
yet
i
hardly
know
how
cried
marianne
unless
it
had
been
under
totally
different
circumstances
but
this
is
the
usual
way
of
heightening
alarm
where
there
is
nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
in
reality
