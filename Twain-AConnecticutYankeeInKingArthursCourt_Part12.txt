preface
the
ungentle
laws
and
customs
touched
upon
in
this
tale
are
historical
and
the
episodes
which
are
used
to
illustrate
them
are
also
historical
it
is
not
pretended
that
these
laws
and
customs
existed
in
england
in
the
sixth
century
no
it
is
only
pretended
that
inasmuch
as
they
existed
in
the
english
and
other
civilizations
of
far
later
times
it
is
safe
to
consider
that
it
is
no
libel
upon
the
sixth
century
to
suppose
them
to
have
been
in
practice
in
that
day
also
one
is
quite
justified
in
inferring
that
whatever
one
of
these
laws
or
customs
was
lacking
in
that
remote
time
its
place
was
competently
filled
by
a
worse
one
the
question
as
to
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
divine
right
of
kings
is
not
settled
in
this
book
it
was
found
too
difficult
that
the
executive
head
of
a
nation
should
be
a
person
of
lofty
character
and
extraordinary
ability
was
manifest
and
indisputable
that
none
but
the
deity
could
select
that
head
unerringly
was
also
manifest
and
indisputable
that
the
deity
ought
to
make
that
selection
then
was
likewise
manifest
and
indisputable
consequently
that
he
does
make
it
as
claimed
was
an
unavoidable
deduction
i
mean
until
the
author
of
this
book
encountered
the
pompadour
and
lady
castlemaine
and
some
other
executive
heads
of
that
kind
these
were
found
so
difficult
to
work
into
the
scheme
that
it
was
judged
better
to
take
the
other
tack
in
this
book
which
must
be
issued
this
fall
and
then
go
into
training
and
settle
the
question
in
another
book
it
is
of
course
a
thing
which
ought
to
be
settled
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
anything
particular
to
do
next
winter
anyway

a
connecticut
yankee
in
king
arthur
s
court
a
word
of
explanation
it
was
in
warwick
castle
that
i
came
across
the
curious
stranger
whom
i
am
going
to
talk
about
he
attracted
me
by
three
things
his
candid
simplicity
his
marvelous
familiarity
with
ancient
armor
and
the
restfulness
of
his
company
for
he
did
all
the
talking
we
fell
together
as
modest
people
will
in
the
tail
of
the
herd
that
was
being
shown
through
and
he
at
once
began
to
say
things
which
interested
me
as
he
talked
along
softly
pleasantly
flowingly
he
seemed
to
drift
away
imperceptibly
out
of
this
world
and
time
and
into
some
remote
era
and
old
forgotten
country
and
so
he
gradually
wove
such
a
spell
about
me
that
i
seemed
to
move
among
the
specters
and
shadows
and
dust
and
mold
of
a
gray
antiquity
holding
speech
with
a
relic
of
it
exactly
as
i
would
speak
of
my
nearest
personal
friends
or
enemies
or
my
most
familiar
neighbors
he
spoke
of
sir
bedivere
sir
bors
de
ganis
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
sir
galahad
and
all
the
other
great
names
of
the
table
round
and
how
old
old
unspeakably
old
and
faded
and
dry
and
musty
and
ancient
he
came
to
look
as
he
went
on
presently
he
turned
to
me
and
said
just
as
one
might
speak
of
the
weather
or
any
other
common
matter
you
know
about
transmigration
of
souls
do
you
know
about
transposition
of
epochs
and
bodies
i
said
i
had
not
heard
of
it
he
was
so
little
interested
just
as
when
people
speak
of
the
weather
that
he
did
not
notice
whether
i
made
him
any
answer
or
not
there
was
half
a
moment
of
silence
immediately
interrupted
by
the
droning
voice
of
the
salaried
cicerone
ancient
hauberk
date
of
the
sixth
century
time
of
king
arthur
and
the
round
table
said
to
have
belonged
to
the
knight
sir
sagramor
le
desirous
observe
the
round
hole
through
the
chain
mail
in
the
left
breast
can
t
be
accounted
for
supposed
to
have
been
done
with
a
bullet
since
invention
of
firearms
perhaps
maliciously
by
cromwell
s
soldiers
my
acquaintance
smiled
not
a
modern
smile
but
one
that
must
have
gone
out
of
general
use
many
many
centuries
ago
and
muttered
apparently
to
himself
wit
ye
well
i
saw
it
done
then
after
a
pause
added
i
did
it
myself
by
the
time
i
had
recovered
from
the
electric
surprise
of
this
remark
he
was
gone
all
that
evening
i
sat
by
my
fire
at
the
warwick
arms
steeped
in
a
dream
of
the
olden
time
while
the
rain
beat
upon
the
windows
and
the
wind
roared
about
the
eaves
and
corners
from
time
to
time
i
dipped
into
old
sir
thomas
malory
s
enchanting
book
and
fed
at
its
rich
feast
of
prodigies
and
adventures
breathed
in
the
fragrance
of
its
obsolete
names
and
dreamed
again
midnight
being
come
at
length
i
read
another
tale
for
a
nightcap
this
which
here
follows
to
wit
how
sir
launcelot
slew
two
giants
and
made
a
castle
free
anon
withal
came
there
upon
him
two
great
giants
well
armed
all
save
the
heads
with
two
horrible
clubs
in
their
hands
sir
launcelot
put
his
shield
afore
him
and
put
the
stroke
away
of
the
one
giant
and
with
his
sword
he
clave
his
head
asunder
when
his
fellow
saw
that
he
ran
away
as
he
were
wood
[*demented]
for
fear
of
the
horrible
strokes
and
sir
launcelot
after
him
with
all
his
might
and
smote
him
on
the
shoulder
and
clave
him
to
the
middle
then
sir
launcelot
went
into
the
hall
and
there
came
afore
him
three
score
ladies
and
damsels
and
all
kneeled
unto
him
and
thanked
god
and
him
of
their
deliverance
for
sir
said
they
the
most
part
of
us
have
been
here
this
seven
year
their
prisoners
and
we
have
worked
all
manner
of
silk
works
for
our
meat
and
we
are
all
great
gentle
women
born
and
blessed
be
the
time
knight
that
ever
thou
wert
born
for
thou
hast
done
the
most
worship
that
ever
did
knight
in
the
world
that
will
we
bear
record
and
we
all
pray
you
to
tell
us
your
name
that
we
may
tell
our
friends
who
delivered
us
out
of
prison
fair
damsels
he
said
my
name
is
sir
launcelot
du
lake
and
so
he
departed
from
them
and
betaught
them
unto
god
and
then
he
mounted
upon
his
horse
and
rode
into
many
strange
and
wild
countries
and
through
many
waters
and
valleys
and
evil
was
he
lodged
and
at
the
last
by
fortune
him
happened
against
a
night
to
come
to
a
fair
courtilage
and
therein
he
found
an
old
gentle
woman
that
lodged
him
with
a
good
will
and
there
he
had
good
cheer
for
him
and
his
horse
and
when
time
was
his
host
brought
him
into
a
fair
garret
over
the
gate
to
his
bed
there
sir
launcelot
unarmed
him
and
set
his
harness
by
him
and
went
to
bed
and
anon
he
fell
on
sleep
so
soon
after
there
came
one
on
horseback
and
knocked
at
the
gate
in
great
haste
and
when
sir
launcelot
heard
this
he
rose
up
and
looked
out
at
the
window
and
saw
by
the
moonlight
three
knights
come
riding
after
that
one
man
and
all
three
lashed
on
him
at
once
with
swords
and
that
one
knight
turned
on
them
knightly
again
and
defended
him
truly
said
sir
launcelot
yonder
one
knight
shall
i
help
for
it
were
shame
for
me
to
see
three
knights
on
one
and
if
he
be
slain
i
am
partner
of
his
death
and
therewith
he
took
his
harness
and
went
out
at
a
window
by
a
sheet
down
to
the
four
knights
and
then
sir
launcelot
said
on
high
turn
you
knights
unto
me
and
leave
your
fighting
with
that
knight
and
then
they
all
three
left
sir
kay
and
turned
unto
sir
launcelot
and
there
began
great
battle
for
they
alight
all
three
and
strake
many
strokes
at
sir
launcelot
and
assailed
him
on
every
side
then
sir
kay
dressed
him
for
to
have
holpen
sir
launcelot
nay
sir
said
he
i
will
none
of
your
help
therefore
as
ye
will
have
my
help
let
me
alone
with
them
sir
kay
for
the
pleasure
of
the
knight
suffered
him
for
to
do
his
will
and
so
stood
aside
and
then
anon
within
six
strokes
sir
launcelot
had
stricken
them
to
the
earth
and
then
they
all
three
cried
sir
knight
we
yield
us
unto
you
as
man
of
might
matchless
as
to
that
said
sir
launcelot
i
will
not
take
your
yielding
unto
me
but
so
that
ye
yield
you
unto
sir
kay
the
seneschal
on
that
covenant
i
will
save
your
lives
and
else
not
fair
knight
said
they
that
were
we
loath
to
do
for
as
for
sir
kay
we
chased
him
hither
and
had
overcome
him
had
ye
not
been
therefore
to
yield
us
unto
him
it
were
no
reason
well
as
to
that
said
sir
launcelot
advise
you
well
for
ye
may
choose
whether
ye
will
die
or
live
for
an
ye
be
yielden
it
shall
be
unto
sir
kay
fair
knight
then
they
said
in
saving
our
lives
we
will
do
as
thou
commandest
us
then
shall
ye
said
sir
launcelot
on
whitsunday
next
coming
go
unto
the
court
of
king
arthur
and
there
shall
ye
yield
you
unto
queen
guenever
and
put
you
all
three
in
her
grace
and
mercy
and
say
that
sir
kay
sent
you
thither
to
be
her
prisoners
on
the
morn
sir
launcelot
arose
early
and
left
sir
kay
sleeping
and
sir
launcelot
took
sir
kay
s
armor
and
his
shield
and
armed
him
and
so
he
went
to
the
stable
and
took
his
horse
and
took
his
leave
of
his
host
and
so
he
departed
then
soon
after
arose
sir
kay
and
missed
sir
launcelot
and
then
he
espied
that
he
had
his
armor
and
his
horse
now
by
my
faith
i
know
well
that
he
will
grieve
some
of
the
court
of
king
arthur
for
on
him
knights
will
be
bold
and
deem
that
it
is
i
and
that
will
beguile
them
and
because
of
his
armor
and
shield
i
am
sure
i
shall
ride
in
peace
and
then
soon
after
departed
sir
kay
and
thanked
his
host
as
i
laid
the
book
down
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
my
stranger
came
in
i
gave
him
a
pipe
and
a
chair
and
made
him
welcome
i
also
comforted
him
with
a
hot
scotch
whisky
gave
him
another
one
then
still
another
hoping
always
for
his
story
after
a
fourth
persuader
he
drifted
into
it
himself
in
a
quite
simple
and
natural
way
the
stranger
s
history
i
am
an
american
i
was
born
and
reared
in
hartford
in
the
state
of
connecticut
anyway
just
over
the
river
in
the
country
so
i
am
a
yankee
of
the
yankees
and
practical
yes
and
nearly
barren
of
sentiment
i
suppose
or
poetry
in
other
words
my
father
was
a
blacksmith
my
uncle
was
a
horse
doctor
and
i
was
both
along
at
first
then
i
went
over
to
the
great
arms
factory
and
learned
my
real
trade
learned
all
there
was
to
it
learned
to
make
everything
guns
revolvers
cannon
boilers
engines
all
sorts
of
labor
saving
machinery
why
i
could
make
anything
a
body
wanted
anything
in
the
world
it
didn
t
make
any
difference
what
and
if
there
wasn
t
any
quick
new
fangled
way
to
make
a
thing
i
could
invent
one
and
do
it
as
easy
as
rolling
off
a
log
i
became
head
superintendent
had
a
couple
of
thousand
men
under
me
well
a
man
like
that
is
a
man
that
is
full
of
fight
that
goes
without
saying
with
a
couple
of
thousand
rough
men
under
one
one
has
plenty
of
that
sort
of
amusement
i
had
anyway
at
last
i
met
my
match
and
i
got
my
dose
it
was
during
a
misunderstanding
conducted
with
crowbars
with
a
fellow
we
used
to
call
hercules
he
laid
me
out
with
a
crusher
alongside
the
head
that
made
everything
crack
and
seemed
to
spring
every
joint
in
my
skull
and
made
it
overlap
its
neighbor
then
the
world
went
out
in
darkness
and
i
didn
t
feel
anything
more
and
didn
t
know
anything
at
all
at
least
for
a
while
when
i
came
to
again
i
was
sitting
under
an
oak
tree
on
the
grass
with
a
whole
beautiful
and
broad
country
landscape
all
to
myself
nearly
not
entirely
for
there
was
a
fellow
on
a
horse
looking
down
at
me
a
fellow
fresh
out
of
a
picture
book
he
was
in
old
time
iron
armor
from
head
to
heel
with
a
helmet
on
his
head
the
shape
of
a
nail
keg
with
slits
in
it
and
he
had
a
shield
and
a
sword
and
a
prodigious
spear
and
his
horse
had
armor
on
too
and
a
steel
horn
projecting
from
his
forehead
and
gorgeous
red
and
green
silk
trappings
that
hung
down
all
around
him
like
a
bedquilt
nearly
to
the
ground
fair
sir
will
ye
just
said
this
fellow
will
i
which
will
ye
try
a
passage
of
arms
for
land
or
lady
or
for
what
are
you
giving
me
i
said
get
along
back
to
your
circus
or
i
ll
report
you
now
what
does
this
man
do
but
fall
back
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
and
then
come
rushing
at
me
as
hard
as
he
could
tear
with
his
nail
keg
bent
down
nearly
to
his
horse
s
neck
and
his
long
spear
pointed
straight
ahead
i
saw
he
meant
business
so
i
was
up
the
tree
when
he
arrived
he
allowed
that
i
was
his
property
the
captive
of
his
spear
there
was
argument
on
his
side
and
the
bulk
of
the
advantage
so
i
judged
it
best
to
humor
him
we
fixed
up
an
agreement
whereby
i
was
to
go
with
him
and
he
was
not
to
hurt
me
i
came
down
and
we
started
away
i
walking
by
the
side
of
his
horse
we
marched
comfortably
along
through
glades
and
over
brooks
which
i
could
not
remember
to
have
seen
before
which
puzzled
me
and
made
me
wonder
and
yet
we
did
not
come
to
any
circus
or
sign
of
a
circus
so
i
gave
up
the
idea
of
a
circus
and
concluded
he
was
from
an
asylum
but
we
never
came
to
an
asylum
so
i
was
up
a
stump
as
you
may
say
i
asked
him
how
far
we
were
from
hartford
he
said
he
had
never
heard
of
the
place
which
i
took
to
be
a
lie
but
allowed
it
to
go
at
that
at
the
end
of
an
hour
we
saw
a
far
away
town
sleeping
in
a
valley
by
a
winding
river
and
beyond
it
on
a
hill
a
vast
gray
fortress
with
towers
and
turrets
the
first
i
had
ever
seen
out
of
a
picture
bridgeport
said
i
pointing
camelot
said
he
my
stranger
had
been
showing
signs
of
sleepiness
he
caught
himself
nodding
now
and
smiled
one
of
those
pathetic
obsolete
smiles
of
his
and
said
i
find
i
can
t
go
on
but
come
with
me
i
ve
got
it
all
written
out
and
you
can
read
it
if
you
like
in
his
chamber
he
said
first
i
kept
a
journal
then
by
and
by
after
years
i
took
the
journal
and
turned
it
into
a
book
how
long
ago
that
was
he
handed
me
his
manuscript
and
pointed
out
the
place
where
i
should
begin
begin
here
i
ve
already
told
you
what
goes
before
he
was
steeped
in
drowsiness
by
this
time
as
i
went
out
at
his
door
i
heard
him
murmur
sleepily
give
you
good
den
fair
sir
i
sat
down
by
my
fire
and
examined
my
treasure
the
first
part
of
it
the
great
bulk
of
it
was
parchment
and
yellow
with
age
i
scanned
a
leaf
particularly
and
saw
that
it
was
a
palimpsest
under
the
old
dim
writing
of
the
yankee
historian
appeared
traces
of
a
penmanship
which
was
older
and
dimmer
still
latin
words
and
sentences
fragments
from
old
monkish
legends
evidently
i
turned
to
the
place
indicated
by
my
stranger
and
began
to
read
as
follows
the
tale
of
the
lost
land
chapter
i
camelot
camelot
camelot
said
i
to
myself
i
don
t
seem
to
remember
hearing
of
it
before
name
of
the
asylum
likely
it
was
a
soft
reposeful
summer
landscape
as
lovely
as
a
dream
and
as
lonesome
as
sunday
the
air
was
full
of
the
smell
of
flowers
and
the
buzzing
of
insects
and
the
twittering
of
birds
and
there
were
no
people
no
wagons
there
was
no
stir
of
life
nothing
going
on
the
road
was
mainly
a
winding
path
with
hoof
prints
in
it
and
now
and
then
a
faint
trace
of
wheels
on
either
side
in
the
grass
wheels
that
apparently
had
a
tire
as
broad
as
one
s
hand
presently
a
fair
slip
of
a
girl
about
ten
years
old
with
a
cataract
of
golden
hair
streaming
down
over
her
shoulders
came
along
around
her
head
she
wore
a
hoop
of
flame
red
poppies
it
was
as
sweet
an
outfit
as
ever
i
saw
what
there
was
of
it
she
walked
indolently
along
with
a
mind
at
rest
its
peace
reflected
in
her
innocent
face
the
circus
man
paid
no
attention
to
her
didn
t
even
seem
to
see
her
and
she
she
was
no
more
startled
at
his
fantastic
make
up
than
if
she
was
used
to
his
like
every
day
of
her
life
she
was
going
by
as
indifferently
as
she
might
have
gone
by
a
couple
of
cows
but
when
she
happened
to
notice
me
then
there
was
a
change
up
went
her
hands
and
she
was
turned
to
stone
her
mouth
dropped
open
her
eyes
stared
wide
and
timorously
she
was
the
picture
of
astonished
curiosity
touched
with
fear
and
there
she
stood
gazing
in
a
sort
of
stupefied
fascination
till
we
turned
a
corner
of
the
wood
and
were
lost
to
her
view
that
she
should
be
startled
at
me
instead
of
at
the
other
man
was
too
many
for
me
i
couldn
t
make
head
or
tail
of
it
and
that
she
should
seem
to
consider
me
a
spectacle
and
totally
overlook
her
own
merits
in
that
respect
was
another
puzzling
thing
and
a
display
of
magnanimity
too
that
was
surprising
in
one
so
young
there
was
food
for
thought
here
i
moved
along
as
one
in
a
dream
as
we
approached
the
town
signs
of
life
began
to
appear
at
intervals
we
passed
a
wretched
cabin
with
a
thatched
roof
and
about
it
small
fields
and
garden
patches
in
an
indifferent
state
of
cultivation
there
were
people
too
brawny
men
with
long
coarse
uncombed
hair
that
hung
down
over
their
faces
and
made
them
look
like
animals
they
and
the
women
as
a
rule
wore
a
coarse
tow
linen
robe
that
came
well
below
the
knee
and
a
rude
sort
of
sandal
and
many
wore
an
iron
collar
the
small
boys
and
girls
were
always
naked
but
nobody
seemed
to
know
it
all
of
these
people
stared
at
me
talked
about
me
ran
into
the
huts
and
fetched
out
their
families
to
gape
at
me
but
nobody
ever
noticed
that
other
fellow
except
to
make
him
humble
salutation
and
get
no
response
for
their
pains
in
the
town
were
some
substantial
windowless
houses
of
stone
scattered
among
a
wilderness
of
thatched
cabins
the
streets
were
mere
crooked
alleys
and
unpaved
troops
of
dogs
and
nude
children
played
in
the
sun
and
made
life
and
noise
hogs
roamed
and
rooted
contentedly
about
and
one
of
them
lay
in
a
reeking
wallow
in
the
middle
of
the
main
thoroughfare
and
suckled
her
family
presently
there
was
a
distant
blare
of
military
music
it
came
nearer
still
nearer
and
soon
a
noble
cavalcade
wound
into
view
glorious
with
plumed
helmets
and
flashing
mail
and
flaunting
banners
and
rich
doublets
and
horse
cloths
and
gilded
spearheads
and
through
the
muck
and
swine
and
naked
brats
and
joyous
dogs
and
shabby
huts
it
took
its
gallant
way
and
in
its
wake
we
followed
followed
through
one
winding
alley
and
then
another
and
climbing
always
climbing
till
at
last
we
gained
the
breezy
height
where
the
huge
castle
stood
there
was
an
exchange
of
bugle
blasts
then
a
parley
from
the
walls
where
men
at
arms
in
hauberk
and
morion
marched
back
and
forth
with
halberd
at
shoulder
under
flapping
banners
with
the
rude
figure
of
a
dragon
displayed
upon
them
and
then
the
great
gates
were
flung
open
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
and
the
head
of
the
cavalcade
swept
forward
under
the
frowning
arches
and
we
following
soon
found
ourselves
in
a
great
paved
court
with
towers
and
turrets
stretching
up
into
the
blue
air
on
all
the
four
sides
and
all
about
us
the
dismount
was
going
on
and
much
greeting
and
ceremony
and
running
to
and
fro
and
a
gay
display
of
moving
and
intermingling
colors
and
an
altogether
pleasant
stir
and
noise
and
confusion
chapter
ii
king
arthur
s
court
the
moment
i
got
a
chance
i
slipped
aside
privately
and
touched
an
ancient
common
looking
man
on
the
shoulder
and
said
in
an
insinuating
confidential
way
friend
do
me
a
kindness
do
you
belong
to
the
asylum
or
are
you
just
on
a
visit
or
something
like
that
he
looked
me
over
stupidly
and
said
marry
fair
sir
me
seemeth
that
will
do
i
said
i
reckon
you
are
a
patient
i
moved
away
cogitating
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
an
eye
out
for
any
chance
passenger
in
his
right
mind
that
might
come
along
and
give
me
some
light
i
judged
i
had
found
one
presently
so
i
drew
him
aside
and
said
in
his
ear
if
i
could
see
the
head
keeper
a
minute
only
just
a
minute
prithee
do
not
let
me
let
you
what
hinder
me
then
if
the
word
please
thee
better
then
he
went
on
to
say
he
was
an
under
cook
and
could
not
stop
to
gossip
though
he
would
like
it
another
time
for
it
would
comfort
his
very
liver
to
know
where
i
got
my
clothes
as
he
started
away
he
pointed
and
said
yonder
was
one
who
was
idle
enough
for
my
purpose
and
was
seeking
me
besides
no
doubt
this
was
an
airy
slim
boy
in
shrimp
colored
tights
that
made
him
look
like
a
forked
carrot
the
rest
of
his
gear
was
blue
silk
and
dainty
laces
and
ruffles
and
he
had
long
yellow
curls
and
wore
a
plumed
pink
satin
cap
tilted
complacently
over
his
ear
by
his
look
he
was
good
natured
by
his
gait
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
he
was
pretty
enough
to
frame
he
arrived
looked
me
over
with
a
smiling
and
impudent
curiosity
said
he
had
come
for
me
and
informed
me
that
he
was
a
page
go
long
i
said
you
ain
t
more
than
a
paragraph
it
was
pretty
severe
but
i
was
nettled
however
it
never
phazed
him
he
didn
t
appear
to
know
he
was
hurt
he
began
to
talk
and
laugh
in
happy
thoughtless
boyish
fashion
as
we
walked
along
and
made
himself
old
friends
with
me
at
once
asked
me
all
sorts
of
questions
about
myself
and
about
my
clothes
but
never
waited
for
an
answer
always
chattered
straight
ahead
as
if
he
didn
t
know
he
had
asked
a
question
and
wasn
t
expecting
any
reply
until
at
last
he
happened
to
mention
that
he
was
born
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
513
it
made
the
cold
chills
creep
over
me
i
stopped
and
said
a
little
faintly
maybe
i
didn
t
hear
you
just
right
say
it
again
and
say
it
slow
what
year
was
it
513
513
you
don
t
look
it
come
my
boy
i
am
a
stranger
and
friendless
be
honest
and
honorable
with
me
are
you
in
your
right
mind
he
said
he
was
are
these
other
people
in
their
right
minds
he
said
they
were
and
this
isn
t
an
asylum
i
mean
it
isn
t
a
place
where
they
cure
crazy
people
he
said
it
wasn
t
well
then
i
said
either
i
am
a
lunatic
or
something
just
as
awful
has
happened
now
tell
me
honest
and
true
where
am
i
in
king
arthur
s
court
i
waited
a
minute
to
let
that
idea
shudder
its
way
home
and
then
said
and
according
to
your
notions
what
year
is
it
now
528
nineteenth
of
june
i
felt
a
mournful
sinking
at
the
heart
and
muttered
i
shall
never
see
my
friends
again
never
never
again
they
will
not
be
born
for
more
than
thirteen
hundred
years
yet
i
seemed
to
believe
the
boy
i
didn
t
know
why
something
in
me
seemed
to
believe
him
my
consciousness
as
you
may
say
but
my
reason
didn
t
my
reason
straightway
began
to
clamor
that
was
natural
i
didn
t
know
how
to
go
about
satisfying
it
because
i
knew
that
the
testimony
of
men
wouldn
t
serve
my
reason
would
say
they
were
lunatics
and
throw
out
their
evidence
but
all
of
a
sudden
i
stumbled
on
the
very
thing
just
by
luck
i
knew
that
the
only
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
in
the
first
half
of
the
sixth
century
occurred
on
the
21st
of
june
a
d
528
o
s
and
began
at
3
minutes
after
12
noon
i
also
knew
that
no
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
was
due
in
what
to
me
was
the
present
year
i
e
1879
so
if
i
could
keep
my
anxiety
and
curiosity
from
eating
the
heart
out
of
me
for
forty
eight
hours
i
should
then
find
out
for
certain
whether
this
boy
was
telling
me
the
truth
or
not
wherefore
being
a
practical
connecticut
man
i
now
shoved
this
whole
problem
clear
out
of
my
mind
till
its
appointed
day
and
hour
should
come
in
order
that
i
might
turn
all
my
attention
to
the
circumstances
of
the
present
moment
and
be
alert
and
ready
to
make
the
most
out
of
them
that
could
be
made
one
thing
at
a
time
is
my
motto
and
just
play
that
thing
for
all
it
is
worth
even
if
it
s
only
two
pair
and
a
jack
i
made
up
my
mind
to
two
things
if
it
was
still
the
nineteenth
century
and
i
was
among
lunatics
and
couldn
t
get
away
i
would
presently
boss
that
asylum
or
know
the
reason
why
and
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
really
the
sixth
century
all
right
i
didn
t
want
any
softer
thing
i
would
boss
the
whole
country
inside
of
three
months
for
i
judged
i
would
have
the
start
of
the
best
educated
man
in
the
kingdom
by
a
matter
of
thirteen
hundred
years
and
upward
i
m
not
a
man
to
waste
time
after
my
mind
s
made
up
and
there
s
work
on
hand
so
i
said
to
the
page
now
clarence
my
boy
if
that
might
happen
to
be
your
name
i
ll
get
you
to
post
me
up
a
little
if
you
don
t
mind
what
is
the
name
of
that
apparition
that
brought
me
here
my
master
and
thine
that
is
the
good
knight
and
great
lord
sir
kay
the
seneschal
foster
brother
to
our
liege
the
king
very
good
go
on
tell
me
everything
he
made
a
long
story
of
it
but
the
part
that
had
immediate
interest
for
me
was
this
he
said
i
was
sir
kay
s
prisoner
and
that
in
the
due
course
of
custom
i
would
be
flung
into
a
dungeon
and
left
there
on
scant
commons
until
my
friends
ransomed
me
unless
i
chanced
to
rot
first
i
saw
that
the
last
chance
had
the
best
show
but
i
didn
t
waste
any
bother
about
that
time
was
too
precious
the
page
said
further
that
dinner
was
about
ended
in
the
great
hall
by
this
time
and
that
as
soon
as
the
sociability
and
the
heavy
drinking
should
begin
sir
kay
would
have
me
in
and
exhibit
me
before
king
arthur
and
his
illustrious
knights
seated
at
the
table
round
and
would
brag
about
his
exploit
in
capturing
me
and
would
probably
exaggerate
the
facts
a
little
but
it
wouldn
t
be
good
form
for
me
to
correct
him
and
not
over
safe
either
and
when
i
was
done
being
exhibited
then
ho
for
the
dungeon
but
he
clarence
would
find
a
way
to
come
and
see
me
every
now
and
then
and
cheer
me
up
and
help
me
get
word
to
my
friends
get
word
to
my
friends
i
thanked
him
i
couldn
t
do
less
and
about
this
time
a
lackey
came
to
say
i
was
wanted
so
clarence
led
me
in
and
took
me
off
to
one
side
and
sat
down
by
me
well
it
was
a
curious
kind
of
spectacle
and
interesting
it
was
an
immense
place
and
rather
naked
yes
and
full
of
loud
contrasts
it
was
very
very
lofty
so
lofty
that
the
banners
depending
from
the
arched
beams
and
girders
away
up
there
floated
in
a
sort
of
twilight
there
was
a
stone
railed
gallery
at
each
end
high
up
with
musicians
in
the
one
and
women
clothed
in
stunning
colors
in
the
other
the
floor
was
of
big
stone
flags
laid
in
black
and
white
squares
rather
battered
by
age
and
use
and
needing
repair
as
to
ornament
there
wasn
t
any
strictly
speaking
though
on
the
walls
hung
some
huge
tapestries
which
were
probably
taxed
as
works
of
art
battle
pieces
they
were
with
horses
shaped
like
those
which
children
cut
out
of
paper
or
create
in
gingerbread
with
men
on
them
in
scale
armor
whose
scales
are
represented
by
round
holes
so
that
the
man
s
coat
looks
as
if
it
had
been
done
with
a
biscuit
punch
there
was
a
fireplace
big
enough
to
camp
in
and
its
projecting
sides
and
hood
of
carved
and
pillared
stonework
had
the
look
of
a
cathedral
door
along
the
walls
stood
men
at
arms
in
breastplate
and
morion
with
halberds
for
their
only
weapon
rigid
as
statues
and
that
is
what
they
looked
like
in
the
middle
of
this
groined
and
vaulted
public
square
was
an
oaken
table
which
they
called
the
table
round
it
was
as
large
as
a
circus
ring
and
around
it
sat
a
great
company
of
men
dressed
in
such
various
and
splendid
colors
that
it
hurt
one
s
eyes
to
look
at
them
they
wore
their
plumed
hats
right
along
except
that
whenever
one
addressed
himself
directly
to
the
king
he
lifted
his
hat
a
trifle
just
as
he
was
beginning
his
remark
mainly
they
were
drinking
from
entire
ox
horns
but
a
few
were
still
munching
bread
or
gnawing
beef
bones
there
was
about
an
average
of
two
dogs
to
one
man
and
these
sat
in
expectant
attitudes
till
a
spent
bone
was
flung
to
them
and
then
they
went
for
it
by
brigades
and
divisions
with
a
rush
and
there
ensued
a
fight
which
filled
the
prospect
with
a
tumultuous
chaos
of
plunging
heads
and
bodies
and
flashing
tails
and
the
storm
of
howlings
and
barkings
deafened
all
speech
for
the
time
but
that
was
no
matter
for
the
dog
fight
was
always
a
bigger
interest
anyway
the
men
rose
sometimes
to
observe
it
the
better
and
bet
on
it
and
the
ladies
and
the
musicians
stretched
themselves
out
over
their
balusters
with
the
same
object
and
all
broke
into
delighted
ejaculations
from
time
to
time
in
the
end
the
winning
dog
stretched
himself
out
comfortably
with
his
bone
between
his
paws
and
proceeded
to
growl
over
it
and
gnaw
it
and
grease
the
floor
with
it
just
as
fifty
others
were
already
doing
and
the
rest
of
the
court
resumed
their
previous
industries
and
entertainments
as
a
rule
the
speech
and
behavior
of
these
people
were
gracious
and
courtly
and
i
noticed
that
they
were
good
and
serious
listeners
when
anybody
was
telling
anything
i
mean
in
a
dog
fightless
interval
and
plainly
too
they
were
a
childlike
and
innocent
lot
telling
lies
of
the
stateliest
pattern
with
a
most
gentle
and
winning
naivety
and
ready
and
willing
to
listen
to
anybody
else
s
lie
and
believe
it
too
it
was
hard
to
associate
them
with
anything
cruel
or
dreadful
and
yet
they
dealt
in
tales
of
blood
and
suffering
with
a
guileless
relish
that
made
me
almost
forget
to
shudder
i
was
not
the
only
prisoner
present
there
were
twenty
or
more
poor
devils
many
of
them
were
maimed
hacked
carved
in
a
frightful
way
and
their
hair
their
faces
their
clothing
were
caked
with
black
and
stiffened
drenchings
of
blood
they
were
suffering
sharp
physical
pain
of
course
and
weariness
and
hunger
and
thirst
no
doubt
and
at
least
none
had
given
them
the
comfort
of
a
wash
or
even
the
poor
charity
of
a
lotion
for
their
wounds
yet
you
never
heard
them
utter
a
moan
or
a
groan
or
saw
them
show
any
sign
of
restlessness
or
any
disposition
to
complain
the
thought
was
forced
upon
me
the
rascals
they
have
served
other
people
so
in
their
day
it
being
their
own
turn
now
they
were
not
expecting
any
better
treatment
than
this
so
their
philosophical
bearing
is
not
an
outcome
of
mental
training
intellectual
fortitude
reasoning
it
is
mere
animal
training
they
are
white
indians
chapter
iii
knights
of
the
table
round
mainly
the
round
table
talk
was
monologues
narrative
accounts
of
the
adventures
in
which
these
prisoners
were
captured
and
their
friends
and
backers
killed
and
stripped
of
their
steeds
and
armor
as
a
general
thing
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
these
murderous
adventures
were
not
forays
undertaken
to
avenge
injuries
nor
to
settle
old
disputes
or
sudden
fallings
out
no
as
a
rule
they
were
simply
duels
between
strangers
duels
between
people
who
had
never
even
been
introduced
to
each
other
and
between
whom
existed
no
cause
of
offense
whatever
many
a
time
i
had
seen
a
couple
of
boys
strangers
meet
by
chance
and
say
simultaneously
i
can
lick
you
and
go
at
it
on
the
spot
but
i
had
always
imagined
until
now
that
that
sort
of
thing
belonged
to
children
only
and
was
a
sign
and
mark
of
childhood
but
here
were
these
big
boobies
sticking
to
it
and
taking
pride
in
it
clear
up
into
full
age
and
beyond
yet
there
was
something
very
engaging
about
these
great
simple
hearted
creatures
something
attractive
and
lovable
there
did
not
seem
to
be
brains
enough
in
the
entire
nursery
so
to
speak
to
bait
a
fish
hook
with
but
you
didn
t
seem
to
mind
that
after
a
little
because
you
soon
saw
that
brains
were
not
needed
in
a
society
like
that
and
indeed
would
have
marred
it
hindered
it
spoiled
its
symmetry
perhaps
rendered
its
existence
impossible
there
was
a
fine
manliness
observable
in
almost
every
face
and
in
some
a
certain
loftiness
and
sweetness
that
rebuked
your
belittling
criticisms
and
stilled
them
a
most
noble
benignity
and
purity
reposed
in
the
countenance
of
him
they
called
sir
galahad
and
likewise
in
the
king
s
also
and
there
was
majesty
and
greatness
in
the
giant
frame
and
high
bearing
of
sir
launcelot
of
the
lake
there
was
presently
an
incident
which
centered
the
general
interest
upon
this
sir
launcelot
at
a
sign
from
a
sort
of
master
of
ceremonies
six
or
eight
of
the
prisoners
rose
and
came
forward
in
a
body
and
knelt
on
the
floor
and
lifted
up
their
hands
toward
the
ladies
gallery
and
begged
the
grace
of
a
word
with
the
queen
the
most
conspicuously
situated
lady
in
that
massed
flower
bed
of
feminine
show
and
finery
inclined
her
head
by
way
of
assent
and
then
the
spokesman
of
the
prisoners
delivered
himself
and
his
fellows
into
her
hands
for
free
pardon
ransom
captivity
or
death
as
she
in
her
good
pleasure
might
elect
and
this
as
he
said
he
was
doing
by
command
of
sir
kay
the
seneschal
whose
prisoners
they
were
he
having
vanquished
them
by
his
single
might
and
prowess
in
sturdy
conflict
in
the
field
surprise
and
astonishment
flashed
from
face
to
face
all
over
the
house
the
queen
s
gratified
smile
faded
out
at
the
name
of
sir
kay
and
she
looked
disappointed
and
the
page
whispered
in
my
ear
with
an
accent
and
manner
expressive
of
extravagant
derision
sir
kay
forsooth
oh
call
me
pet
names
dearest
call
me
a
marine
in
twice
a
thousand
years
shall
the
unholy
invention
of
man
labor
at
odds
to
beget
the
fellow
to
this
majestic
lie
every
eye
was
fastened
with
severe
inquiry
upon
sir
kay
but
he
was
equal
to
the
occasion
he
got
up
and
played
his
hand
like
a
major
and
took
every
trick
he
said
he
would
state
the
case
exactly
according
to
the
facts
he
would
tell
the
simple
straightforward
tale
without
comment
of
his
own
and
then
said
he
if
ye
find
glory
and
honor
due
ye
will
give
it
unto
him
who
is
the
mightiest
man
of
his
hands
that
ever
bare
shield
or
strake
with
sword
in
the
ranks
of
christian
battle
even
him
that
sitteth
there
and
he
pointed
to
sir
launcelot
ah
he
fetched
them
it
was
a
rattling
good
stroke
then
he
went
on
and
told
how
sir
launcelot
seeking
adventures
some
brief
time
gone
by
killed
seven
giants
at
one
sweep
of
his
sword
and
set
a
hundred
and
forty
two
captive
maidens
free
and
then
went
further
still
seeking
adventures
and
found
him
sir
kay
fighting
a
desperate
fight
against
nine
foreign
knights
and
straightway
took
the
battle
solely
into
his
own
hands
and
conquered
the
nine
and
that
night
sir
launcelot
rose
quietly
and
dressed
him
in
sir
kay
s
armor
and
took
sir
kay
s
horse
and
gat
him
away
into
distant
lands
and
vanquished
sixteen
knights
in
one
pitched
battle
and
thirty
four
in
another
and
all
these
and
the
former
nine
he
made
to
swear
that
about
whitsuntide
they
would
ride
to
arthur
s
court
and
yield
them
to
queen
guenever
s
hands
as
captives
of
sir
kay
the
seneschal
spoil
of
his
knightly
prowess
and
now
here
were
these
half
dozen
and
the
rest
would
be
along
as
soon
as
they
might
be
healed
of
their
desperate
wounds
well
it
was
touching
to
see
the
queen
blush
and
smile
and
look
embarrassed
and
happy
and
fling
furtive
glances
at
sir
launcelot
that
would
have
got
him
shot
in
arkansas
to
a
dead
certainty
everybody
praised
the
valor
and
magnanimity
of
sir
launcelot
and
as
for
me
i
was
perfectly
amazed
that
one
man
all
by
himself
should
have
been
able
to
beat
down
and
capture
such
battalions
of
practiced
fighters
i
said
as
much
to
clarence
but
this
mocking
featherhead
only
said
an
sir
kay
had
had
time
to
get
another
skin
of
sour
wine
into
him
ye
had
seen
the
accompt
doubled
i
looked
at
the
boy
in
sorrow
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
the
cloud
of
a
deep
despondency
settle
upon
his
countenance
i
followed
the
direction
of
his
eye
and
saw
that
a
very
old
and
white
bearded
man
clothed
in
a
flowing
black
gown
had
risen
and
was
standing
at
the
table
upon
unsteady
legs
and
feebly
swaying
his
ancient
head
and
surveying
the
company
with
his
watery
and
wandering
eye
the
same
suffering
look
that
was
in
the
page
s
face
was
observable
in
all
the
faces
around
the
look
of
dumb
creatures
who
know
that
they
must
endure
and
make
no
moan
marry
we
shall
have
it
again
sighed
the
boy
that
same
old
weary
tale
that
he
hath
told
a
thousand
times
in
the
same
words
and
that
he
will
tell
till
he
dieth
every
time
he
hath
gotten
his
barrel
full
and
feeleth
his
exaggeration
mill
a
working
would
god
i
had
died
or
i
saw
this
day
who
is
it
merlin
the
mighty
liar
and
magician
perdition
singe
him
for
the
weariness
he
worketh
with
his
one
tale
but
that
men
fear
him
for
that
he
hath
the
storms
and
the
lightnings
and
all
the
devils
that
be
in
hell
at
his
beck
and
call
they
would
have
dug
his
entrails
out
these
many
years
ago
to
get
at
that
tale
and
squelch
it
he
telleth
it
always
in
the
third
person
making
believe
he
is
too
modest
to
glorify
himself
maledictions
light
upon
him
misfortune
be
his
dole
good
friend
prithee
call
me
for
evensong
the
boy
nestled
himself
upon
my
shoulder
and
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
the
old
man
began
his
tale
and
presently
the
lad
was
asleep
in
reality
so
also
were
the
dogs
and
the
court
the
lackeys
and
the
files
of
men
at
arms
the
droning
voice
droned
on
a
soft
snoring
arose
on
all
sides
and
supported
it
like
a
deep
and
subdued
accompaniment
of
wind
instruments
some
heads
were
bowed
upon
folded
arms
some
lay
back
with
open
mouths
that
issued
unconscious
music
the
flies
buzzed
and
bit
unmolested
the
rats
swarmed
softly
out
from
a
hundred
holes
and
pattered
about
and
made
themselves
at
home
everywhere
and
one
of
them
sat
up
like
a
squirrel
on
the
king
s
head
and
held
a
bit
of
cheese
in
its
hands
and
nibbled
it
and
dribbled
the
crumbs
in
the
king
s
face
with
naive
and
impudent
irreverence
it
was
a
tranquil
scene
and
restful
to
the
weary
eye
and
the
jaded
spirit
this
was
the
old
man
s
tale
he
said
right
so
the
king
and
merlin
departed
and
went
until
an
hermit
that
was
a
good
man
and
a
great
leech
so
the
hermit
searched
all
his
wounds
and
gave
him
good
salves
so
the
king
was
there
three
days
and
then
were
his
wounds
well
amended
that
he
might
ride
and
go
and
so
departed
and
as
they
rode
arthur
said
i
have
no
sword
no
force
*
[*footnote
from
m
t
no
matter
]
said
merlin
hereby
is
a
sword
that
shall
be
yours
and
i
may
so
they
rode
till
they
came
to
a
lake
the
which
was
a
fair
water
and
broad
and
in
the
midst
of
the
lake
arthur
was
ware
of
an
arm
clothed
in
white
samite
that
held
a
fair
sword
in
that
hand
lo
said
merlin
yonder
is
that
sword
that
i
spake
of
with
that
they
saw
a
damsel
going
upon
the
lake
what
damsel
is
that
said
arthur
that
is
the
lady
of
the
lake
said
merlin
and
within
that
lake
is
a
rock
and
therein
is
as
fair
a
place
as
any
on
earth
and
richly
beseen
and
this
damsel
will
come
to
you
anon
and
then
speak
ye
fair
to
her
that
she
will
give
you
that
sword
anon
withal
came
the
damsel
unto
arthur
and
saluted
him
and
he
her
again
damsel
said
arthur
what
sword
is
that
that
yonder
the
arm
holdeth
above
the
water
i
would
it
were
mine
for
i
have
no
sword
sir
arthur
king
said
the
damsel
that
sword
is
mine
and
if
ye
will
give
me
a
gift
when
i
ask
it
you
ye
shall
have
it
by
my
faith
said
arthur
i
will
give
you
what
gift
ye
will
ask
well
said
the
damsel
go
ye
into
yonder
barge
and
row
yourself
to
the
sword
and
take
it
and
the
scabbard
with
you
and
i
will
ask
my
gift
when
i
see
my
time
so
sir
arthur
and
merlin
alight
and
tied
their
horses
to
two
trees
and
so
they
went
into
the
ship
and
when
they
came
to
the
sword
that
the
hand
held
sir
arthur
took
it
up
by
the
handles
and
took
it
with
him
and
the
arm
and
the
hand
went
under
the
water
and
so
they
came
unto
the
land
and
rode
forth
and
then
sir
arthur
saw
a
rich
pavilion
what
signifieth
yonder
pavilion
it
is
the
knight
s
pavilion
said
merlin
that
ye
fought
with
last
sir
pellinore
but
he
is
out
he
is
not
there
he
hath
ado
with
a
knight
of
yours
that
hight
egglame
and
they
have
fought
together
but
at
the
last
egglame
fled
and
else
he
had
been
dead
and
he
hath
chased
him
even
to
carlion
and
we
shall
meet
with
him
anon
in
the
highway
that
is
well
said
said
arthur
now
have
i
a
sword
now
will
i
wage
battle
with
him
and
be
avenged
on
him
sir
ye
shall
not
so
said
merlin
for
the
knight
is
weary
of
fighting
and
chasing
so
that
ye
shall
have
no
worship
to
have
ado
with
him
also
he
will
not
lightly
be
matched
of
one
knight
living
and
therefore
it
is
my
counsel
let
him
pass
for
he
shall
do
you
good
service
in
short
time
and
his
sons
after
his
days
also
ye
shall
see
that
day
in
short
space
ye
shall
be
right
glad
to
give
him
your
sister
to
wed
when
i
see
him
i
will
do
as
ye
advise
me
said
arthur
then
sir
arthur
looked
on
the
sword
and
liked
it
passing
well
whether
liketh
you
better
said
merlin
the
sword
or
the
scabbard
me
liketh
better
the
sword
said
arthur
ye
are
more
unwise
said
merlin
for
the
scabbard
is
worth
ten
of
the
sword
for
while
ye
have
the
scabbard
upon
you
ye
shall
never
lose
no
blood
be
ye
never
so
sore
wounded
therefore
keep
well
the
scabbard
always
with
you
so
they
rode
into
carlion
and
by
the
way
they
met
with
sir
pellinore
but
merlin
had
done
such
a
craft
that
pellinore
saw
not
arthur
and
he
passed
by
without
any
words
i
marvel
said
arthur
that
the
knight
would
not
speak
sir
said
merlin
he
saw
you
not
for
and
he
had
seen
you
ye
had
not
lightly
departed
so
they
came
unto
carlion
whereof
his
knights
were
passing
glad
and
when
they
heard
of
his
adventures
they
marveled
that
he
would
jeopard
his
person
so
alone
but
all
men
of
worship
said
it
was
merry
to
be
under
such
a
chieftain
that
would
put
his
person
in
adventure
as
other
poor
knights
did
chapter
iv
sir
dinadan
the
humorist
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
quaint
lie
was
most
simply
and
beautifully
told
but
then
i
had
heard
it
only
once
and
that
makes
a
difference
it
was
pleasant
to
the
others
when
it
was
fresh
no
doubt
sir
dinadan
the
humorist
was
the
first
to
awake
and
he
soon
roused
the
rest
with
a
practical
joke
of
a
sufficiently
poor
quality
he
tied
some
metal
mugs
to
a
dog
s
tail
and
turned
him
loose
and
he
tore
around
and
around
the
place
in
a
frenzy
of
fright
with
all
the
other
dogs
bellowing
after
him
and
battering
and
crashing
against
everything
that
came
in
their
way
and
making
altogether
a
chaos
of
confusion
and
a
most
deafening
din
and
turmoil
at
which
every
man
and
woman
of
the
multitude
laughed
till
the
tears
flowed
and
some
fell
out
of
their
chairs
and
wallowed
on
the
floor
in
ecstasy
it
was
just
like
so
many
children
sir
dinadan
was
so
proud
of
his
exploit
that
he
could
not
keep
from
telling
over
and
over
again
to
weariness
how
the
immortal
idea
happened
to
occur
to
him
and
as
is
the
way
with
humorists
of
his
breed
he
was
still
laughing
at
it
after
everybody
else
had
got
through
he
was
so
set
up
that
he
concluded
to
make
a
speech
of
course
a
humorous
speech
i
think
i
never
heard
so
many
old
played
out
jokes
strung
together
in
my
life
he
was
worse
than
the
minstrels
worse
than
the
clown
in
the
circus
it
seemed
peculiarly
sad
to
sit
here
thirteen
hundred
years
before
i
was
born
and
listen
again
to
poor
flat
worm
eaten
jokes
that
had
given
me
the
dry
gripes
when
i
was
a
boy
thirteen
hundred
years
afterwards
it
about
convinced
me
that
there
isn
t
any
such
thing
as
a
new
joke
possible
everybody
laughed
at
these
antiquities
but
then
they
always
do
i
had
noticed
that
centuries
later
however
of
course
the
scoffer
didn
t
laugh
i
mean
the
boy
no
he
scoffed
there
wasn
t
anything
he
wouldn
t
scoff
at
he
said
the
most
of
sir
dinadan
s
jokes
were
rotten
and
the
rest
were
petrified
i
said
petrified
was
good
as
i
believed
myself
that
the
only
right
way
to
classify
the
majestic
ages
of
some
of
those
jokes
was
by
geologic
periods
but
that
neat
idea
hit
the
boy
in
a
blank
place
for
geology
hadn
t
been
invented
yet
however
i
made
a
note
of
the
remark
and
calculated
to
educate
the
commonwealth
up
to
it
if
i
pulled
through
it
is
no
use
to
throw
a
good
thing
away
merely
because
the
market
isn
t
ripe
yet
now
sir
kay
arose
and
began
to
fire
up
on
his
history
mill
with
me
for
fuel
it
was
time
for
me
to
feel
serious
and
i
did
sir
kay
told
how
he
had
encountered
me
in
a
far
land
of
barbarians
who
all
wore
the
same
ridiculous
garb
that
i
did
a
garb
that
was
a
work
of
enchantment
and
intended
to
make
the
wearer
secure
from
hurt
by
human
hands
however
he
had
nullified
the
force
of
the
enchantment
by
prayer
and
had
killed
my
thirteen
knights
in
a
three
hours
battle
and
taken
me
prisoner
sparing
my
life
in
order
that
so
strange
a
curiosity
as
i
was
might
be
exhibited
to
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
the
king
and
the
court
he
spoke
of
me
all
the
time
in
the
blandest
way
as
this
prodigious
giant
and
this
horrible
sky
towering
monster
and
this
tusked
and
taloned
man
devouring
ogre
and
everybody
took
in
all
this
bosh
in
the
naivest
way
and
never
smiled
or
seemed
to
notice
that
there
was
any
discrepancy
between
these
watered
statistics
and
me
he
said
that
in
trying
to
escape
from
him
i
sprang
into
the
top
of
a
tree
two
hundred
cubits
high
at
a
single
bound
but
he
dislodged
me
with
a
stone
the
size
of
a
cow
which
all
to
brast
the
most
of
my
bones
and
then
swore
me
to
appear
at
arthur
s
court
for
sentence
he
ended
by
condemning
me
to
die
at
noon
on
the
21st
and
was
so
little
concerned
about
it
that
he
stopped
to
yawn
before
he
named
the
date
i
was
in
a
dismal
state
by
this
time
indeed
i
was
hardly
enough
in
my
right
mind
to
keep
the
run
of
a
dispute
that
sprung
up
as
to
how
i
had
better
be
killed
the
possibility
of
the
killing
being
doubted
by
some
because
of
the
enchantment
in
my
clothes
and
yet
it
was
nothing
but
an
ordinary
suit
of
fifteen
dollar
slop
shops
still
i
was
sane
enough
to
notice
this
detail
to
wit
many
of
the
terms
used
in
the
most
matter
of
fact
way
by
this
great
assemblage
of
the
first
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
land
would
have
made
a
comanche
blush
indelicacy
is
too
mild
a
term
to
convey
the
idea
however
i
had
read
tom
jones
and
roderick
random
and
other
books
of
that
kind
and
knew
that
the
highest
and
first
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
england
had
remained
little
or
no
cleaner
in
their
talk
and
in
the
morals
and
conduct
which
such
talk
implies
clear
up
to
a
hundred
years
ago
in
fact
clear
into
our
own
nineteenth
century
in
which
century
broadly
speaking
the
earliest
samples
of
the
real
lady
and
real
gentleman
discoverable
in
english
history
or
in
european
history
for
that
matter
may
be
said
to
have
made
their
appearance
suppose
sir
walter
instead
of
putting
the
conversations
into
the
mouths
of
his
characters
had
allowed
the
characters
to
speak
for
themselves
we
should
have
had
talk
from
rebecca
and
ivanhoe
and
the
soft
lady
rowena
which
would
embarrass
a
tramp
in
our
day
however
to
the
unconsciously
indelicate
all
things
are
delicate
king
arthur
s
people
were
not
aware
that
they
were
indecent
and
i
had
presence
of
mind
enough
not
to
mention
it
they
were
so
troubled
about
my
enchanted
clothes
that
they
were
mightily
relieved
at
last
when
old
merlin
swept
the
difficulty
away
for
them
with
a
common
sense
hint
he
asked
them
why
they
were
so
dull
why
didn
t
it
occur
to
them
to
strip
me
in
half
a
minute
i
was
as
naked
as
a
pair
of
tongs
and
dear
dear
to
think
of
it
i
was
the
only
embarrassed
person
there
everybody
discussed
me
and
did
it
as
unconcernedly
as
if
i
had
been
a
cabbage
queen
guenever
was
as
naively
interested
as
the
rest
and
said
she
had
never
seen
anybody
with
legs
just
like
mine
before
it
was
the
only
compliment
i
got
if
it
was
a
compliment
finally
i
was
carried
off
in
one
direction
and
my
perilous
clothes
in
another
i
was
shoved
into
a
dark
and
narrow
cell
in
a
dungeon
with
some
scant
remnants
for
dinner
some
moldy
straw
for
a
bed
and
no
end
of
rats
for
company
chapter
v
an
inspiration
i
was
so
tired
that
even
my
fears
were
not
able
to
keep
me
awake
long
when
i
next
came
to
myself
i
seemed
to
have
been
asleep
a
very
long
time
my
first
thought
was
well
what
an
astonishing
dream
i
ve
had
i
reckon
i
ve
waked
only
just
in
time
to
keep
from
being
hanged
or
drowned
or
burned
or
something
i
ll
nap
again
till
the
whistle
blows
and
then
i
ll
go
down
to
the
arms
factory
and
have
it
out
with
hercules
but
just
then
i
heard
the
harsh
music
of
rusty
chains
and
bolts
a
light
flashed
in
my
eyes
and
that
butterfly
clarence
stood
before
me
i
gasped
with
surprise
my
breath
almost
got
away
from
me
what
i
said
you
here
yet
go
along
with
the
rest
of
the
dream
scatter
but
he
only
laughed
in
his
light
hearted
way
and
fell
to
making
fun
of
my
sorry
plight
all
right
i
said
resignedly
let
the
dream
go
on
i
m
in
no
hurry
prithee
what
dream
what
dream
why
the
dream
that
i
am
in
arthur
s
court
a
person
who
never
existed
and
that
i
am
talking
to
you
who
are
nothing
but
a
work
of
the
imagination
oh
la
indeed
and
is
it
a
dream
that
you
re
to
be
burned
to
morrow
ho
ho
answer
me
that
the
shock
that
went
through
me
was
distressing
i
now
began
to
reason
that
my
situation
was
in
the
last
degree
serious
dream
or
no
dream
for
i
knew
by
past
experience
of
the
lifelike
intensity
of
dreams
that
to
be
burned
to
death
even
in
a
dream
would
be
very
far
from
being
a
jest
and
was
a
thing
to
be
avoided
by
any
means
fair
or
foul
that
i
could
contrive
so
i
said
beseechingly
ah
clarence
good
boy
only
friend
i
ve
got
for
you
are
my
friend
aren
t
you
don
t
fail
me
help
me
to
devise
some
way
of
escaping
from
this
place
now
do
but
hear
thyself
escape
why
man
the
corridors
are
in
guard
and
keep
of
men
at
arms
no
doubt
no
doubt
but
how
many
clarence
not
many
i
hope
full
a
score
one
may
not
hope
to
escape
after
a
pause
hesitatingly
and
there
be
other
reasons
and
weightier
other
ones
what
are
they
well
they
say
oh
but
i
daren
t
indeed
daren
t
why
poor
lad
what
is
the
matter
why
do
you
blench
why
do
you
tremble
so
oh
in
sooth
there
is
need
i
do
want
to
tell
you
but
come
come
be
brave
be
a
man
speak
out
there
s
a
good
lad
he
hesitated
pulled
one
way
by
desire
the
other
way
by
fear
then
he
stole
to
the
door
and
peeped
out
listening
and
finally
crept
close
to
me
and
put
his
mouth
to
my
ear
and
told
me
his
fearful
news
in
a
whisper
and
with
all
the
cowering
apprehension
of
one
who
was
venturing
upon
awful
ground
and
speaking
of
things
whose
very
mention
might
be
freighted
with
death
merlin
in
his
malice
has
woven
a
spell
about
this
dungeon
and
there
bides
not
the
man
in
these
kingdoms
that
would
be
desperate
enough
to
essay
to
cross
its
lines
with
you
now
god
pity
me
i
have
told
it
ah
be
kind
to
me
be
merciful
to
a
poor
boy
who
means
thee
well
for
an
thou
betray
me
i
am
lost
i
laughed
the
only
really
refreshing
laugh
i
had
had
for
some
time
and
shouted
merlin
has
wrought
a
spell
merlin
forsooth
that
cheap
old
humbug
that
maundering
old
ass
bosh
pure
bosh
the
silliest
bosh
in
the
world
why
it
does
seem
to
me
that
of
all
the
childish
idiotic
chuckle
headed
chicken
livered
superstitions
that
ev
oh
damn
merlin
but
clarence
had
slumped
to
his
knees
before
i
had
half
finished
and
he
was
like
to
go
out
of
his
mind
with
fright
oh
beware
these
are
awful
words
any
moment
these
walls
may
crumble
upon
us
if
you
say
such
things
oh
call
them
back
before
it
is
too
late
now
this
strange
exhibition
gave
me
a
good
idea
and
set
me
to
thinking
if
everybody
about
here
was
so
honestly
and
sincerely
afraid
of
merlin
s
pretended
magic
as
clarence
was
certainly
a
superior
man
like
me
ought
to
be
shrewd
enough
to
contrive
some
way
to
take
advantage
of
such
a
state
of
things
i
went
on
thinking
and
worked
out
a
plan
then
i
said
get
up
pull
yourself
together
look
me
in
the
eye
do
you
know
why
i
laughed
no
but
for
our
blessed
lady
s
sake
do
it
no
more
well
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
laughed
because
i
m
a
magician
myself
thou
the
boy
recoiled
a
step
and
caught
his
breath
for
the
thing
hit
him
rather
sudden
but
the
aspect
which
he
took
on
was
very
very
respectful
i
took
quick
note
of
that
it
indicated
that
a
humbug
didn
t
need
to
have
a
reputation
in
this
asylum
people
stood
ready
to
take
him
at
his
word
without
that
i
resumed
i
ve
known
merlin
seven
hundred
years
and
he
seven
hun
don
t
interrupt
me
he
has
died
and
come
alive
again
thirteen
times
and
traveled
under
a
new
name
every
time
smith
jones
robinson
jackson
peters
haskins
merlin
a
new
alias
every
time
he
turns
up
i
knew
him
in
egypt
three
hundred
years
ago
i
knew
him
in
india
five
hundred
years
ago
he
is
always
blethering
around
in
my
way
everywhere
i
go
he
makes
me
tired
he
don
t
amount
to
shucks
as
a
magician
knows
some
of
the
old
common
tricks
but
has
never
got
beyond
the
rudiments
and
never
will
he
is
well
enough
for
the
provinces
one
night
stands
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
but
dear
me
he
oughtn
t
to
set
up
for
an
expert
anyway
not
where
there
s
a
real
artist
now
look
here
clarence
i
am
going
to
stand
your
friend
right
along
and
in
return
you
must
be
mine
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
i
want
you
to
get
word
to
the
king
that
i
am
a
magician
myself
and
the
supreme
grand
high
yu
muck
amuck
and
head
of
the
tribe
at
that
and
i
want
him
to
be
made
to
understand
that
i
am
just
quietly
arranging
a
little
calamity
here
that
will
make
the
fur
fly
in
these
realms
if
sir
kay
s
project
is
carried
out
and
any
harm
comes
to
me
will
you
get
that
to
the
king
for
me
the
poor
boy
was
in
such
a
state
that
he
could
hardly
answer
me
it
was
pitiful
to
see
a
creature
so
terrified
so
unnerved
so
demoralized
but
he
promised
everything
and
on
my
side
he
made
me
promise
over
and
over
again
that
i
would
remain
his
friend
and
never
turn
against
him
or
cast
any
enchantments
upon
him
then
he
worked
his
way
out
staying
himself
with
his
hand
along
the
wall
like
a
sick
person
presently
this
thought
occurred
to
me
how
heedless
i
have
been
when
the
boy
gets
calm
he
will
wonder
why
a
great
magician
like
me
should
have
begged
a
boy
like
him
to
help
me
get
out
of
this
place
he
will
put
this
and
that
together
and
will
see
that
i
am
a
humbug
i
worried
over
that
heedless
blunder
for
an
hour
and
called
myself
a
great
many
hard
names
meantime
but
finally
it
occurred
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
these
animals
didn
t
reason
that
they
never
put
this
and
that
together
that
all
their
talk
showed
that
they
didn
t
know
a
discrepancy
when
they
saw
it
i
was
at
rest
then
but
as
soon
as
one
is
at
rest
in
this
world
off
he
goes
on
something
else
to
worry
about
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
made
another
blunder
i
had
sent
the
boy
off
to
alarm
his
betters
with
a
threat
i
intending
to
invent
a
calamity
at
my
leisure
now
the
people
who
are
the
readiest
and
eagerest
and
willingest
to
swallow
miracles
are
the
very
ones
who
are
hungriest
to
see
you
perform
them
suppose
i
should
be
called
on
for
a
sample
suppose
i
should
be
asked
to
name
my
calamity
yes
i
had
made
a
blunder
i
ought
to
have
invented
my
calamity
first
what
shall
i
do
what
can
i
say
to
gain
a
little
time
i
was
in
trouble
again
in
the
deepest
kind
of
trouble
there
s
a
footstep
they
re
coming
if
i
had
only
just
a
moment
to
think
good
i
ve
got
it
i
m
all
right
you
see
it
was
the
eclipse
it
came
into
my
mind
in
the
nick
of
time
how
columbus
or
cortez
or
one
of
those
people
played
an
eclipse
as
a
saving
trump
once
on
some
savages
and
i
saw
my
chance
i
could
play
it
myself
now
and
it
wouldn
t
be
any
plagiarism
either
because
i
should
get
it
in
nearly
a
thousand
years
ahead
of
those
parties
clarence
came
in
subdued
distressed
and
said
i
hasted
the
message
to
our
liege
the
king
and
straightway
he
had
me
to
his
presence
he
was
frighted
even
to
the
marrow
and
was
minded
to
give
order
for
your
instant
enlargement
and
that
you
be
clothed
in
fine
raiment
and
lodged
as
befitted
one
so
great
but
then
came
merlin
and
spoiled
all
for
he
persuaded
the
king
that
you
are
mad
and
know
not
whereof
you
speak
and
said
your
threat
is
but
foolishness
and
idle
vaporing
they
disputed
long
but
in
the
end
merlin
scoffing
said
wherefore
hath
he
not
named
his
brave
calamity
verily
it
is
because
he
cannot
this
thrust
did
in
a
most
sudden
sort
close
the
king
s
mouth
and
he
could
offer
naught
to
turn
the
argument
and
so
reluctant
and
full
loth
to
do
you
the
discourtesy
he
yet
prayeth
you
to
consider
his
perplexed
case
as
noting
how
the
matter
stands
and
name
the
calamity
if
so
be
you
have
determined
the
nature
of
it
and
the
time
of
its
coming
oh
prithee
delay
not
to
delay
at
such
a
time
were
to
double
and
treble
the
perils
that
already
compass
thee
about
oh
be
thou
wise
name
the
calamity
i
allowed
silence
to
accumulate
while
i
got
my
impressiveness
together
and
then
said
how
long
have
i
been
shut
up
in
this
hole
ye
were
shut
up
when
yesterday
was
well
spent
it
is
9
of
the
morning
now
no
then
i
have
slept
well
sure
enough
nine
in
the
morning
now
and
yet
it
is
the
very
complexion
of
midnight
to
a
shade
this
is
the
20th
then
the
20th
yes
and
i
am
to
be
burned
alive
to
morrow
the
boy
shuddered
at
what
hour
at
high
noon
now
then
i
will
tell
you
what
to
say
i
paused
and
stood
over
that
cowering
lad
a
whole
minute
in
awful
silence
then
in
a
voice
deep
measured
charged
with
doom
i
began
and
rose
by
dramatically
graded
stages
to
my
colossal
climax
which
i
delivered
in
as
sublime
and
noble
a
way
as
ever
i
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
go
back
and
tell
the
king
that
at
that
hour
i
will
smother
the
whole
world
in
the
dead
blackness
of
midnight
i
will
blot
out
the
sun
and
he
shall
never
shine
again
the
fruits
of
the
earth
shall
rot
for
lack
of
light
and
warmth
and
the
peoples
of
the
earth
shall
famish
and
die
to
the
last
man
i
had
to
carry
the
boy
out
myself
he
sunk
into
such
a
collapse
i
handed
him
over
to
the
soldiers
and
went
back
chapter
vi
the
eclipse
in
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
realization
soon
began
to
supplement
knowledge
the
mere
knowledge
of
a
fact
is
pale
but
when
you
come
to
realize
your
fact
it
takes
on
color
it
is
all
the
difference
between
hearing
of
a
man
being
stabbed
to
the
heart
and
seeing
it
done
in
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
the
knowledge
that
i
was
in
deadly
danger
took
to
itself
deeper
and
deeper
meaning
all
the
time
a
something
which
was
realization
crept
inch
by
inch
through
my
veins
and
turned
me
cold
but
it
is
a
blessed
provision
of
nature
that
at
times
like
these
as
soon
as
a
man
s
mercury
has
got
down
to
a
certain
point
there
comes
a
revulsion
and
he
rallies
hope
springs
up
and
cheerfulness
along
with
it
and
then
he
is
in
good
shape
to
do
something
for
himself
if
anything
can
be
done
when
my
rally
came
it
came
with
a
bound
i
said
to
myself
that
my
eclipse
would
be
sure
to
save
me
and
make
me
the
greatest
man
in
the
kingdom
besides
and
straightway
my
mercury
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
tube
and
my
solicitudes
all
vanished
i
was
as
happy
a
man
as
there
was
in
the
world
i
was
even
impatient
for
to
morrow
to
come
i
so
wanted
to
gather
in
that
great
triumph
and
be
the
center
of
all
the
nation
s
wonder
and
reverence
besides
in
a
business
way
it
would
be
the
making
of
me
i
knew
that
meantime
there
was
one
thing
which
had
got
pushed
into
the
background
of
my
mind
that
was
the
half
conviction
that
when
the
nature
of
my
proposed
calamity
should
be
reported
to
those
superstitious
people
it
would
have
such
an
effect
that
they
would
want
to
compromise
so
by
and
by
when
i
heard
footsteps
coming
that
thought
was
recalled
to
me
and
i
said
to
myself
as
sure
as
anything
it
s
the
compromise
well
if
it
is
good
all
right
i
will
accept
but
if
it
isn
t
i
mean
to
stand
my
ground
and
play
my
hand
for
all
it
is
worth
the
door
opened
and
some
men
at
arms
appeared
the
leader
said
the
stake
is
ready
come
the
stake
the
strength
went
out
of
me
and
i
almost
fell
down
it
is
hard
to
get
one
s
breath
at
such
a
time
such
lumps
come
into
one
s
throat
and
such
gaspings
but
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
i
said
but
this
is
a
mistake
the
execution
is
to
morrow
order
changed
been
set
forward
a
day
haste
thee
i
was
lost
there
was
no
help
for
me
i
was
dazed
stupefied
i
had
no
command
over
myself
i
only
wandered
purposely
about
like
one
out
of
his
mind
so
the
soldiers
took
hold
of
me
and
pulled
me
along
with
them
out
of
the
cell
and
along
the
maze
of
underground
corridors
and
finally
into
the
fierce
glare
of
daylight
and
the
upper
world
as
we
stepped
into
the
vast
enclosed
court
of
the
castle
i
got
a
shock
for
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
stake
standing
in
the
center
and
near
it
the
piled
fagots
and
a
monk
on
all
four
sides
of
the
court
the
seated
multitudes
rose
rank
above
rank
forming
sloping
terraces
that
were
rich
with
color
the
king
and
the
queen
sat
in
their
thrones
the
most
conspicuous
figures
there
of
course
to
note
all
this
occupied
but
a
second
the
next
second
clarence
had
slipped
from
some
place
of
concealment
and
was
pouring
news
into
my
ear
his
eyes
beaming
with
triumph
and
gladness
he
said
tis
through
me
the
change
was
wrought
and
main
hard
have
i
worked
to
do
it
too
but
when
i
revealed
to
them
the
calamity
in
store
and
saw
how
mighty
was
the
terror
it
did
engender
then
saw
i
also
that
this
was
the
time
to
strike
wherefore
i
diligently
pretended
unto
this
and
that
and
the
other
one
that
your
power
against
the
sun
could
not
reach
its
full
until
the
morrow
and
so
if
any
would
save
the
sun
and
the
world
you
must
be
slain
to
day
while
your
enchantments
are
but
in
the
weaving
and
lack
potency
odsbodikins
it
was
but
a
dull
lie
a
most
indifferent
invention
but
you
should
have
seen
them
seize
it
and
swallow
it
in
the
frenzy
of
their
fright
as
it
were
salvation
sent
from
heaven
and
all
the
while
was
i
laughing
in
my
sleeve
the
one
moment
to
see
them
so
cheaply
deceived
and
glorifying
god
the
next
that
he
was
content
to
let
the
meanest
of
his
creatures
be
his
instrument
to
the
saving
of
thy
life
ah
how
happy
has
the
matter
sped
you
will
not
need
to
do
the
sun
a
real
hurt
ah
forget
not
that
on
your
soul
forget
it
not
only
make
a
little
darkness
only
the
littlest
little
darkness
mind
and
cease
with
that
it
will
be
sufficient
they
will
see
that
i
spoke
falsely
being
ignorant
as
they
will
fancy
and
with
the
falling
of
the
first
shadow
of
that
darkness
you
shall
see
them
go
mad
with
fear
and
they
will
set
you
free
and
make
you
great
go
to
thy
triumph
now
but
remember
ah
good
friend
i
implore
thee
remember
my
supplication
and
do
the
blessed
sun
no
hurt
for
my
sake
thy
true
friend
i
choked
out
some
words
through
my
grief
and
misery
as
much
as
to
say
i
would
spare
the
sun
for
which
the
lad
s
eyes
paid
me
back
with
such
deep
and
loving
gratitude
that
i
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
him
his
good
hearted
foolishness
had
ruined
me
and
sent
me
to
my
death
as
the
soldiers
assisted
me
across
the
court
the
stillness
was
so
profound
that
if
i
had
been
blindfold
i
should
have
supposed
i
was
in
a
solitude
instead
of
walled
in
by
four
thousand
people
there
was
not
a
movement
perceptible
in
those
masses
of
humanity
they
were
as
rigid
as
stone
images
and
as
pale
and
dread
sat
upon
every
countenance
this
hush
continued
while
i
was
being
chained
to
the
stake
it
still
continued
while
the
fagots
were
carefully
and
tediously
piled
about
my
ankles
my
knees
my
thighs
my
body
then
there
was
a
pause
and
a
deeper
hush
if
possible
and
a
man
knelt
down
at
my
feet
with
a
blazing
torch
the
multitude
strained
forward
gazing
and
parting
slightly
from
their
seats
without
knowing
it
the
monk
raised
his
hands
above
my
head
and
his
eyes
toward
the
blue
sky
and
began
some
words
in
latin
in
this
attitude
he
droned
on
and
on
a
little
while
and
then
stopped
i
waited
two
or
three
moments
then
looked
up
he
was
standing
there
petrified
with
a
common
impulse
the
multitude
rose
slowly
up
and
stared
into
the
sky
i
followed
their
eyes
as
sure
as
guns
there
was
my
eclipse
beginning
the
life
went
boiling
through
my
veins
i
was
a
new
man
the
rim
of
black
spread
slowly
into
the
sun
s
disk
my
heart
beat
higher
and
higher
and
still
the
assemblage
and
the
priest
stared
into
the
sky
motionless
i
knew
that
this
gaze
would
be
turned
upon
me
next
when
it
was
i
was
ready
i
was
in
one
of
the
most
grand
attitudes
i
ever
struck
with
my
arm
stretched
up
pointing
to
the
sun
it
was
a
noble
effect
you
could
see
the
shudder
sweep
the
mass
like
a
wave
two
shouts
rang
out
one
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
other
apply
the
torch
i
forbid
it
the
one
was
from
merlin
the
other
from
the
king
merlin
started
from
his
place
to
apply
the
torch
himself
i
judged
i
said
stay
where
you
are
if
any
man
moves
even
the
king
before
i
give
him
leave
i
will
blast
him
with
thunder
i
will
consume
him
with
lightnings
the
multitude
sank
meekly
into
their
seats
and
i
was
just
expecting
they
would
merlin
hesitated
a
moment
or
two
and
i
was
on
pins
and
needles
during
that
little
while
then
he
sat
down
and
i
took
a
good
breath
for
i
knew
i
was
master
of
the
situation
now
the
king
said
be
merciful
fair
sir
and
essay
no
further
in
this
perilous
matter
lest
disaster
follow
it
was
reported
to
us
that
your
powers
could
not
attain
unto
their
full
strength
until
the
morrow
but
your
majesty
thinks
the
report
may
have
been
a
lie
it
was
a
lie
that
made
an
immense
effect
up
went
appealing
hands
everywhere
and
the
king
was
assailed
with
a
storm
of
supplications
that
i
might
be
bought
off
at
any
price
and
the
calamity
stayed
the
king
was
eager
to
comply
he
said
name
any
terms
reverend
sir
even
to
the
halving
of
my
kingdom
but
banish
this
calamity
spare
the
sun
my
fortune
was
made
i
would
have
taken
him
up
in
a
minute
but
i
couldn
t
stop
an
eclipse
the
thing
was
out
of
the
question
so
i
asked
time
to
consider
the
king
said
how
long
ah
how
long
good
sir
be
merciful
look
it
groweth
darker
moment
by
moment
prithee
how
long
not
long
half
an
hour
maybe
an
hour
there
were
a
thousand
pathetic
protests
but
i
couldn
t
shorten
up
any
for
i
couldn
t
remember
how
long
a
total
eclipse
lasts
i
was
in
a
puzzled
condition
anyway
and
wanted
to
think
something
was
wrong
about
that
eclipse
and
the
fact
was
very
unsettling
if
this
wasn
t
the
one
i
was
after
how
was
i
to
tell
whether
this
was
the
sixth
century
or
nothing
but
a
dream
dear
me
if
i
could
only
prove
it
was
the
latter
here
was
a
glad
new
hope
if
the
boy
was
right
about
the
date
and
this
was
surely
the
20th
it
wasn
t
the
sixth
century
i
reached
for
the
monk
s
sleeve
in
considerable
excitement
and
asked
him
what
day
of
the
month
it
was
hang
him
he
said
it
was
the
twenty
first
it
made
me
turn
cold
to
hear
him
i
begged
him
not
to
make
any
mistake
about
it
but
he
was
sure
he
knew
it
was
the
21st
so
that
feather
headed
boy
had
botched
things
again
the
time
of
the
day
was
right
for
the
eclipse
i
had
seen
that
for
myself
in
the
beginning
by
the
dial
that
was
near
by
yes
i
was
in
king
arthur
s
court
and
i
might
as
well
make
the
most
out
of
it
i
could
the
darkness
was
steadily
growing
the
people
becoming
more
and
more
distressed
i
now
said
i
have
reflected
sir
king
for
a
lesson
i
will
let
this
darkness
proceed
and
spread
night
in
the
world
but
whether
i
blot
out
the
sun
for
good
or
restore
it
shall
rest
with
you
these
are
the
terms
to
wit
you
shall
remain
king
over
all
your
dominions
and
receive
all
the
glories
and
honors
that
belong
to
the
kingship
but
you
shall
appoint
me
your
perpetual
minister
and
executive
and
give
me
for
my
services
one
per
cent
of
such
actual
increase
of
revenue
over
and
above
its
present
amount
as
i
may
succeed
in
creating
for
the
state
if
i
can
t
live
on
that
i
sha
n
t
ask
anybody
to
give
me
a
lift
is
it
satisfactory
there
was
a
prodigious
roar
of
applause
and
out
of
the
midst
of
it
the
king
s
voice
rose
saying
away
with
his
bonds
and
set
him
free
and
do
him
homage
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
for
he
is
become
the
king
s
right
hand
is
clothed
with
power
and
authority
and
his
seat
is
upon
the
highest
step
of
the
throne
now
sweep
away
this
creeping
night
and
bring
the
light
and
cheer
again
that
all
the
world
may
bless
thee
but
i
said
that
a
common
man
should
be
shamed
before
the
world
is
nothing
but
it
were
dishonor
to
the
king
if
any
that
saw
his
minister
naked
should
not
also
see
him
delivered
from
his
shame
if
i
might
ask
that
my
clothes
be
brought
again
they
are
not
meet
the
king
broke
in
fetch
raiment
of
another
sort
clothe
him
like
a
prince
my
idea
worked
i
wanted
to
keep
things
as
they
were
till
the
eclipse
was
total
otherwise
they
would
be
trying
again
to
get
me
to
dismiss
the
darkness
and
of
course
i
couldn
t
do
it
sending
for
the
clothes
gained
some
delay
but
not
enough
so
i
had
to
make
another
excuse
i
said
it
would
be
but
natural
if
the
king
should
change
his
mind
and
repent
to
some
extent
of
what
he
had
done
under
excitement
therefore
i
would
let
the
darkness
grow
a
while
and
if
at
the
end
of
a
reasonable
time
the
king
had
kept
his
mind
the
same
the
darkness
should
be
dismissed
neither
the
king
nor
anybody
else
was
satisfied
with
that
arrangement
but
i
had
to
stick
to
my
point
it
grew
darker
and
darker
and
blacker
and
blacker
while
i
struggled
with
those
awkward
sixth
century
clothes
it
got
to
be
pitch
dark
at
last
and
the
multitude
groaned
with
horror
to
feel
the
cold
uncanny
night
breezes
fan
through
the
place
and
see
the
stars
come
out
and
twinkle
in
the
sky
at
last
the
eclipse
was
total
and
i
was
very
glad
of
it
but
everybody
else
was
in
misery
which
was
quite
natural
i
said
the
king
by
his
silence
still
stands
to
the
terms
then
i
lifted
up
my
hands
stood
just
so
a
moment
then
i
said
with
the
most
awful
solemnity
let
the
enchantment
dissolve
and
pass
harmless
away
there
was
no
response
for
a
moment
in
that
deep
darkness
and
that
graveyard
hush
but
when
the
silver
rim
of
the
sun
pushed
itself
out
a
moment
or
two
later
the
assemblage
broke
loose
with
a
vast
shout
and
came
pouring
down
like
a
deluge
to
smother
me
with
blessings
and
gratitude
and
clarence
was
not
the
last
of
the
wash
to
be
sure
chapter
vii
merlin
s
tower
inasmuch
as
i
was
now
the
second
personage
in
the
kingdom
as
far
as
political
power
and
authority
were
concerned
much
was
made
of
me
my
raiment
was
of
silks
and
velvets
and
cloth
of
gold
and
by
consequence
was
very
showy
also
uncomfortable
but
habit
would
soon
reconcile
me
to
my
clothes
i
was
aware
of
that
i
was
given
the
choicest
suite
of
apartments
in
the
castle
after
the
king
s
they
were
aglow
with
loud
colored
silken
hangings
but
the
stone
floors
had
nothing
but
rushes
on
them
for
a
carpet
and
they
were
misfit
rushes
at
that
being
not
all
of
one
breed
as
for
conveniences
properly
speaking
there
weren
t
any
i
mean
little
conveniences
it
is
the
little
conveniences
that
make
the
real
comfort
of
life
the
big
oaken
chairs
graced
with
rude
carvings
were
well
enough
but
that
was
the
stopping
place
there
was
no
soap
no
matches
no
looking
glass
except
a
metal
one
about
as
powerful
as
a
pail
of
water
and
not
a
chromo
i
had
been
used
to
chromos
for
years
and
i
saw
now
that
without
my
suspecting
it
a
passion
for
art
had
got
worked
into
the
fabric
of
my
being
and
was
become
a
part
of
me
it
made
me
homesick
to
look
around
over
this
proud
and
gaudy
but
heartless
barrenness
and
remember
that
in
our
house
in
east
hartford
all
unpretending
as
it
was
you
couldn
t
go
into
a
room
but
you
would
find
an
insurance
chromo
or
at
least
a
three
color
god
bless
our
home
over
the
door
and
in
the
parlor
we
had
nine
but
here
even
in
my
grand
room
of
state
there
wasn
t
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
picture
except
a
thing
the
size
of
a
bedquilt
which
was
either
woven
or
knitted
it
had
darned
places
in
it
and
nothing
in
it
was
the
right
color
or
the
right
shape
and
as
for
proportions
even
raphael
himself
couldn
t
have
botched
them
more
formidably
after
all
his
practice
on
those
nightmares
they
call
his
celebrated
hampton
court
cartoons
raphael
was
a
bird
we
had
several
of
his
chromos
one
was
his
miraculous
draught
of
fishes
where
he
puts
in
a
miracle
of
his
own
puts
three
men
into
a
canoe
which
wouldn
t
have
held
a
dog
without
upsetting
i
always
admired
to
study
r
s
art
it
was
so
fresh
and
unconventional
there
wasn
t
even
a
bell
or
a
speaking
tube
in
the
castle
i
had
a
great
many
servants
and
those
that
were
on
duty
lolled
in
the
anteroom
and
when
i
wanted
one
of
them
i
had
to
go
and
call
for
him
there
was
no
gas
there
were
no
candles
a
bronze
dish
half
full
of
boarding
house
butter
with
a
blazing
rag
floating
in
it
was
the
thing
that
produced
what
was
regarded
as
light
a
lot
of
these
hung
along
the
walls
and
modified
the
dark
just
toned
it
down
enough
to
make
it
dismal
if
you
went
out
at
night
your
servants
carried
torches
there
were
no
books
pens
paper
or
ink
and
no
glass
in
the
openings
they
believed
to
be
windows
it
is
a
little
thing
glass
is
until
it
is
absent
then
it
becomes
a
big
thing
but
perhaps
the
worst
of
all
was
that
there
wasn
t
any
sugar
coffee
tea
or
tobacco
i
saw
that
i
was
just
another
robinson
crusoe
cast
away
on
an
uninhabited
island
with
no
society
but
some
more
or
less
tame
animals
and
if
i
wanted
to
make
life
bearable
i
must
do
as
he
did
invent
contrive
create
reorganize
things
set
brain
and
hand
to
work
and
keep
them
busy
well
that
was
in
my
line
one
thing
troubled
me
along
at
first
the
immense
interest
which
people
took
in
me
apparently
the
whole
nation
wanted
a
look
at
me
it
soon
transpired
that
the
eclipse
had
scared
the
british
world
almost
to
death
that
while
it
lasted
the
whole
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
panic
and
the
churches
hermitages
and
monkeries
overflowed
with
praying
and
weeping
poor
creatures
who
thought
the
end
of
the
world
was
come
then
had
followed
the
news
that
the
producer
of
this
awful
event
was
a
stranger
a
mighty
magician
at
arthur
s
court
that
he
could
have
blown
out
the
sun
like
a
candle
and
was
just
going
to
do
it
when
his
mercy
was
purchased
and
he
then
dissolved
his
enchantments
and
was
now
recognized
and
honored
as
the
man
who
had
by
his
unaided
might
saved
the
globe
from
destruction
and
its
peoples
from
extinction
now
if
you
consider
that
everybody
believed
that
and
not
only
believed
it
but
never
even
dreamed
of
doubting
it
you
will
easily
understand
that
there
was
not
a
person
in
all
britain
that
would
not
have
walked
fifty
miles
to
get
a
sight
of
me
of
course
i
was
all
the
talk
all
other
subjects
were
dropped
even
the
king
became
suddenly
a
person
of
minor
interest
and
notoriety
within
twenty
four
hours
the
delegations
began
to
arrive
and
from
that
time
onward
for
a
fortnight
they
kept
coming
the
village
was
crowded
and
all
the
countryside
i
had
to
go
out
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
show
myself
to
these
reverent
and
awe
stricken
multitudes
it
came
to
be
a
great
burden
as
to
time
and
trouble
but
of
course
it
was
at
the
same
time
compensatingly
agreeable
to
be
so
celebrated
and
such
a
center
of
homage
it
turned
brer
merlin
green
with
envy
and
spite
which
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
but
there
was
one
thing
i
couldn
t
understand
nobody
had
asked
for
an
autograph
i
spoke
to
clarence
about
it
by
george
i
had
to
explain
to
him
what
it
was
then
he
said
nobody
in
the
country
could
read
or
write
but
a
few
dozen
priests
land
think
of
that
there
was
another
thing
that
troubled
me
a
little
those
multitudes
presently
began
to
agitate
for
another
miracle
that
was
natural
to
be
able
to
carry
back
to
their
far
homes
the
boast
that
they
had
seen
the
man
who
could
command
the
sun
riding
in
the
heavens
and
be
obeyed
would
make
them
great
in
the
eyes
of
their
neighbors
and
envied
by
them
all
but
to
be
able
to
also
say
they
had
seen
him
work
a
miracle
themselves
why
people
would
come
a
distance
to
see
them
the
pressure
got
to
be
pretty
strong
there
was
going
to
be
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
and
i
knew
the
date
and
hour
but
it
was
too
far
away
two
years
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
license
to
hurry
it
up
and
use
it
now
when
there
was
a
big
market
for
it
it
seemed
a
great
pity
to
have
it
wasted
so
and
come
lagging
along
at
a
time
when
a
body
wouldn
t
have
any
use
for
it
as
like
as
not
if
it
had
been
booked
for
only
a
month
away
i
could
have
sold
it
short
but
as
matters
stood
i
couldn
t
seem
to
cipher
out
any
way
to
make
it
do
me
any
good
so
i
gave
up
trying
next
clarence
found
that
old
merlin
was
making
himself
busy
on
the
sly
among
those
people
he
was
spreading
a
report
that
i
was
a
humbug
and
that
the
reason
i
didn
t
accommodate
the
people
with
a
miracle
was
because
i
couldn
t
i
saw
that
i
must
do
something
i
presently
thought
out
a
plan
by
my
authority
as
executive
i
threw
merlin
into
prison
the
same
cell
i
had
occupied
myself
then
i
gave
public
notice
by
herald
and
trumpet
that
i
should
be
busy
with
affairs
of
state
for
a
fortnight
but
about
the
end
of
that
time
i
would
take
a
moment
s
leisure
and
blow
up
merlin
s
stone
tower
by
fires
from
heaven
in
the
meantime
whoso
listened
to
evil
reports
about
me
let
him
beware
furthermore
i
would
perform
but
this
one
miracle
at
this
time
and
no
more
if
it
failed
to
satisfy
and
any
murmured
i
would
turn
the
murmurers
into
horses
and
make
them
useful
quiet
ensued
i
took
clarence
into
my
confidence
to
a
certain
degree
and
we
went
to
work
privately
i
told
him
that
this
was
a
sort
of
miracle
that
required
a
trifle
of
preparation
and
that
it
would
be
sudden
death
to
ever
talk
about
these
preparations
to
anybody
that
made
his
mouth
safe
enough
clandestinely
we
made
a
few
bushels
of
first
rate
blasting
powder
and
i
superintended
my
armorers
while
they
constructed
a
lightning
rod
and
some
wires
this
old
stone
tower
was
very
massive
and
rather
ruinous
too
for
it
was
roman
and
four
hundred
years
old
yes
and
handsome
after
a
rude
fashion
and
clothed
with
ivy
from
base
to
summit
as
with
a
shirt
of
scale
mail
it
stood
on
a
lonely
eminence
in
good
view
from
the
castle
and
about
half
a
mile
away
working
by
night
we
stowed
the
powder
in
the
tower
dug
stones
out
on
the
inside
and
buried
the
powder
in
the
walls
themselves
which
were
fifteen
feet
thick
at
the
base
we
put
in
a
peck
at
a
time
in
a
dozen
places
we
could
have
blown
up
the
tower
of
london
with
these
charges
when
the
thirteenth
night
was
come
we
put
up
our
lightning
rod
bedded
it
in
one
of
the
batches
of
powder
and
ran
wires
from
it
to
the
other
batches
everybody
had
shunned
that
locality
from
the
day
of
my
proclamation
but
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
i
thought
best
to
warn
the
people
through
the
heralds
to
keep
clear
away
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
then
added
by
command
that
at
some
time
during
the
twenty
four
hours
i
would
consummate
the
miracle
but
would
first
give
a
brief
notice
by
flags
on
the
castle
towers
if
in
the
daytime
by
torch
baskets
in
the
same
places
if
at
night
thunder
showers
had
been
tolerably
frequent
of
late
and
i
was
not
much
afraid
of
a
failure
still
i
shouldn
t
have
cared
for
a
delay
of
a
day
or
two
i
should
have
explained
that
i
was
busy
with
affairs
of
state
yet
and
the
people
must
wait
of
course
we
had
a
blazing
sunny
day
almost
the
first
one
without
a
cloud
for
three
weeks
things
always
happen
so
i
kept
secluded
and
watched
the
weather
clarence
dropped
in
from
time
to
time
and
said
the
public
excitement
was
growing
and
growing
all
the
time
and
the
whole
country
filling
up
with
human
masses
as
far
as
one
could
see
from
the
battlements
at
last
the
wind
sprang
up
and
a
cloud
appeared
in
the
right
quarter
too
and
just
at
nightfall
for
a
little
while
i
watched
that
distant
cloud
spread
and
blacken
then
i
judged
it
was
time
for
me
to
appear
i
ordered
the
torch
baskets
to
be
lit
and
merlin
liberated
and
sent
to
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
i
ascended
the
parapet
and
there
found
the
king
and
the
court
assembled
and
gazing
off
in
the
darkness
toward
merlin
s
tower
already
the
darkness
was
so
heavy
that
one
could
not
see
far
these
people
and
the
old
turrets
being
partly
in
deep
shadow
and
partly
in
the
red
glow
from
the
great
torch
baskets
overhead
made
a
good
deal
of
a
picture
merlin
arrived
in
a
gloomy
mood
i
said
you
wanted
to
burn
me
alive
when
i
had
not
done
you
any
harm
and
latterly
you
have
been
trying
to
injure
my
professional
reputation
therefore
i
am
going
to
call
down
fire
and
blow
up
your
tower
but
it
is
only
fair
to
give
you
a
chance
now
if
you
think
you
can
break
my
enchantments
and
ward
off
the
fires
step
to
the
bat
it
s
your
innings
i
can
fair
sir
and
i
will
doubt
it
not
he
drew
an
imaginary
circle
on
the
stones
of
the
roof
and
burnt
a
pinch
of
powder
in
it
which
sent
up
a
small
cloud
of
aromatic
smoke
whereat
everybody
fell
back
and
began
to
cross
themselves
and
get
uncomfortable
then
he
began
to
mutter
and
make
passes
in
the
air
with
his
hands
he
worked
himself
up
slowly
and
gradually
into
a
sort
of
frenzy
and
got
to
thrashing
around
with
his
arms
like
the
sails
of
a
windmill
by
this
time
the
storm
had
about
reached
us
the
gusts
of
wind
were
flaring
the
torches
and
making
the
shadows
swash
about
the
first
heavy
drops
of
rain
were
falling
the
world
abroad
was
black
as
pitch
the
lightning
began
to
wink
fitfully
of
course
my
rod
would
be
loading
itself
now
in
fact
things
were
imminent
so
i
said
you
have
had
time
enough
i
have
given
you
every
advantage
and
not
interfered
it
is
plain
your
magic
is
weak
it
is
only
fair
that
i
begin
now
i
made
about
three
passes
in
the
air
and
then
there
was
an
awful
crash
and
that
old
tower
leaped
into
the
sky
in
chunks
along
with
a
vast
volcanic
fountain
of
fire
that
turned
night
to
noonday
and
showed
a
thousand
acres
of
human
beings
groveling
on
the
ground
in
a
general
collapse
of
consternation
well
it
rained
mortar
and
masonry
the
rest
of
the
week
this
was
the
report
but
probably
the
facts
would
have
modified
it
it
was
an
effective
miracle
the
great
bothersome
temporary
population
vanished
there
were
a
good
many
thousand
tracks
in
the
mud
the
next
morning
but
they
were
all
outward
bound
if
i
had
advertised
another
miracle
i
couldn
t
have
raised
an
audience
with
a
sheriff
merlin
s
stock
was
flat
the
king
wanted
to
stop
his
wages
he
even
wanted
to
banish
him
but
i
interfered
i
said
he
would
be
useful
to
work
the
weather
and
attend
to
small
matters
like
that
and
i
would
give
him
a
lift
now
and
then
when
his
poor
little
parlor
magic
soured
on
him
there
wasn
t
a
rag
of
his
tower
left
but
i
had
the
government
rebuild
it
for
him
and
advised
him
to
take
boarders
but
he
was
too
high
toned
for
that
and
as
for
being
grateful
he
never
even
said
thank
you
he
was
a
rather
hard
lot
take
him
how
you
might
but
then
you
couldn
t
fairly
expect
a
man
to
be
sweet
that
had
been
set
back
so
chapter
viii
the
boss
to
be
vested
with
enormous
authority
is
a
fine
thing
but
to
have
the
on
looking
world
consent
to
it
is
a
finer
the
tower
episode
solidified
my
power
and
made
it
impregnable
if
any
were
perchance
disposed
to
be
jealous
and
critical
before
that
they
experienced
a
change
of
heart
now
there
was
not
any
one
in
the
kingdom
who
would
have
considered
it
good
judgment
to
meddle
with
my
matters
i
was
fast
getting
adjusted
to
my
situation
and
circumstances
for
a
time
i
used
to
wake
up
mornings
and
smile
at
my
dream
and
listen
for
the
colt
s
factory
whistle
but
that
sort
of
thing
played
itself
out
gradually
and
at
last
i
was
fully
able
to
realize
that
i
was
actually
living
in
the
sixth
century
and
in
arthur
s
court
not
a
lunatic
asylum
after
that
i
was
just
as
much
at
home
in
that
century
as
i
could
have
been
in
any
other
and
as
for
preference
i
wouldn
t
have
traded
it
for
the
twentieth
look
at
the
opportunities
here
for
a
man
of
knowledge
brains
pluck
and
enterprise
to
sail
in
and
grow
up
with
the
country
the
grandest
field
that
ever
was
and
all
my
own
not
a
competitor
not
a
man
who
wasn
t
a
baby
to
me
in
acquirements
and
capacities
whereas
what
would
i
amount
to
in
the
twentieth
century
i
should
be
foreman
of
a
factory
that
is
about
all
and
could
drag
a
seine
down
street
any
day
and
catch
a
hundred
better
men
than
myself
what
a
jump
i
had
made
i
couldn
t
keep
from
thinking
about
it
and
contemplating
it
just
as
one
does
who
has
struck
oil
there
was
nothing
back
of
me
that
could
approach
it
unless
it
might
be
joseph
s
case
and
joseph
s
only
approached
it
it
didn
t
equal
it
quite
for
it
stands
to
reason
that
as
joseph
s
splendid
financial
ingenuities
advantaged
nobody
but
the
king
the
general
public
must
have
regarded
him
with
a
good
deal
of
disfavor
whereas
i
had
done
my
entire
public
a
kindness
in
sparing
the
sun
and
was
popular
by
reason
of
it
i
was
no
shadow
of
a
king
i
was
the
substance
the
king
himself
was
the
shadow
my
power
was
colossal
and
it
was
not
a
mere
name
as
such
things
have
generally
been
it
was
the
genuine
article
i
stood
here
at
the
very
spring
and
source
of
the
second
great
period
of
the
world
s
history
and
could
see
the
trickling
stream
of
that
history
gather
and
deepen
and
broaden
and
roll
its
mighty
tides
down
the
far
centuries
and
i
could
note
the
upspringing
of
adventurers
like
myself
in
the
shelter
of
its
long
array
of
thrones
de
montforts
gavestons
mortimers
villierses
the
war
making
campaign
directing
wantons
of
france
and
charles
the
second
s
scepter
wielding
drabs
but
nowhere
in
the
procession
was
my
full
sized
fellow
visible
i
was
a
unique
and
glad
to
know
that
that
fact
could
not
be
dislodged
or
challenged
for
thirteen
centuries
and
a
half
for
sure
yes
in
power
i
was
equal
to
the
king
at
the
same
time
there
was
another
power
that
was
a
trifle
stronger
than
both
of
us
put
together
that
was
the
church
i
do
not
wish
to
disguise
that
fact
i
couldn
t
if
i
wanted
to
but
never
mind
about
that
now
it
will
show
up
in
its
proper
place
later
on
it
didn
t
cause
me
any
trouble
in
the
beginning
at
least
any
of
consequence
well
it
was
a
curious
country
and
full
of
interest
and
the
people
they
were
the
quaintest
and
simplest
and
trustingest
race
why
they
were
nothing
but
rabbits
it
was
pitiful
for
a
person
born
in
a
wholesome
free
atmosphere
to
listen
to
their
humble
and
hearty
outpourings
of
loyalty
toward
their
king
and
church
and
nobility
as
if
they
had
any
more
occasion
to
love
and
honor
king
and
church
and
noble
than
a
slave
has
to
love
and
honor
the
lash
or
a
dog
has
to
love
and
honor
the
stranger
that
kicks
him
why
dear
me
any
kind
of
royalty
howsoever
modified
any
kind
of
aristocracy
howsoever
pruned
is
rightly
an
insult
but
if
you
are
born
and
brought
up
under
that
sort
of
arrangement
you
probably
never
find
it
out
for
yourself
and
don
t
believe
it
when
somebody
else
tells
you
it
is
enough
to
make
a
body
ashamed
of
his
race
to
think
of
the
sort
of
froth
that
has
always
occupied
its
thrones
without
shadow
of
right
or
reason
and
the
seventh
rate
people
that
have
always
figured
as
its
aristocracies
a
company
of
monarchs
and
nobles
who
as
a
rule
would
have
achieved
only
poverty
and
obscurity
if
left
like
their
betters
to
their
own
exertions
the
most
of
king
arthur
s
british
nation
were
slaves
pure
and
simple
and
bore
that
name
and
wore
the
iron
collar
on
their
necks
and
the
rest
were
slaves
in
fact
but
without
the
name
they
imagined
themselves
men
and
freemen
and
called
themselves
so
the
truth
was
the
nation
as
a
body
was
in
the
world
for
one
object
and
one
only
to
grovel
before
king
and
church
and
noble
to
slave
for
them
sweat
blood
for
them
starve
that
they
might
be
fed
work
that
they
might
play
drink
misery
to
the
dregs
that
they
might
be
happy
go
naked
that
they
might
wear
silks
and
jewels
pay
taxes
that
they
might
be
spared
from
paying
them
be
familiar
all
their
lives
with
the
degrading
language
and
postures
of
adulation
that
they
might
walk
in
pride
and
think
themselves
the
gods
of
this
world
and
for
all
this
the
thanks
they
got
were
cuffs
and
contempt
and
so
poor
spirited
were
they
that
they
took
even
this
sort
of
attention
as
an
honor
inherited
ideas
are
a
curious
thing
and
interesting
to
observe
and
examine
i
had
mine
the
king
and
his
people
had
theirs
in
both
cases
they
flowed
in
ruts
worn
deep
by
time
and
habit
and
the
man
who
should
have
proposed
to
divert
them
by
reason
and
argument
would
have
had
a
long
contract
on
his
hands
for
instance
those
people
had
inherited
the
idea
that
all
men
without
title
and
a
long
pedigree
whether
they
had
great
natural
gifts
and
acquirements
or
hadn
t
were
creatures
of
no
more
consideration
than
so
many
animals
bugs
insects
whereas
i
had
inherited
the
idea
that
human
daws
who
can
consent
to
masquerade
in
the
peacock
shams
of
inherited
dignities
and
unearned
titles
are
of
no
good
but
to
be
laughed
at
the
way
i
was
looked
upon
was
odd
but
it
was
natural
you
know
how
the
keeper
and
the
public
regard
the
elephant
in
the
menagerie
well
that
is
the
idea
they
are
full
of
admiration
of
his
vast
bulk
and
his
prodigious
strength
they
speak
with
pride
of
the
fact
that
he
can
do
a
hundred
marvels
which
are
far
and
away
beyond
their
own
powers
and
they
speak
with
the
same
pride
of
the
fact
that
in
his
wrath
he
is
able
to
drive
a
thousand
men
before
him
but
does
that
make
him
one
of
them
no
the
raggedest
tramp
in
the
pit
would
smile
at
the
idea
he
couldn
t
comprehend
it
couldn
t
take
it
in
couldn
t
in
any
remote
way
conceive
of
it
well
to
the
king
the
nobles
and
all
the
nation
down
to
the
very
slaves
and
tramps
i
was
just
that
kind
of
an
elephant
and
nothing
more
i
was
admired
also
feared
but
it
was
as
an
animal
is
admired
and
feared
the
animal
is
not
reverenced
neither
was
i
i
was
not
even
respected
i
had
no
pedigree
no
inherited
title
so
in
the
king
s
and
nobles
eyes
i
was
mere
dirt
the
people
regarded
me
with
wonder
and
awe
but
there
was
no
reverence
mixed
with
it
through
the
force
of
inherited
ideas
they
were
not
able
to
conceive
of
anything
being
entitled
to
that
except
pedigree
and
lordship
there
you
see
the
hand
of
that
awful
power
the
roman
catholic
church
in
two
or
three
little
centuries
it
had
converted
a
nation
of
men
to
a
nation
of
worms
before
the
day
of
the
church
s
supremacy
in
the
world
men
were
men
and
held
their
heads
up
and
had
a
man
s
pride
and
spirit
and
independence
and
what
of
greatness
and
position
a
person
got
he
got
mainly
by
achievement
not
by
birth
but
then
the
church
came
to
the
front
with
an
axe
to
grind
and
she
was
wise
subtle
and
knew
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat
or
a
nation
she
invented
divine
right
of
kings
and
propped
it
all
around
brick
by
brick
with
the
beatitudes
wrenching
them
from
their
good
purpose
to
make
them
fortify
an
evil
one
she
preached
to
the
commoner
humility
obedience
to
superiors
the
beauty
of
self
sacrifice
she
preached
to
the
commoner
meekness
under
insult
preached
still
to
the
commoner
always
to
the
commoner
patience
meanness
of
spirit
non
resistance
under
oppression
and
she
introduced
heritable
ranks
and
aristocracies
and
taught
all
the
christian
populations
of
the
earth
to
bow
down
to
them
and
worship
them
even
down
to
my
birth
century
that
poison
was
still
in
the
blood
of
christendom
and
the
best
of
english
commoners
was
still
content
to
see
his
inferiors
impudently
continuing
to
hold
a
number
of
positions
such
as
lordships
and
the
throne
to
which
the
grotesque
laws
of
his
country
did
not
allow
him
to
aspire
in
fact
he
was
not
merely
contented
with
this
strange
condition
of
things
he
was
even
able
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
proud
of
it
it
seems
to
show
that
there
isn
t
anything
you
can
t
stand
if
you
are
only
born
and
bred
to
it
of
course
that
taint
that
reverence
for
rank
and
title
had
been
in
our
american
blood
too
i
know
that
but
when
i
left
america
it
had
disappeared
at
least
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
remnant
of
it
was
restricted
to
the
dudes
and
dudesses
when
a
disease
has
worked
its
way
down
to
that
level
it
may
fairly
be
said
to
be
out
of
the
system
but
to
return
to
my
anomalous
position
in
king
arthur
s
kingdom
here
i
was
a
giant
among
pigmies
a
man
among
children
a
master
intelligence
among
intellectual
moles
by
all
rational
measurement
the
one
and
only
actually
great
man
in
that
whole
british
world
and
yet
there
and
then
just
as
in
the
remote
england
of
my
birth
time
the
sheep
witted
earl
who
could
claim
long
descent
from
a
king
s
leman
acquired
at
second
hand
from
the
slums
of
london
was
a
better
man
than
i
was
such
a
personage
was
fawned
upon
in
arthur
s
realm
and
reverently
looked
up
to
by
everybody
even
though
his
dispositions
were
as
mean
as
his
intelligence
and
his
morals
as
base
as
his
lineage
there
were
times
when
he
could
sit
down
in
the
king
s
presence
but
i
couldn
t
i
could
have
got
a
title
easily
enough
and
that
would
have
raised
me
a
large
step
in
everybody
s
eyes
even
in
the
king
s
the
giver
of
it
but
i
didn
t
ask
for
it
and
i
declined
it
when
it
was
offered
i
couldn
t
have
enjoyed
such
a
thing
with
my
notions
and
it
wouldn
t
have
been
fair
anyway
because
as
far
back
as
i
could
go
our
tribe
had
always
been
short
of
the
bar
sinister
i
couldn
t
have
felt
really
and
satisfactorily
fine
and
proud
and
set
up
over
any
title
except
one
that
should
come
from
the
nation
itself
the
only
legitimate
source
and
such
an
one
i
hoped
to
win
and
in
the
course
of
years
of
honest
and
honorable
endeavor
i
did
win
it
and
did
wear
it
with
a
high
and
clean
pride
this
title
fell
casually
from
the
lips
of
a
blacksmith
one
day
in
a
village
was
caught
up
as
a
happy
thought
and
tossed
from
mouth
to
mouth
with
a
laugh
and
an
affirmative
vote
in
ten
days
it
had
swept
the
kingdom
and
was
become
as
familiar
as
the
king
s
name
i
was
never
known
by
any
other
designation
afterward
whether
in
the
nation
s
talk
or
in
grave
debate
upon
matters
of
state
at
the
council
board
of
the
sovereign
this
title
translated
into
modern
speech
would
be
the
boss
elected
by
the
nation
that
suited
me
and
it
was
a
pretty
high
title
there
were
very
few
the
s
and
i
was
one
of
them
if
you
spoke
of
the
duke
or
the
earl
or
the
bishop
how
could
anybody
tell
which
one
you
meant
but
if
you
spoke
of
the
king
or
the
queen
or
the
boss
it
was
different
well
i
liked
the
king
and
as
king
i
respected
him
respected
the
office
at
least
respected
it
as
much
as
i
was
capable
of
respecting
any
unearned
supremacy
but
as
men
i
looked
down
upon
him
and
his
nobles
privately
and
he
and
they
liked
me
and
respected
my
office
but
as
an
animal
without
birth
or
sham
title
they
looked
down
upon
me
and
were
not
particularly
private
about
it
either
i
didn
t
charge
for
my
opinion
about
them
and
they
didn
t
charge
for
their
opinion
about
me
the
account
was
square
the
books
balanced
everybody
was
satisfied
chapter
ix
the
tournament
they
were
always
having
grand
tournaments
there
at
camelot
and
very
stirring
and
picturesque
and
ridiculous
human
bull
fights
they
were
too
but
just
a
little
wearisome
to
the
practical
mind
however
i
was
generally
on
hand
for
two
reasons
a
man
must
not
hold
himself
aloof
from
the
things
which
his
friends
and
his
community
have
at
heart
if
he
would
be
liked
especially
as
a
statesman
and
both
as
business
man
and
statesman
i
wanted
to
study
the
tournament
and
see
if
i
couldn
t
invent
an
improvement
on
it
that
reminds
me
to
remark
in
passing
that
the
very
first
official
thing
i
did
in
my
administration
and
it
was
on
the
very
first
day
of
it
too
was
to
start
a
patent
office
for
i
knew
that
a
country
without
a
patent
office
and
good
patent
laws
was
just
a
crab
and
couldn
t
travel
any
way
but
sideways
or
backways
things
ran
along
a
tournament
nearly
every
week
and
now
and
then
the
boys
used
to
want
me
to
take
a
hand
i
mean
sir
launcelot
and
the
rest
but
i
said
i
would
by
and
by
no
hurry
yet
and
too
much
government
machinery
to
oil
up
and
set
to
rights
and
start
a
going
we
had
one
tournament
which
was
continued
from
day
to
day
during
more
than
a
week
and
as
many
as
five
hundred
knights
took
part
in
it
from
first
to
last
they
were
weeks
gathering
they
came
on
horseback
from
everywhere
from
the
very
ends
of
the
country
and
even
from
beyond
the
sea
and
many
brought
ladies
and
all
brought
squires
and
troops
of
servants
it
was
a
most
gaudy
and
gorgeous
crowd
as
to
costumery
and
very
characteristic
of
the
country
and
the
time
in
the
way
of
high
animal
spirits
innocent
indecencies
of
language
and
happy
hearted
indifference
to
morals
it
was
fight
or
look
on
all
day
and
every
day
and
sing
gamble
dance
carouse
half
the
night
every
night
they
had
a
most
noble
good
time
you
never
saw
such
people
those
banks
of
beautiful
ladies
shining
in
their
barbaric
splendors
would
see
a
knight
sprawl
from
his
horse
in
the
lists
with
a
lanceshaft
the
thickness
of
your
ankle
clean
through
him
and
the
blood
spouting
and
instead
of
fainting
they
would
clap
their
hands
and
crowd
each
other
for
a
better
view
only
sometimes
one
would
dive
into
her
handkerchief
and
look
ostentatiously
broken
hearted
and
then
you
could
lay
two
to
one
that
there
was
a
scandal
there
somewhere
and
she
was
afraid
the
public
hadn
t
found
it
out
the
noise
at
night
would
have
been
annoying
to
me
ordinarily
but
i
didn
t
mind
it
in
the
present
circumstances
because
it
kept
me
from
hearing
the
quacks
detaching
legs
and
arms
from
the
day
s
cripples
they
ruined
an
uncommon
good
old
cross
cut
saw
for
me
and
broke
the
saw
buck
too
but
i
let
it
pass
and
as
for
my
axe
well
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
next
time
i
lent
an
axe
to
a
surgeon
i
would
pick
my
century
i
not
only
watched
this
tournament
from
day
to
day
but
detailed
an
intelligent
priest
from
my
department
of
public
morals
and
agriculture
and
ordered
him
to
report
it
for
it
was
my
purpose
by
and
by
when
i
should
have
gotten
the
people
along
far
enough
to
start
a
newspaper
the
first
thing
you
want
in
a
new
country
is
a
patent
office
then
work
up
your
school
system
and
after
that
out
with
your
paper
a
newspaper
has
its
faults
and
plenty
of
them
but
no
matter
it
s
hark
from
the
tomb
for
a
dead
nation
and
don
t
you
forget
it
you
can
t
resurrect
a
dead
nation
without
it
there
isn
t
any
way
so
i
wanted
to
sample
things
and
be
finding
out
what
sort
of
reporter
material
i
might
be
able
to
rake
together
out
of
the
sixth
century
when
i
should
come
to
need
it
well
the
priest
did
very
well
considering
he
got
in
all
the
details
and
that
is
a
good
thing
in
a
local
item
you
see
he
had
kept
books
for
the
undertaker
department
of
his
church
when
he
was
younger
and
there
you
know
the
money
s
in
the
details
the
more
details
the
more
swag
bearers
mutes
candles
prayers
everything
counts
and
if
the
bereaved
don
t
buy
prayers
enough
you
mark
up
your
candles
with
a
forked
pencil
and
your
bill
shows
up
all
right
and
he
had
a
good
knack
at
getting
in
the
complimentary
thing
here
and
there
about
a
knight
that
was
likely
to
advertise
no
i
mean
a
knight
that
had
influence
and
he
also
had
a
neat
gift
of
exaggeration
for
in
his
time
he
had
kept
door
for
a
pious
hermit
who
lived
in
a
sty
and
worked
miracles
of
course
this
novice
s
report
lacked
whoop
and
crash
and
lurid
description
and
therefore
wanted
the
true
ring
but
its
antique
wording
was
quaint
and
sweet
and
simple
and
full
of
the
fragrances
and
flavors
of
the
time
and
these
little
merits
made
up
in
a
measure
for
its
more
important
lacks
here
is
an
extract
from
it
then
sir
brian
de
les
isles
and
grummore
grummorsum
knights
of
the
castle
encountered
with
sir
aglovale
and
sir
tor
and
sir
tor
smote
down
sir
grummore
grummorsum
to
the
earth
then
came
sir
carados
of
the
dolorous
tower
and
sir
turquine
knights
of
the
castle
and
there
encountered
with
them
sir
percivale
de
galis
and
sir
lamorak
de
galis
that
were
two
brethren
and
there
encountered
sir
percivale
with
sir
carados
and
either
brake
their
spears
unto
their
hands
and
then
sir
turquine
with
sir
lamorak
and
either
of
them
smote
down
other
horse
and
all
to
the
earth
and
either
parties
rescued
other
and
horsed
them
again
and
sir
arnold
and
sir
gauter
knights
of
the
castle
encountered
with
sir
brandiles
and
sir
kay
and
these
four
knights
encountered
mightily
and
brake
their
spears
to
their
hands
then
came
sir
pertolope
from
the
castle
and
there
encountered
with
him
sir
lionel
and
there
sir
pertolope
the
green
knight
smote
down
sir
lionel
brother
to
sir
launcelot
all
this
was
marked
by
noble
heralds
who
bare
him
best
and
their
names
then
sir
bleobaris
brake
his
spear
upon
sir
gareth
but
of
that
stroke
sir
bleobaris
fell
to
the
earth
when
sir
galihodin
saw
that
he
bad
sir
gareth
keep
him
and
sir
gareth
smote
him
to
the
earth
then
sir
galihud
gat
a
spear
to
avenge
his
brother
and
in
the
same
wise
sir
gareth
served
him
and
sir
dinadan
and
his
brother
la
cote
male
taile
and
sir
sagramore
le
disirous
and
sir
dodinas
le
savage
all
these
he
bare
down
with
one
spear
when
king
aswisance
of
ireland
saw
sir
gareth
fare
so
he
marvelled
what
he
might
be
that
one
time
seemed
green
and
another
time
at
his
again
coming
he
seemed
blue
and
thus
at
every
course
that
he
rode
to
and
fro
he
changed
his
color
so
that
there
might
neither
king
nor
knight
have
ready
cognizance
of
him
then
sir
agwisance
the
king
of
ireland
encountered
with
sir
gareth
and
there
sir
gareth
smote
him
from
his
horse
saddle
and
all
and
then
came
king
carados
of
scotland
and
sir
gareth
smote
him
down
horse
and
man
and
in
the
same
wise
he
served
king
uriens
of
the
land
of
gore
and
then
there
came
in
sir
bagdemagus
and
sir
gareth
smote
him
down
horse
and
man
to
the
earth
and
bagdemagus
s
son
meliganus
brake
a
spear
upon
sir
gareth
mightily
and
knightly
and
then
sir
galahault
the
noble
prince
cried
on
high
knight
with
the
many
colors
well
hast
thou
justed
now
make
thee
ready
that
i
may
just
with
thee
sir
gareth
heard
him
and
he
gat
a
great
spear
and
so
they
encountered
together
and
there
the
prince
brake
his
spear
but
sir
gareth
smote
him
upon
the
left
side
of
the
helm
that
he
reeled
here
and
there
and
he
had
fallen
down
had
not
his
men
recovered
him
truly
said
king
arthur
that
knight
with
the
many
colors
is
a
good
knight
wherefore
the
king
called
unto
him
sir
launcelot
and
prayed
him
to
encounter
with
that
knight
sir
said
launcelot
i
may
as
well
find
in
my
heart
for
to
forbear
him
at
this
time
for
he
hath
had
travail
enough
this
day
and
when
a
good
knight
doth
so
well
upon
some
day
it
is
no
good
knight
s
part
to
let
him
of
his
worship
and
namely
when
he
seeth
a
knight
hath
done
so
great
labour
for
peradventure
said
sir
launcelot
his
quarrel
is
here
this
day
and
peradventure
he
is
best
beloved
with
this
lady
of
all
that
be
here
for
i
see
well
he
paineth
himself
and
enforceth
him
to
do
great
deeds
and
therefore
said
sir
launcelot
as
for
me
this
day
he
shall
have
the
honour
though
it
lay
in
my
power
to
put
him
from
it
i
would
not
there
was
an
unpleasant
little
episode
that
day
which
for
reasons
of
state
i
struck
out
of
my
priest
s
report
you
will
have
noticed
that
garry
was
doing
some
great
fighting
in
the
engagement
when
i
say
garry
i
mean
sir
gareth
garry
was
my
private
pet
name
for
him
it
suggests
that
i
had
a
deep
affection
for
him
and
that
was
the
case
but
it
was
a
private
pet
name
only
and
never
spoken
aloud
to
any
one
much
less
to
him
being
a
noble
he
would
not
have
endured
a
familiarity
like
that
from
me
well
to
proceed
i
sat
in
the
private
box
set
apart
for
me
as
the
king
s
minister
while
sir
dinadan
was
waiting
for
his
turn
to
enter
the
lists
he
came
in
there
and
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
for
he
was
always
making
up
to
me
because
i
was
a
stranger
and
he
liked
to
have
a
fresh
market
for
his
jokes
the
most
of
them
having
reached
that
stage
of
wear
where
the
teller
has
to
do
the
laughing
himself
while
the
other
person
looks
sick
i
had
always
responded
to
his
efforts
as
well
as
i
could
and
felt
a
very
deep
and
real
kindness
for
him
too
for
the
reason
that
if
by
malice
of
fate
he
knew
the
one
particular
anecdote
which
i
had
heard
oftenest
and
had
most
hated
and
most
loathed
all
my
life
he
had
at
least
spared
it
me
it
was
one
which
i
had
heard
attributed
to
every
humorous
person
who
had
ever
stood
on
american
soil
from
columbus
down
to
artemus
ward
it
was
about
a
humorous
lecturer
who
flooded
an
ignorant
audience
with
the
killingest
jokes
for
an
hour
and
never
got
a
laugh
and
then
when
he
was
leaving
some
gray
simpletons
wrung
him
gratefully
by
the
hand
and
said
it
had
been
the
funniest
thing
they
had
ever
heard
and
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
keep
from
laughin
right
out
in
meetin
that
anecdote
never
saw
the
day
that
it
was
worth
the
telling
and
yet
i
had
sat
under
the
telling
of
it
hundreds
and
thousands
and
millions
and
billions
of
times
and
cried
and
cursed
all
the
way
through
then
who
can
hope
to
know
what
my
feelings
were
to
hear
this
armor
plated
ass
start
in
on
it
again
in
the
murky
twilight
of
tradition
before
the
dawn
of
history
while
even
lactantius
might
be
referred
to
as
the
late
lactantius
and
the
crusades
wouldn
t
be
born
for
five
hundred
years
yet
just
as
he
finished
the
call
boy
came
so
haw
hawing
like
a
demon
he
went
rattling
and
clanking
out
like
a
crate
of
loose
castings
and
i
knew
nothing
more
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
came
to
and
then
i
opened
my
eyes
just
in
time
to
see
sir
gareth
fetch
him
an
awful
welt
and
i
unconsciously
out
with
the
prayer
i
hope
to
gracious
he
s
killed
but
by
ill
luck
before
i
had
got
half
through
with
the
words
sir
gareth
crashed
into
sir
sagramor
le
desirous
and
sent
him
thundering
over
his
horse
s
crupper
and
sir
sagramor
caught
my
remark
and
thought
i
meant
it
for
him
well
whenever
one
of
those
people
got
a
thing
into
his
head
there
was
no
getting
it
out
again
i
knew
that
so
i
saved
my
breath
and
offered
no
explanations
as
soon
as
sir
sagramor
got
well
he
notified
me
that
there
was
a
little
account
to
settle
between
us
and
he
named
a
day
three
or
four
years
in
the
future
place
of
settlement
the
lists
where
the
offense
had
been
given
i
said
i
would
be
ready
when
he
got
back
you
see
he
was
going
for
the
holy
grail
the
boys
all
took
a
flier
at
the
holy
grail
now
and
then
it
was
a
several
years
cruise
they
always
put
in
the
long
absence
snooping
around
in
the
most
conscientious
way
though
none
of
them
had
any
idea
where
the
holy
grail
really
was
and
i
don
t
think
any
of
them
actually
expected
to
find
it
or
would
have
known
what
to
do
with
it
if
he
had
run
across
it
you
see
it
was
just
the
northwest
passage
of
that
day
as
you
may
say
that
was
all
every
year
expeditions
went
out
holy
grailing
and
next
year
relief
expeditions
went
out
to
hunt
for
them
there
was
worlds
of
reputation
in
it
but
no
money
why
they
actually
wanted
me
to
put
in
well
i
should
smile
chapter
x
beginnings
of
civilization
the
round
table
soon
heard
of
the
challenge
and
of
course
it
was
a
good
deal
discussed
for
such
things
interested
the
boys
the
king
thought
i
ought
now
to
set
forth
in
quest
of
adventures
so
that
i
might
gain
renown
and
be
the
more
worthy
to
meet
sir
sagramor
when
the
several
years
should
have
rolled
away
i
excused
myself
for
the
present
i
said
it
would
take
me
three
or
four
years
yet
to
get
things
well
fixed
up
and
going
smoothly
then
i
should
be
ready
all
the
chances
were
that
at
the
end
of
that
time
sir
sagramor
would
still
be
out
grailing
so
no
valuable
time
would
be
lost
by
the
postponement
i
should
then
have
been
in
office
six
or
seven
years
and
i
believed
my
system
and
machinery
would
be
so
well
developed
that
i
could
take
a
holiday
without
its
working
any
harm
i
was
pretty
well
satisfied
with
what
i
had
already
accomplished
in
various
quiet
nooks
and
corners
i
had
the
beginnings
of
all
sorts
of
industries
under
way
nuclei
of
future
vast
factories
the
iron
and
steel
missionaries
of
my
future
civilization
in
these
were
gathered
together
the
brightest
young
minds
i
could
find
and
i
kept
agents
out
raking
the
country
for
more
all
the
time
i
was
training
a
crowd
of
ignorant
folk
into
experts
experts
in
every
sort
of
handiwork
and
scientific
calling
these
nurseries
of
mine
went
smoothly
and
privately
along
undisturbed
in
their
obscure
country
retreats
for
nobody
was
allowed
to
come
into
their
precincts
without
a
special
permit
for
i
was
afraid
of
the
church
i
had
started
a
teacher
factory
and
a
lot
of
sunday
schools
the
first
thing
as
a
result
i
now
had
an
admirable
system
of
graded
schools
in
full
blast
in
those
places
and
also
a
complete
variety
of
protestant
congregations
all
in
a
prosperous
and
growing
condition
everybody
could
be
any
kind
of
a
christian
he
wanted
to
there
was
perfect
freedom
in
that
matter
but
i
confined
public
religious
teaching
to
the
churches
and
the
sunday
schools
permitting
nothing
of
it
in
my
other
educational
buildings
i
could
have
given
my
own
sect
the
preference
and
made
everybody
a
presbyterian
without
any
trouble
but
that
would
have
been
to
affront
a
law
of
human
nature
spiritual
wants
and
instincts
are
as
various
in
the
human
family
as
are
physical
appetites
complexions
and
features
and
a
man
is
only
at
his
best
morally
when
he
is
equipped
with
the
religious
garment
whose
color
and
shape
and
size
most
nicely
accommodate
themselves
to
the
spiritual
complexion
angularities
and
stature
of
the
individual
who
wears
it
and
besides
i
was
afraid
of
a
united
church
it
makes
a
mighty
power
the
mightiest
conceivable
and
then
when
it
by
and
by
gets
into
selfish
hands
as
it
is
always
bound
to
do
it
means
death
to
human
liberty
and
paralysis
to
human
thought
all
mines
were
royal
property
and
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
they
had
formerly
been
worked
as
savages
always
work
mines
holes
grubbed
in
the
earth
and
the
mineral
brought
up
in
sacks
of
hide
by
hand
at
the
rate
of
a
ton
a
day
but
i
had
begun
to
put
the
mining
on
a
scientific
basis
as
early
as
i
could
yes
i
had
made
pretty
handsome
progress
when
sir
sagramor
s
challenge
struck
me
four
years
rolled
by
and
then
well
you
would
never
imagine
it
in
the
world
unlimited
power
is
the
ideal
thing
when
it
is
in
safe
hands
the
despotism
of
heaven
is
the
one
absolutely
perfect
government
an
earthly
despotism
would
be
the
absolutely
perfect
earthly
government
if
the
conditions
were
the
same
namely
the
despot
the
perfectest
individual
of
the
human
race
and
his
lease
of
life
perpetual
but
as
a
perishable
perfect
man
must
die
and
leave
his
despotism
in
the
hands
of
an
imperfect
successor
an
earthly
despotism
is
not
merely
a
bad
form
of
government
it
is
the
worst
form
that
is
possible
my
works
showed
what
a
despot
could
do
with
the
resources
of
a
kingdom
at
his
command
unsuspected
by
this
dark
land
i
had
the
civilization
of
the
nineteenth
century
booming
under
its
very
nose
it
was
fenced
away
from
the
public
view
but
there
it
was
a
gigantic
and
unassailable
fact
and
to
be
heard
from
yet
if
i
lived
and
had
luck
there
it
was
as
sure
a
fact
and
as
substantial
a
fact
as
any
serene
volcano
standing
innocent
with
its
smokeless
summit
in
the
blue
sky
and
giving
no
sign
of
the
rising
hell
in
its
bowels
my
schools
and
churches
were
children
four
years
before
they
were
grown
up
now
my
shops
of
that
day
were
vast
factories
now
where
i
had
a
dozen
trained
men
then
i
had
a
thousand
now
where
i
had
one
brilliant
expert
then
i
had
fifty
now
i
stood
with
my
hand
on
the
cock
so
to
speak
ready
to
turn
it
on
and
flood
the
midnight
world
with
light
at
any
moment
but
i
was
not
going
to
do
the
thing
in
that
sudden
way
it
was
not
my
policy
the
people
could
not
have
stood
it
and
moreover
i
should
have
had
the
established
roman
catholic
church
on
my
back
in
a
minute
no
i
had
been
going
cautiously
all
the
while
i
had
had
confidential
agents
trickling
through
the
country
some
time
whose
office
was
to
undermine
knighthood
by
imperceptible
degrees
and
to
gnaw
a
little
at
this
and
that
and
the
other
superstition
and
so
prepare
the
way
gradually
for
a
better
order
of
things
i
was
turning
on
my
light
one
candle
power
at
a
time
and
meant
to
continue
to
do
so
i
had
scattered
some
branch
schools
secretly
about
the
kingdom
and
they
were
doing
very
well
i
meant
to
work
this
racket
more
and
more
as
time
wore
on
if
nothing
occurred
to
frighten
me
one
of
my
deepest
secrets
was
my
west
point
my
military
academy
i
kept
that
most
jealously
out
of
sight
and
i
did
the
same
with
my
naval
academy
which
i
had
established
at
a
remote
seaport
both
were
prospering
to
my
satisfaction
clarence
was
twenty
two
now
and
was
my
head
executive
my
right
hand
he
was
a
darling
he
was
equal
to
anything
there
wasn
t
anything
he
couldn
t
turn
his
hand
to
of
late
i
had
been
training
him
for
journalism
for
the
time
seemed
about
right
for
a
start
in
the
newspaper
line
nothing
big
but
just
a
small
weekly
for
experimental
circulation
in
my
civilization
nurseries
he
took
to
it
like
a
duck
there
was
an
editor
concealed
in
him
sure
already
he
had
doubled
himself
in
one
way
he
talked
sixth
century
and
wrote
nineteenth
his
journalistic
style
was
climbing
steadily
it
was
already
up
to
the
back
settlement
alabama
mark
and
couldn
t
be
told
from
the
editorial
output
of
that
region
either
by
matter
or
flavor
we
had
another
large
departure
on
hand
too
this
was
a
telegraph
and
a
telephone
our
first
venture
in
this
line
these
wires
were
for
private
service
only
as
yet
and
must
be
kept
private
until
a
riper
day
should
come
we
had
a
gang
of
men
on
the
road
working
mainly
by
night
they
were
stringing
ground
wires
we
were
afraid
to
put
up
poles
for
they
would
attract
too
much
inquiry
ground
wires
were
good
enough
in
both
instances
for
my
wires
were
protected
by
an
insulation
of
my
own
invention
which
was
perfect
my
men
had
orders
to
strike
across
country
avoiding
roads
and
establishing
connection
with
any
considerable
towns
whose
lights
betrayed
their
presence
and
leaving
experts
in
charge
nobody
could
tell
you
how
to
find
any
place
in
the
kingdom
for
nobody
ever
went
intentionally
to
any
place
but
only
struck
it
by
accident
in
his
wanderings
and
then
generally
left
it
without
thinking
to
inquire
what
its
name
was
at
one
time
and
another
we
had
sent
out
topographical
expeditions
to
survey
and
map
the
kingdom
but
the
priests
had
always
interfered
and
raised
trouble
so
we
had
given
the
thing
up
for
the
present
it
would
be
poor
wisdom
to
antagonize
the
church
as
for
the
general
condition
of
the
country
it
was
as
it
had
been
when
i
arrived
in
it
to
all
intents
and
purposes
i
had
made
changes
but
they
were
necessarily
slight
and
they
were
not
noticeable
thus
far
i
had
not
even
meddled
with
taxation
outside
of
the
taxes
which
provided
the
royal
revenues
i
had
systematized
those
and
put
the
service
on
an
effective
and
righteous
basis
as
a
result
these
revenues
were
already
quadrupled
and
yet
the
burden
was
so
much
more
equably
distributed
than
before
that
all
the
kingdom
felt
a
sense
of
relief
and
the
praises
of
my
administration
were
hearty
and
general
personally
i
struck
an
interruption
now
but
i
did
not
mind
it
it
could
not
have
happened
at
a
better
time
earlier
it
could
have
annoyed
me
but
now
everything
was
in
good
hands
and
swimming
right
along
the
king
had
reminded
me
several
times
of
late
that
the
postponement
i
had
asked
for
four
years
before
had
about
run
out
now
it
was
a
hint
that
i
ought
to
be
starting
out
to
seek
adventures
and
get
up
a
reputation
of
a
size
to
make
me
worthy
of
the
honor
of
breaking
a
lance
with
sir
sagramor
who
was
still
out
grailing
but
was
being
hunted
for
by
various
relief
expeditions
and
might
be
found
any
year
now
so
you
see
i
was
expecting
this
interruption
it
did
not
take
me
by
surprise
chapter
xi
the
yankee
in
search
of
adventures
there
never
was
such
a
country
for
wandering
liars
and
they
were
of
both
sexes
hardly
a
month
went
by
without
one
of
these
tramps
arriving
and
generally
loaded
with
a
tale
about
some
princess
or
other
wanting
help
to
get
her
out
of
some
far
away
castle
where
she
was
held
in
captivity
by
a
lawless
scoundrel
usually
a
giant
now
you
would
think
that
the
first
thing
the
king
would
do
after
listening
to
such
a
novelette
from
an
entire
stranger
would
be
to
ask
for
credentials
yes
and
a
pointer
or
two
as
to
locality
of
castle
best
route
to
it
and
so
on
but
nobody
ever
thought
of
so
simple
and
common
sense
a
thing
at
that
no
everybody
swallowed
these
people
s
lies
whole
and
never
asked
a
question
of
any
sort
or
about
anything
well
one
day
when
i
was
not
around
one
of
these
people
came
along
it
was
a
she
one
this
time
and
told
a
tale
of
the
usual
pattern
her
mistress
was
a
captive
in
a
vast
and
gloomy
castle
along
with
forty
four
other
young
and
beautiful
girls
pretty
much
all
of
them
princesses
they
had
been
languishing
in
that
cruel
captivity
for
twenty
six
years
the
masters
of
the
castle
were
three
stupendous
brothers
each
with
four
arms
and
one
eye
the
eye
in
the
center
of
the
forehead
and
as
big
as
a
fruit
sort
of
fruit
not
mentioned
their
usual
slovenliness
in
statistics
would
you
believe
it
the
king
and
the
whole
round
table
were
in
raptures
over
this
preposterous
opportunity
for
adventure
every
knight
of
the
table
jumped
for
the
chance
and
begged
for
it
but
to
their
vexation
and
chagrin
the
king
conferred
it
upon
me
who
had
not
asked
for
it
at
all
by
an
effort
i
contained
my
joy
when
clarence
brought
me
the
news
but
he
he
could
not
contain
his
his
mouth
gushed
delight
and
gratitude
in
a
steady
discharge
delight
in
my
good
fortune
gratitude
to
the
king
for
this
splendid
mark
of
his
favor
for
me
he
could
keep
neither
his
legs
nor
his
body
still
but
pirouetted
about
the
place
in
an
airy
ecstasy
of
happiness
on
my
side
i
could
have
cursed
the
kindness
that
conferred
upon
me
this
benefaction
but
i
kept
my
vexation
under
the
surface
for
policy
s
sake
and
did
what
i
could
to
let
on
to
be
glad
indeed
i
said
i
was
glad
and
in
a
way
it
was
true
i
was
as
glad
as
a
person
is
when
he
is
scalped
well
one
must
make
the
best
of
things
and
not
waste
time
with
useless
fretting
but
get
down
to
business
and
see
what
can
be
done
in
all
lies
there
is
wheat
among
the
chaff
i
must
get
at
the
wheat
in
this
case
so
i
sent
for
the
girl
and
she
came
she
was
a
comely
enough
creature
and
soft
and
modest
but
if
signs
went
for
anything
she
didn
t
know
as
much
as
a
lady
s
watch
i
said
my
dear
have
you
been
questioned
as
to
particulars
she
said
she
hadn
t
well
i
didn
t
expect
you
had
but
i
thought
i
would
ask
to
make
sure
it
s
the
way
i
ve
been
raised
now
you
mustn
t
take
it
unkindly
if
i
remind
you
that
as
we
don
t
know
you
we
must
go
a
little
slow
you
may
be
all
right
of
course
and
we
ll
hope
that
you
are
but
to
take
it
for
granted
isn
t
business
you
understand
that
i
m
obliged
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
just
answer
up
fair
and
square
and
don
t
be
afraid
where
do
you
live
when
you
are
at
home
in
the
land
of
moder

first
time

proofs

wherefore

cannot
i
say
all
that
myself
but
your
saying

and
somebody

how
might

i
do

why
you

so
innocent
and
idiotic
i
in
truth
i
know
not
but
an
it
were
the
will
of
god
yes
yes
i
reckon
that
s
about
the
size
of
it
don
t
mind
my
seeming
excited
i
m
not
let
us
change
the
subject
now
as
to
this
castle
with
forty
five
princesses
in
it
and
three
ogres
at
the
head
of
it
tell
me
where
is
this
harem
harem
the
castle
you
understand
where
is
the
castle
oh
as
to
that
it
is
great
and
strong
and
well
beseen
and
lieth
in
a
far
country
yes
it
is
many
leagues
how
many
ah
fair
sir
it
were
woundily
hard
to
tell
they
are
so
many
and
do
so
lap
the
one
upon
the
other
and
being
made
all
in
the
same
image
and
tincted
with
the
same
color
one
may
not
know
the
one
league
from
its
fellow
nor
how
to
count
them
except
they
be
taken
apart
and
ye
wit
well
it
were
god
s
work
to
do
that
being
not
within
man
s
capacity
for
ye
will
note
hold
on
hold
on
never
mind
about
the
distance
whereabouts
does
the
castle
lie
what
s
the
direction
from
here
ah
please
you
sir
it
hath
no
direction
from
here
by
reason
that
the
road
lieth
not
straight
but
turneth
evermore
wherefore
the
direction
of
its
place
abideth
not
but
is
some
time
under
the
one
sky
and
anon
under
another
whereso
if
ye
be
minded
that
it
is
in
the
east
and
wend
thitherward
ye
shall
observe
that
the
way
of
the
road
doth
yet
again
turn
upon
itself
by
the
space
of
half
a
circle
and
this
marvel
happing
again
and
yet
again
and
still
again
it
will
grieve
you
that
you
had
thought
by
vanities
of
the
mind
to
thwart
and
bring
to
naught
the
will
of
him
that
giveth
not
a
castle
a
direction
from
a
place
except
it
pleaseth
him
and
if
it
please
him
not
will
the
rather
that
even
all
castles
and
all
directions
thereunto
vanish
out
of
the
earth
leaving
the
places
wherein
they
tarried
desolate
and
vacant
so
warning
his
creatures
that
where
he
will
he
will
and
where
he
will
not
he
oh
that
s
all
right
that
s
all
right
give
us
a
rest
never
mind
about
the
direction
hang
the
direction
i
beg
pardon
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
am
not
well
to
day
pay
no
attention
when
i
soliloquize
it
is
an
old
habit
an
old
bad
habit
and
hard
to
get
rid
of
when
one
s
digestion
is
all
disordered
with
eating
food
that
was
raised
forever
and
ever
before
he
was
born
good
land
a
man
can
t
keep
his
functions
regular
on
spring
chickens
thirteen
hundred
years
old
but
come
never
mind
about
that
let
s
have
you
got
such
a
thing
as
a
map
of
that
region
about
you
now
a
good
map
is
it
peradventure
that
manner
of
thing
which
of
late
the
unbelievers
have
brought
from
over
the
great
seas
which
being
boiled
in
oil
and
an
onion
and
salt
added
thereto
doth
what
a
map
what
are
you
talking
about
don
t
you
know
what
a
map
is
there
there
never
mind
don
t
explain
i
hate
explanations
they
fog
a
thing
up
so
that
you
can
t
tell
anything
about
it
run
along
dear
good
day
show
her
the
way
clarence
oh
well
it
was
reasonably
plain
now
why
these
donkeys
didn
t
prospect
these
liars
for
details
it
may
be
that
this
girl
had
a
fact
in
her
somewhere
but
i
don
t
believe
you
could
have
sluiced
it
out
with
a
hydraulic
nor
got
it
with
the
earlier
forms
of
blasting
even
it
was
a
case
for
dynamite
why
she
was
a
perfect
ass
and
yet
the
king
and
his
knights
had
listened
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
leaf
out
of
the
gospel
it
kind
of
sizes
up
the
whole
party
and
think
of
the
simple
ways
of
this
court
this
wandering
wench
hadn
t
any
more
trouble
to
get
access
to
the
king
in
his
palace
than
she
would
have
had
to
get
into
the
poorhouse
in
my
day
and
country
in
fact
he
was
glad
to
see
her
glad
to
hear
her
tale
with
that
adventure
of
hers
to
offer
she
was
as
welcome
as
a
corpse
is
to
a
coroner
just
as
i
was
ending
up
these
reflections
clarence
came
back
i
remarked
upon
the
barren
result
of
my
efforts
with
the
girl
hadn
t
got
hold
of
a
single
point
that
could
help
me
to
find
the
castle
the
youth
looked
a
little
surprised
or
puzzled
or
something
and
intimated
that
he
had
been
wondering
to
himself
what
i
had
wanted
to
ask
the
girl
all
those
questions
for
why
great
guns
i
said
don
t
i
want
to
find
the
castle
and
how
else
would
i
go
about
it
la
sweet
your
worship
one
may
lightly
answer
that
i
ween
she
will
go
with
thee
they
always
do
she
will
ride
with
thee
ride
with
me
nonsense
but
of
a
truth
she
will
she
will
ride
with
thee
thou
shalt
see
what
she
browse
around
the
hills
and
scour
the
woods
with
me
alone
and
i
as
good
as
engaged
to
be
married
why
it
s
scandalous
think
how
it
would
look
my
the
dear
face
that
rose
before
me
the
boy
was
eager
to
know
all
about
this
tender
matter
i
swore
him
to
secrecy
and
then
whispered
her
name
puss
flanagan
he
looked
disappointed
and
said
he
didn
t
remember
the
countess
how
natural
it
was
for
the
little
courtier
to
give
her
a
rank
he
asked
me
where
she
lived
in
east
har
i
came
to
myself
and
stopped
a
little
confused
then
i
said
never
mind
now
i
ll
tell
you
some
time
and
might
he
see
her
would
i
let
him
see
her
some
day
it
was
but
a
little
thing
to
promise
thirteen
hundred
years
or
so
and
he
so
eager
so
i
said
yes
but
i
sighed
i
couldn
t
help
it
and
yet
there
was
no
sense
in
sighing
for
she
wasn
t
born
yet
but
that
is
the
way
we
are
made
we
don
t
reason
where
we
feel
we
just
feel
my
expedition
was
all
the
talk
that
day
and
that
night
and
the
boys
were
very
good
to
me
and
made
much
of
me
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
their
vexation
and
disappointment
and
come
to
be
as
anxious
for
me
to
hive
those
ogres
and
set
those
ripe
old
virgins
loose
as
if
it
were
themselves
that
had
the
contract
well
they
were
good
children
but
just
children
that
is
all
and
they
gave
me
no
end
of
points
about
how
to
scout
for
giants
and
how
to
scoop
them
in
and
they
told
me
all
sorts
of
charms
against
enchantments
and
gave
me
salves
and
other
rubbish
to
put
on
my
wounds
but
it
never
occurred
to
one
of
them
to
reflect
that
if
i
was
such
a
wonderful
necromancer
as
i
was
pretending
to
be
i
ought
not
to
need
salves
or
instructions
or
charms

and

of

arms
and

on
a
foray
of
any
kind
even
against
fire
spouting
dragons
and
devils
hot
from
perdition
let
alone
such
poor
adversaries
as
these
i
was
after
these
commonplace
ogres
of
the
back
settlements
i
was
to
have
an
early
breakfast
and
start
at
dawn
for
that
was
the
usual
way
but
i
had
the
demon
s
own
time
with
my
armor
and
this
delayed
me
a
little
it
is
troublesome
to
get
into
and
there
is
so
much
detail
first
you
wrap
a
layer
or
two
of
blanket
around
your
body
for
a
sort
of
cushion
and
to
keep
off
the
cold
iron
then
you
put
on
your
sleeves
and
shirt
of
chain
mail
these
are
made
of
small
steel
links
woven
together
and
they
form
a
fabric
so
flexible
that
if
you
toss
your
shirt
onto
the
floor
it
slumps
into
a
pile
like
a
peck
of
wet
fish
net
it
is
very
heavy
and
is
nearly
the
uncomfortablest
material
in
the
world
for
a
night
shirt
yet
plenty
used
it
for
that
tax
collectors
and
reformers
and
one
horse
kings
with
a
defective
title
and
those
sorts
of
people
then
you
put
on
your
shoes
flat
boats
roofed
over
with
interleaving
bands
of
steel
and
screw
your
clumsy
spurs
into
the
heels
next
you
buckle
your
greaves
on
your
legs
and
your
cuisses
on
your
thighs
then
come
your
backplate
and
your
breastplate
and
you
begin
to
feel
crowded
then
you
hitch
onto
the
breastplate
the
half
petticoat
of
broad
overlapping
bands
of
steel
which
hangs
down
in
front
but
is
scolloped
out
behind
so
you
can
sit
down
and
isn
t
any
real
improvement
on
an
inverted
coal
scuttle
either
for
looks
or
for
wear
or
to
wipe
your
hands
on
next
you
belt
on
your
sword
then
you
put
your
stove
pipe
joints
onto
your
arms
your
iron
gauntlets
onto
your
hands
your
iron
rat
trap
onto
your
head
with
a
rag
of
steel
web
hitched
onto
it
to
hang
over
the
back
of
your
neck
and
there
you
are
snug
as
a
candle
in
a
candle
mould
this
is
no
time
to
dance
well
a
man
that
is
packed
away
like
that
is
a
nut
that
isn
t
worth
the
cracking
there
is
so
little
of
the
meat
when
you
get
down
to
it
by
comparison
with
the
shell
the
boys
helped
me
or
i
never
could
have
got
in
just
as
we
finished
sir
bedivere
happened
in
and
i
saw
that
as
like
as
not
i
hadn
t
chosen
the
most
convenient
outfit
for
a
long
trip
how
stately
he
looked
and
tall
and
broad
and
grand
he
had
on
his
head
a
conical
steel
casque
that
only
came
down
to
his
ears
and
for
visor
had
only
a
narrow
steel
bar
that
extended
down
to
his
upper
lip
and
protected
his
nose
and
all
the
rest
of
him
from
neck
to
heel
was
flexible
chain
mail
trousers
and
all
but
pretty
much
all
of
him
was
hidden
under
his
outside
garment
which
of
course
was
of
chain
mail
as
i
said
and
hung
straight
from
his
shoulders
to
his
ankles
and
from
his
middle
to
the
bottom
both
before
and
behind
was
divided
so
that
he
could
ride
and
let
the
skirts
hang
down
on
each
side
he
was
going
grailing
and
it
was
just
the
outfit
for
it
too
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
that
ulster
but
it
was
too
late
now
to
be
fooling
around
the
sun
was
just
up
the
king
and
the
court
were
all
on
hand
to
see
me
off
and
wish
me
luck
so
it
wouldn
t
be
etiquette
for
me
to
tarry
you
don
t
get
on
your
horse
yourself
no
if
you
tried
it
you
would
get
disappointed
they
carry
you
out
just
as
they
carry
a
sun
struck
man
to
the
drug
store
and
put
you
on
and
help
get
you
to
rights
and
fix
your
feet
in
the
stirrups
and
all
the
while
you
do
feel
so
strange
and
stuffy
and
like
somebody
else
like
somebody
that
has
been
married
on
a
sudden
or
struck
by
lightning
or
something
like
that
and
hasn
t
quite
fetched
around
yet
and
is
sort
of
numb
and
can
t
just
get
his
bearings
then
they
stood
up
the
mast
they
called
a
spear
in
its
socket
by
my
left
foot
and
i
gripped
it
with
my
hand
lastly
they
hung
my
shield
around
my
neck
and
i
was
all
complete
and
ready
to
up
anchor
and
get
to
sea
everybody
was
as
good
to
me
as
they
could
be
and
a
maid
of
honor
gave
me
the
stirrup
cup
her
own
self
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
now
but
for
that
damsel
to
get
up
behind
me
on
a
pillion
which
she
did
and
put
an
arm
or
so
around
me
to
hold
on
and
so
we
started
and
everybody
gave
us
a
goodbye
and
waved
their
handkerchiefs
or
helmets
and
everybody
we
met
going
down
the
hill
and
through
the
village
was
respectful
to
us
except
some
shabby
little
boys
on
the
outskirts
they
said
oh
what
a
guy
and
hove
clods
at
us
in
my
experience
boys
are
the
same
in
all
ages
they
don
t
respect
anything
they
don
t
care
for
anything
or
anybody
they
say
go
up
baldhead
to
the
prophet
going
his
unoffending
way
in
the
gray
of
antiquity
they
sass
me
in
the
holy
gloom
of
the
middle
ages
and
i
had
seen
them
act
the
same
way
in
buchanan
s
administration
i
remember
because
i
was
there
and
helped
the
prophet
had
his
bears
and
settled
with
his
boys
and
i
wanted
to
get
down
and
settle
with
mine
but
it
wouldn
t
answer
because
i
couldn
t
have
got
up
again
i
hate
a
country
without
a
derrick
chapter
xii
slow
torture
straight
off
we
were
in
the
country
it
was
most
lovely
and
pleasant
in
those
sylvan
solitudes
in
the
early
cool
morning
in
the
first
freshness
of
autumn
from
hilltops
we
saw
fair
green
valleys
lying
spread
out
below
with
streams
winding
through
them
and
island
groves
of
trees
here
and
there
and
huge
lonely
oaks
scattered
about
and
casting
black
blots
of
shade
and
beyond
the
valleys
we
saw
the
ranges
of
hills
blue
with
haze
stretching
away
in
billowy
perspective
to
the
horizon
with
at
wide
intervals
a
dim
fleck
of
white
or
gray
on
a
wave
summit
which
we
knew
was
a
castle
we
crossed
broad
natural
lawns
sparkling
with
dew
and
we
moved
like
spirits
the
cushioned
turf
giving
out
no
sound
of
footfall
we
dreamed
along
through
glades
in
a
mist
of
green
light
that
got
its
tint
from
the
sun
drenched
roof
of
leaves
overhead
and
by
our
feet
the
clearest
and
coldest
of
runlets
went
frisking
and
gossiping
over
its
reefs
and
making
a
sort
of
whispering
music
comfortable
to
hear
and
at
times
we
left
the
world
behind
and
entered
into
the
solemn
great
deeps
and
rich
gloom
of
the
forest
where
furtive
wild
things
whisked
and
scurried
by
and
were
gone
before
you
could
even
get
your
eye
on
the
place
where
the
noise
was
and
where
only
the
earliest
birds
were
turning
out
and
getting
to
business
with
a
song
here
and
a
quarrel
yonder
and
a
mysterious
far
off
hammering
and
drumming
for
worms
on
a
tree
trunk
away
somewhere
in
the
impenetrable
remotenesses
of
the
woods
and
by
and
by
out
we
would
swing
again
into
the
glare
about
the
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
time
that
we
swung
out
into
the
glare
it
was
along
there
somewhere
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
after
sun
up
it
wasn
t
as
pleasant
as
it
had
been
it
was
beginning
to
get
hot
this
was
quite
noticeable
we
had
a
very
long
pull
after
that
without
any
shade
now
it
is
curious
how
progressively
little
frets
grow
and
multiply
after
they
once
get
a
start
things
which
i
didn
t
mind
at
all
at
first
i
began
to
mind
now
and
more
and
more
too
all
the
time
the
first
ten
or
fifteen
times
i
wanted
my
handkerchief
i
didn
t
seem
to
care
i
got
along
and
said
never
mind
it
isn
t
any
matter
and
dropped
it
out
of
my
mind
but
now
it
was
different
i
wanted
it
all
the
time
it
was
nag
nag
nag
right
along
and
no
rest
i
couldn
t
get
it
out
of
my
mind
and
so
at
last
i
lost
my
temper
and
said
hang
a
man
that
would
make
a
suit
of
armor
without
any
pockets
in
it
you
see
i
had
my
handkerchief
in
my
helmet
and
some
other
things
but
it
was
that
kind
of
a
helmet
that
you
can
t
take
off
by
yourself
that
hadn
t
occurred
to
me
when
i
put
it
there
and
in
fact
i
didn
t
know
it
i
supposed
it
would
be
particularly
convenient
there
and
so
now
the
thought
of
its
being
there
so
handy
and
close
by
and
yet
not
get
at
able
made
it
all
the
worse
and
the
harder
to
bear
yes
the
thing
that
you
can
t
get
is
the
thing
that
you
want
mainly
every
one
has
noticed
that
well
it
took
my
mind
off
from
everything
else
took
it
clear
off
and
centered
it
in
my
helmet
and
mile
after
mile
there
it
stayed
imagining
the
handkerchief
picturing
the
handkerchief
and
it
was
bitter
and
aggravating
to
have
the
salt
sweat
keep
trickling
down
into
my
eyes
and
i
couldn
t
get
at
it
it
seems
like
a
little
thing
on
paper
but
it
was
not
a
little
thing
at
all
it
was
the
most
real
kind
of
misery
i
would
not
say
it
if
it
was
not
so
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
carry
along
a
reticule
next
time
let
it
look
how
it
might
and
people
say
what
they
would
of
course
these
iron
dudes
of
the
round
table
would
think
it
was
scandalous
and
maybe
raise
sheol
about
it
but
as
for
me
give
me
comfort
first
and
style
afterwards
so
we
jogged
along
and
now
and
then
we
struck
a
stretch
of
dust
and
it
would
tumble
up
in
clouds
and
get
into
my
nose
and
make
me
sneeze
and
cry
and
of
course
i
said
things
i
oughtn
t
to
have
said
i
don
t
deny
that
i
am
not
better
than
others
we
couldn
t
seem
to
meet
anybody
in
this
lonesome
britain
not
even
an
ogre
and
in
the
mood
i
was
in
then
it
was
well
for
the
ogre
that
is
an
ogre
with
a
handkerchief
most
knights
would
have
thought
of
nothing
but
getting
his
armor
but
so
i
got
his
bandanna
he
could
keep
his
hardware
for
all
of
me
meantime
it
was
getting
hotter
and
hotter
in
there
you
see
the
sun
was
beating
down
and
warming
up
the
iron
more
and
more
all
the
time
well
when
you
are
hot
that
way
every
little
thing
irritates
you
when
i
trotted
i
rattled
like
a
crate
of
dishes
and
that
annoyed
me
and
moreover
i
couldn
t
seem
to
stand
that
shield
slatting
and
banging
now
about
my
breast
now
around
my
back
and
if
i
dropped
into
a
walk
my
joints
creaked
and
screeched
in
that
wearisome
way
that
a
wheelbarrow
does
and
as
we
didn
t
create
any
breeze
at
that
gait
i
was
like
to
get
fried
in
that
stove
and
besides
the
quieter
you
went
the
heavier
the
iron
settled
down
on
you
and
the
more
and
more
tons
you
seemed
to
weigh
every
minute
and
you
had
to
be
always
changing
hands
and
passing
your
spear
over
to
the
other
foot
it
got
so
irksome
for
one
hand
to
hold
it
long
at
a
time
well
you
know
when
you
perspire
that
way
in
rivers
there
comes
a
time
when
you
when
you
well
when
you
itch
you
are
inside
your
hands
are
outside
so
there
you
are
nothing
but
iron
between
it
is
not
a
light
thing
let
it
sound
as
it
may
first
it
is
one
place
then
another
then
some
more
and
it
goes
on
spreading
and
spreading
and
at
last
the
territory
is
all
occupied
and
nobody
can
imagine
what
you
feel
like
nor
how
unpleasant
it
is
and
when
it
had
got
to
the
worst
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
not
stand
anything
more
a
fly
got
in
through
the
bars
and
settled
on
my
nose
and
the
bars
were
stuck
and
wouldn
t
work
and
i
couldn
t
get
the
visor
up
and
i
could
only
shake
my
head
which
was
baking
hot
by
this
time
and
the
fly
well
you
know
how
a
fly
acts
when
he
has
got
a
certainty
he
only
minded
the
shaking
enough
to
change
from
nose
to
lip
and
lip
to
ear
and
buzz
and
buzz
all
around
in
there
and
keep
on
lighting
and
biting
in
a
way
that
a
person
already
so
distressed
as
i
was
simply
could
not
stand
so
i
gave
in
and
got
alisande
to
unship
the
helmet
and
relieve
me
of
it
then
she
emptied
the
conveniences
out
of
it
and
fetched
it
full
of
water
and
i
drank
and
then
stood
up
and
she
poured
the
rest
down
inside
the
armor
one
cannot
think
how
refreshing
it
was
she
continued
to
fetch
and
pour
until
i
was
well
soaked
and
thoroughly
comfortable
it
was
good
to
have
a
rest
and
peace
but
nothing
is
quite
perfect
in
this
life
at
any
time
i
had
made
a
pipe
a
while
back
and
also
some
pretty
fair
tobacco
not
the
real
thing
but
what
some
of
the
indians
use
the
inside
bark
of
the
willow
dried
these
comforts
had
been
in
the
helmet
and
now
i
had
them
again
but
no
matches
gradually
as
the
time
wore
along
one
annoying
fact
was
borne
in
upon
my
understanding
that
we
were
weather
bound
an
armed
novice
cannot
mount
his
horse
without
help
and
plenty
of
it
sandy
was
not
enough
not
enough
for
me
anyway
we
had
to
wait
until
somebody
should
come
along
waiting
in
silence
would
have
been
agreeable
enough
for
i
was
full
of
matter
for
reflection
and
wanted
to
give
it
a
chance
to
work
i
wanted
to
try
and
think
out
how
it
was
that
rational
or
even
half
rational
men
could
ever
have
learned
to
wear
armor
considering
its
inconveniences
and
how
they
had
managed
to
keep
up
such
a
fashion
for
generations
when
it
was
plain
that
what
i
had
suffered
to
day
they
had
had
to
suffer
all
the
days
of
their
lives
i
wanted
to
think
that
out
and
moreover
i
wanted
to
think
out
some
way
to
reform
this
evil
and
persuade
the
people
to
let
the
foolish
fashion
die
out
but
thinking
was
out
of
the
question
in
the
circumstances
you
couldn
t
think
where
sandy
was
she
was
a
quite
biddable
creature
and
good
hearted
but
she
had
a
flow
of
talk
that
was
as
steady
as
a
mill
and
made
your
head
sore
like
the
drays
and
wagons
in
a
city
if
she
had
had
a
cork
she
would
have
been
a
comfort
but
you
can
t
cork
that
kind
they
would
die
her
clack
was
going
all
day
and
you
would
think
something
would
surely
happen
to
her
works
by
and
by
but
no
they
never
got
out
of
order
and
she
never
had
to
slack
up
for
words
she
could
grind
and
pump
and
churn
and
buzz
by
the
week
and
never
stop
to
oil
up
or
blow
out
and
yet
the
result
was
just
nothing
but
wind
she
never
had
any
ideas
any
more
than
a
fog
has
she
was
a
perfect
blatherskite
i
mean
for
jaw
jaw
jaw
talk
talk
talk
jabber
jabber
jabber
but
just
as
good
as
she
could
be
i
hadn
t
minded
her
mill
that
morning
on
account
of
having
that
hornets
nest
of
other
troubles
but
more
than
once
in
the
afternoon
i
had
to
say
take
a
rest
child
the
way
you
are
using
up
all
the
domestic
air
the
kingdom
will
have
to
go
to
importing
it
by
to
morrow
and
it
s
a
low
enough
treasury
without
that
chapter
xiii
freemen
yes
it
is
strange
how
little
a
while
at
a
time
a
person
can
be
contented
only
a
little
while
back
when
i
was
riding
and
suffering
what
a
heaven
this
peace
this
rest
this
sweet
serenity
in
this
secluded
shady
nook
by
this
purling
stream
would
have
seemed
where
i
could
keep
perfectly
comfortable
all
the
time
by
pouring
a
dipper
of
water
into
my
armor
now
and
then
yet
already
i
was
getting
dissatisfied
partly
because
i
could
not
light
my
pipe
for
although
i
had
long
ago
started
a
match
factory
i
had
forgotten
to
bring
matches
with
me
and
partly
because
we
had
nothing
to
eat
here
was
another
illustration
of
the
childlike
improvidence
of
this
age
and
people
a
man
in
armor
always
trusted
to
chance
for
his
food
on
a
journey
and
would
have
been
scandalized
at
the
idea
of
hanging
a
basket
of
sandwiches
on
his
spear
there
was
probably
not
a
knight
of
all
the
round
table
combination
who
would
not
rather
have
died
than
been
caught
carrying
such
a
thing
as
that
on
his
flagstaff
and
yet
there
could
not
be
anything
more
sensible
it
had
been
my
intention
to
smuggle
a
couple
of
sandwiches
into
my
helmet
but
i
was
interrupted
in
the
act
and
had
to
make
an
excuse
and
lay
them
aside
and
a
dog
got
them
night
approached
and
with
it
a
storm
the
darkness
came
on
fast
we
must
camp
of
course
i
found
a
good
shelter
for
the
demoiselle
under
a
rock
and
went
off
and
found
another
for
myself
but
i
was
obliged
to
remain
in
my
armor
because
i
could
not
get
it
off
by
myself
and
yet
could
not
allow
alisande
to
help
because
it
would
have
seemed
so
like
undressing
before
folk
it
would
not
have
amounted
to
that
in
reality
because
i
had
clothes
on
underneath
but
the
prejudices
of
one
s
breeding
are
not
gotten
rid
of
just
at
a
jump
and
i
knew
that
when
it
came
to
stripping
off
that
bob
tailed
iron
petticoat
i
should
be
embarrassed
with
the
storm
came
a
change
of
weather
and
the
stronger
the
wind
blew
and
the
wilder
the
rain
lashed
around
the
colder
and
colder
it
got
pretty
soon
various
kinds
of
bugs
and
ants
and
worms
and
things
began
to
flock
in
out
of
the
wet
and
crawl
down
inside
my
armor
to
get
warm
and
while
some
of
them
behaved
well
enough
and
snuggled
up
amongst
my
clothes
and
got
quiet
the
majority
were
of
a
restless
uncomfortable
sort
and
never
stayed
still
but
went
on
prowling
and
hunting
for
they
did
not
know
what
especially
the
ants
which
went
tickling
along
in
wearisome
procession
from
one
end
of
me
to
the
other
by
the
hour
and
are
a
kind
of
creatures
which
i
never
wish
to
sleep
with
again
it
would
be
my
advice
to
persons
situated
in
this
way
to
not
roll
or
thrash
around
because
this
excites
the
interest
of
all
the
different
sorts
of
animals
and
makes
every
last
one
of
them
want
to
turn
out
and
see
what
is
going
on
and
this
makes
things
worse
than
they
were
before
and
of
course
makes
you
objurgate
harder
too
if
you
can
still
if
one
did
not
roll
and
thrash
around
he
would
die
so
perhaps
it
is
as
well
to
do
one
way
as
the
other
there
is
no
real
choice
even
after
i
was
frozen
solid
i
could
still
distinguish
that
tickling
just
as
a
corpse
does
when
he
is
taking
electric
treatment
i
said
i
would
never
wear
armor
after
this
trip
all
those
trying
hours
whilst
i
was
frozen
and
yet
was
in
a
living
fire
as
you
may
say
on
account
of
that
swarm
of
crawlers
that
same
unanswerable
question
kept
circling
and
circling
through
my
tired
head
how
do
people
stand
this
miserable
armor
how
have
they
managed
to
stand
it
all
these
generations
how
can
they
sleep
at
night
for
dreading
the
tortures
of
next
day
when
the
morning
came
at
last
i
was
in
a
bad
enough
plight
seedy
drowsy
fagged
from
want
of
sleep
weary
from
thrashing
around
famished
from
long
fasting
pining
for
a
bath
and
to
get
rid
of
the
animals
and
crippled
with
rheumatism
and
how
had
it
fared
with
the
nobly
born
the
titled
aristocrat
the
demoiselle
alisande
la
carteloise
why
she
was
as
fresh
as
a
squirrel
she
had
slept
like
the
dead
and
as
for
a
bath
probably
neither
she
nor
any
other
noble
in
the
land
had
ever
had
one
and
so
she
was
not
missing
it
measured
by
modern
standards
they
were
merely
modified
savages
those
people
this
noble
lady
showed
no
impatience
to
get
to
breakfast
and
that
smacks
of
the
savage
too
on
their
journeys
those
britons
were
used
to
long
fasts
and
knew
how
to
bear
them
and
also
how
to
freight
up
against
probable
fasts
before
starting
after
the
style
of
the
indian
and
the
anaconda
as
like
as
not
sandy
was
loaded
for
a
three
day
stretch
we
were
off
before
sunrise
sandy
riding
and
i
limping
along
behind
in
half
an
hour
we
came
upon
a
group
of
ragged
poor
creatures
who
had
assembled
to
mend
the
thing
which
was
regarded
as
a
road
they
were
as
humble
as
animals
to
me
and
when
i
proposed
to
breakfast
with
them
they
were
so
flattered
so
overwhelmed
by
this
extraordinary
condescension
of
mine
that
at
first
they
were
not
able
to
believe
that
i
was
in
earnest
my
lady
put
up
her
scornful
lip
and
withdrew
to
one
side
she
said
in
their
hearing
that
she
would
as
soon
think
of
eating
with
the
other
cattle
a
remark
which
embarrassed
these
poor
devils
merely
because
it
referred
to
them
and
not
because
it
insulted
or
offended
them
for
it
didn
t
and
yet
they
were
not
slaves
not
chattels
by
a
sarcasm
of
law
and
phrase
they
were
freemen
seven
tenths
of
the
free
population
of
the
country
were
of
just
their
class
and
degree
small
independent
farmers
artisans
etc
which
is
to
say
they
were
the
nation
the
actual
nation
they
were
about
all
of
it
that
was
useful
or
worth
saving
or
really
respect
worthy
and
to
subtract
them
would
have
been
to
subtract
the
nation
and
leave
behind
some
dregs
some
refuse
in
the
shape
of
a
king
nobility
and
gentry
idle
unproductive
acquainted
mainly
with
the
arts
of
wasting
and
destroying
and
of
no
sort
of
use
or
value
in
any
rationally
constructed
world
and
yet
by
ingenious
contrivance
this
gilded
minority
instead
of
being
in
the
tail
of
the
procession
where
it
belonged
was
marching
head
up
and
banners
flying
at
the
other
end
of
it
had
elected
itself
to
be
the
nation
and
these
innumerable
clams
had
permitted
it
so
long
that
they
had
come
at
last
to
accept
it
as
a
truth
and
not
only
that
but
to
believe
it
right
and
as
it
should
be
the
priests
had
told
their
fathers
and
themselves
that
this
ironical
state
of
things
was
ordained
of
god
and
so
not
reflecting
upon
how
unlike
god
it
would
be
to
amuse
himself
with
sarcasms
and
especially
such
poor
transparent
ones
as
this
they
had
dropped
the
matter
there
and
become
respectfully
quiet
the
talk
of
these
meek
people
had
a
strange
enough
sound
in
a
formerly
american
ear
they
were
freemen
but
they
could
not
leave
the
estates
of
their
lord
or
their
bishop
without
his
permission
they
could
not
prepare
their
own
bread
but
must
have
their
corn
ground
and
their
bread
baked
at
his
mill
and
his
bakery
and
pay
roundly
for
the
same
they
could
not
sell
a
piece
of
their
own
property
without
paying
him
a
handsome
percentage
of
the
proceeds
nor
buy
a
piece
of
somebody
else
s
without
remembering
him
in
cash
for
the
privilege
they
had
to
harvest
his
grain
for
him
gratis
and
be
ready
to
come
at
a
moment
s
notice
leaving
their
own
crop
to
destruction
by
the
threatened
storm
they
had
to
let
him
plant
fruit
trees
in
their
fields
and
then
keep
their
indignation
to
themselves
when
his
heedless
fruit
gatherers
trampled
the
grain
around
the
trees
they
had
to
smother
their
anger
when
his
hunting
parties
galloped
through
their
fields
laying
waste
the
result
of
their
patient
toil
they
were
not
allowed
to
keep
doves
themselves
and
when
the
swarms
from
my
lord
s
dovecote
settled
on
their
crops
they
must
not
lose
their
temper
and
kill
a
bird
for
awful
would
the
penalty
be
when
the
harvest
was
at
last
gathered
then
came
the
procession
of
robbers
to
levy
their
blackmail
upon
it
first
the
church
carted
off
its
fat
tenth
then
the
king
s
commissioner
took
his
twentieth
then
my
lord
s
people
made
a
mighty
inroad
upon
the
remainder
after
which
the
skinned
freeman
had
liberty
to
bestow
the
remnant
in
his
barn
in
case
it
was
worth
the
trouble
there
were
taxes
and
taxes
and
taxes
and
more
taxes
and
taxes
again
and
yet
other
taxes
upon
this
free
and
independent
pauper
but
none
upon
his
lord
the
baron
or
the
bishop
none
upon
the
wasteful
nobility
or
the
all
devouring
church
if
the
baron
would
sleep
unvexed
the
freeman
must
sit
up
all
night
after
his
day
s
work
and
whip
the
ponds
to
keep
the
frogs
quiet
if
the
freeman
s
daughter
but
no
that
last
infamy
of
monarchical
government
is
unprintable
and
finally
if
the
freeman
grown
desperate
with
his
tortures
found
his
life
unendurable
under
such
conditions
and
sacrificed
it
and
fled
to
death
for
mercy
and
refuge
the
gentle
church
condemned
him
to
eternal
fire
the
gentle
law
buried
him
at
midnight
at
the
cross
roads
with
a
stake
through
his
back
and
his
master
the
baron
or
the
bishop
confiscated
all
his
property
and
turned
his
widow
and
his
orphans
out
of
doors
and
here
were
these
freemen
assembled
in
the
early
morning
to
work
on
their
lord
the
bishop
s
road
three
days
each
gratis
every
head
of
a
family
and
every
son
of
a
family
three
days
each
gratis
and
a
day
or
so
added
for
their
servants
why
it
was
like
reading
about
france
and
the
french
before
the
ever
memorable
and
blessed
revolution
which
swept
a
thousand
years
of
such
villany
away
in
one
swift
tidal
wave
of
blood
one
a
settlement
of
that
hoary
debt
in
the
proportion
of
half
a
drop
of
blood
for
each
hogshead
of
it
that
had
been
pressed
by
slow
tortures
out
of
that
people
in
the
weary
stretch
of
ten
centuries
of
wrong
and
shame
and
misery
the
like
of
which
was
not
to
be
mated
but
in
hell
there
were
two
reigns
of
terror
if
we
would
but
remember
it
and
consider
it
the
one
wrought
murder
in
hot
passion
the
other
in
heartless
cold
blood
the
one
lasted
mere
months
the
other
had
lasted
a
thousand
years
the
one
inflicted
death
upon
ten
thousand
persons
the
other
upon
a
hundred
millions
but
our
shudders
are
all
for
the
horrors
of
the
minor
terror
the
momentary
terror
so
to
speak
whereas
what
is
the
horror
of
swift
death
by
the
axe
compared
with
lifelong
death
from
hunger
cold
insult
cruelty
and
heart
break
what
is
swift
death
by
lightning
compared
with
death
by
slow
fire
at
the
stake
a
city
cemetery
could
contain
the
coffins
filled
by
that
brief
terror
which
we
have
all
been
so
diligently
taught
to
shiver
at
and
mourn
over
but
all
france
could
hardly
contain
the
coffins
filled
by
that
older
and
real
terror
that
unspeakably
bitter
and
awful
terror
which
none
of
us
has
been
taught
to
see
in
its
vastness
or
pity
as
it
deserves
these
poor
ostensible
freemen
who
were
sharing
their
breakfast
and
their
talk
with
me
were
as
full
of
humble
reverence
for
their
king
and
church
and
nobility
as
their
worst
enemy
could
desire
there
was
something
pitifully
ludicrous
about
it
i
asked
them
if
they
supposed
a
nation
of
people
ever
existed
who
with
a
free
vote
in
every
man
s
hand
would
elect
that
a
single
family
and
its
descendants
should
reign
over
it
forever
whether
gifted
or
boobies
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
families
including
the
voter
s
and
would
also
elect
that
a
certain
hundred
families
should
be
raised
to
dizzy
summits
of
rank
and
clothed
on
with
offensive
transmissible
glories
and
privileges
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
of
the
nation
s
families
including
his
own
they
all
looked
unhit
and
said
they
didn
t
know
that
they
had
never
thought
about
it
before
and
it
hadn
t
ever
occurred
to
them
that
a
nation
could
be
so
situated
that
every
man
could
have
a
say
in
the
government
i
said
i
had
seen
one
and
that
it
would
last
until
it
had
an
established
church
again
they
were
all
unhit
at
first
but
presently
one
man
looked
up
and
asked
me
to
state
that
proposition
again
and
state
it
slowly
so
it
could
soak
into
his
understanding
i
did
it
and
after
a
little
he
had
the
idea
and
he
brought
his
fist
down
and
said
he
didn
t
believe
a
nation
where
every
man
had
a
vote
would
voluntarily
get
down
in
the
mud
and
dirt
in
any
such
way
and
that
to
steal
from
a
nation
its
will
and
preference
must
be
a
crime
and
the
first
of
all
crimes
i
said
to
myself
this
one
s
a
man
if
i
were
backed
by
enough
of
his
sort
i
would
make
a
strike
for
the
welfare
of
this
country
and
try
to
prove
myself
its
loyalest
citizen
by
making
a
wholesome
change
in
its
system
of
government
you
see
my
kind
of
loyalty
was
loyalty
to
one
s
country
not
to
its
institutions
or
its
office
holders
the
country
is
the
real
thing
the
substantial
thing
the
eternal
thing
it
is
the
thing
to
watch
over
and
care
for
and
be
loyal
to
institutions
are
extraneous
they
are
its
mere
clothing
and
clothing
can
wear
out
become
ragged
cease
to
be
comfortable
cease
to
protect
the
body
from
winter
disease
and
death
to
be
loyal
to
rags
to
shout
for
rags
to
worship
rags
to
die
for
rags
that
is
a
loyalty
of
unreason
it
is
pure
animal
it
belongs
to
monarchy
was
invented
by
monarchy
let
monarchy
keep
it
i
was
from
connecticut
whose
constitution
declares
that
all
political
power
is
inherent
in
the
people
and
all
free
governments
are
founded
on
their
authority
and
instituted
for
their
benefit
and
that
they
have
at
all
times
an
undeniable
and
indefeasible
right
to
alter
their
form
of
government
in
such
a
manner
as
they
may
think
expedient
under
that
gospel
the
citizen
who
thinks
he
sees
that
the
commonwealth
s
political
clothes
are
worn
out
and
yet
holds
his
peace
and
does
not
agitate
for
a
new
suit
is
disloyal
he
is
a
traitor
that
he
may
be
the
only
one
who
thinks
he
sees
this
decay
does
not
excuse
him
it
is
his
duty
to
agitate
anyway
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
others
to
vote
him
down
if
they
do
not
see
the
matter
as
he
does
and
now
here
i
was
in
a
country
where
a
right
to
say
how
the
country
should
be
governed
was
restricted
to
six
persons
in
each
thousand
of
its
population
for
the
nine
hundred
and
ninety
four
to
express
dissatisfaction
with
the
regnant
system
and
propose
to
change
it
would
have
made
the
whole
six
shudder
as
one
man
it
would
have
been
so
disloyal
so
dishonorable
such
putrid
black
treason
so
to
speak
i
was
become
a
stockholder
in
a
corporation
where
nine
hundred
and
ninety
four
of
the
members
furnished
all
the
money
and
did
all
the
work
and
the
other
six
elected
themselves
a
permanent
board
of
direction
and
took
all
the
dividends
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
the
nine
hundred
and
ninety
four
dupes
needed
was
a
new
deal
the
thing
that
would
have
best
suited
the
circus
side
of
my
nature
would
have
been
to
resign
the
boss
ship
and
get
up
an
insurrection
and
turn
it
into
a
revolution
but
i
knew
that
the
jack
cade
or
the
wat
tyler
who
tries
such
a
thing
without
first
educating
his
materials
up
to
revolution
grade
is
almost
absolutely
certain
to
get
left
i
had
never
been
accustomed
to
getting
left
even
if
i
do
say
it
myself
wherefore
the
deal
which
had
been
for
some
time
working
into
shape
in
my
mind
was
of
a
quite
different
pattern
from
the
cade
tyler
sort
so
i
did
not
talk
blood
and
insurrection
to
that
man
there
who
sat
munching
black
bread
with
that
abused
and
mistaught
herd
of
human
sheep
but
took
him
aside
and
talked
matter
of
another
sort
to
him
after
i
had
finished
i
got
him
to
lend
me
a
little
ink
from
his
veins
and
with
this
and
a
sliver
i
wrote
on
a
piece
of
bark
put
him
in
the
man
factory
and
gave
it
to
him
and
said
take
it
to
the
palace
at
camelot
and
give
it
into
the
hands
of
amyas
le
poulet
whom
i
call
clarence
and
he
will
understand
he
is
a
priest
then
said
the
man
and
some
of
the
enthusiasm
went
out
of
his
face
how
a
priest
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
no
chattel
of
the
church
no
bond
slave
of
pope
or
bishop
can
enter
my
man
factory
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
you
couldn
t
enter
unless
your
religion
whatever
it
might
be
was
your
own
free
property
marry
it
is
so
and
for
that
i
was
glad
wherefore
it
liked
me
not
and
bred
in
me
a
cold
doubt
to
hear
of
this
priest
being
there
but
he
isn
t
a
priest
i
tell
you
the
man
looked
far
from
satisfied
he
said
he
is
not
a
priest
and
yet
can
read
he
is
not
a
priest
and
yet
can
read
yes
and
write
too
for
that
matter
i
taught
him
myself
the
man
s
face
cleared
and
it
is
the
first
thing
that
you
yourself
will
be
taught
in
that
factory
i
i
would
give
blood
out
of
my
heart
to
know
that
art
why
i
will
be
your
slave
your
no
you
won
t
you
won
t
be
anybody
s
slave
take
your
family
and
go
along
your
lord
the
bishop
will
confiscate
your
small
property
but
no
matter
clarence
will
fix
you
all
right
chapter
xiv
defend
thee
lord
i
paid
three
pennies
for
my
breakfast
and
a
most
extravagant
price
it
was
too
seeing
that
one
could
have
breakfasted
a
dozen
persons
for
that
money
but
i
was
feeling
good
by
this
time
and
i
had
always
been
a
kind
of
spendthrift
anyway
and
then
these
people
had
wanted
to
give
me
the
food
for
nothing
scant
as
their
provision
was
and
so
it
was
a
grateful
pleasure
to
emphasize
my
appreciation
and
sincere
thankfulness
with
a
good
big
financial
lift
where
the
money
would
do
so
much
more
good
than
it
would
in
my
helmet
where
these
pennies
being
made
of
iron
and
not
stinted
in
weight
my
half
dollar
s
worth
was
a
good
deal
of
a
burden
to
me
i
spent
money
rather
too
freely
in
those
days
it
is
true
but
one
reason
for
it
was
that
i
hadn
t
got
the
proportions
of
things
entirely
adjusted
even
yet
after
so
long
a
sojourn
in
britain
hadn
t
got
along
to
where
i
was
able
to
absolutely
realize
that
a
penny
in
arthur
s
land
and
a
couple
of
dollars
in
connecticut
were
about
one
and
the
same
thing
just
twins
as
you
may
say
in
purchasing
power
if
my
start
from
camelot
could
have
been
delayed
a
very
few
days
i
could
have
paid
these
people
in
beautiful
new
coins
from
our
own
mint
and
that
would
have
pleased
me
and
them
too
not
less
i
had
adopted
the
american
values
exclusively
in
a
week
or
two
now
cents
nickels
dimes
quarters
and
half
dollars
and
also
a
trifle
of
gold
would
be
trickling
in
thin
but
steady
streams
all
through
the
commercial
veins
of
the
kingdom
and
i
looked
to
see
this
new
blood
freshen
up
its
life
the
farmers
were
bound
to
throw
in
something
to
sort
of
offset
my
liberality
whether
i
would
or
no
so
i
let
them
give
me
a
flint
and
steel
and
as
soon
as
they
had
comfortably
bestowed
sandy
and
me
on
our
horse
i
lit
my
pipe
when
the
first
blast
of
smoke
shot
out
through
the
bars
of
my
helmet
all
those
people
broke
for
the
woods
and
sandy
went
over
backwards
and
struck
the
ground
with
a
dull
thud
they
thought
i
was
one
of
those
fire
belching
dragons
they
had
heard
so
much
about
from
knights
and
other
professional
liars
i
had
infinite
trouble
to
persuade
those
people
to
venture
back
within
explaining
distance
then
i
told
them
that
this
was
only
a
bit
of
enchantment
which
would
work
harm
to
none
but
my
enemies
and
i
promised
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
that
if
all
who
felt
no
enmity
toward
me
would
come
forward
and
pass
before
me
they
should
see
that
only
those
who
remained
behind
would
be
struck
dead
the
procession
moved
with
a
good
deal
of
promptness
there
were
no
casualties
to
report
for
nobody
had
curiosity
enough
to
remain
behind
to
see
what
would
happen
i
lost
some
time
now
for
these
big
children
their
fears
gone
became
so
ravished
with
wonder
over
my
awe
compelling
fireworks
that
i
had
to
stay
there
and
smoke
a
couple
of
pipes
out
before
they
would
let
me
go
still
the
delay
was
not
wholly
unproductive
for
it
took
all
that
time
to
get
sandy
thoroughly
wonted
to
the
new
thing
she
being
so
close
to
it
you
know
it
plugged
up
her
conversation
mill
too
for
a
considerable
while
and
that
was
a
gain
but
above
all
other
benefits
accruing
i
had
learned
something
i
was
ready
for
any
giant
or
any
ogre
that
might
come
along
now
we
tarried
with
a
holy
hermit
that
night
and
my
opportunity
came
about
the
middle
of
the
next
afternoon
we
were
crossing
a
vast
meadow
by
way
of
short
cut
and
i
was
musing
absently
hearing
nothing
seeing
nothing
when
sandy
suddenly
interrupted
a
remark
which
she
had
begun
that
morning
with
the
cry
defend
thee
lord
peril
of
life
is
toward
and
she
slipped
down
from
the
horse
and
ran
a
little
way
and
stood
i
looked
up
and
saw
far
off
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
half
a
dozen
armed
knights
and
their
squires
and
straightway
there
was
bustle
among
them
and
tightening
of
saddle
girths
for
the
mount
my
pipe
was
ready
and
would
have
been
lit
if
i
had
not
been
lost
in
thinking
about
how
to
banish
oppression
from
this
land
and
restore
to
all
its
people
their
stolen
rights
and
manhood
without
disobliging
anybody
i
lit
up
at
once
and
by
the
time
i
had
got
a
good
head
of
reserved
steam
on
here
they
came
all
together
too
none
of
those
chivalrous
magnanimities
which
one
reads
so
much
about
one
courtly
rascal
at
a
time
and
the
rest
standing
by
to
see
fair
play
no
they
came
in
a
body
they
came
with
a
whirr
and
a
rush
they
came
like
a
volley
from
a
battery
came
with
heads
low
down
plumes
streaming
out
behind
lances
advanced
at
a
level
it
was
a
handsome
sight
a
beautiful
sight
for
a
man
up
a
tree
i
laid
my
lance
in
rest
and
waited
with
my
heart
beating
till
the
iron
wave
was
just
ready
to
break
over
me
then
spouted
a
column
of
white
smoke
through
the
bars
of
my
helmet
you
should
have
seen
the
wave
go
to
pieces
and
scatter
this
was
a
finer
sight
than
the
other
one
but
these
people
stopped
two
or
three
hundred
yards
away
and
this
troubled
me
my
satisfaction
collapsed
and
fear
came
i
judged
i
was
a
lost
man
but
sandy
was
radiant
and
was
going
to
be
eloquent
but
i
stopped
her
and
told
her
my
magic
had
miscarried
somehow
or
other
and
she
must
mount
with
all
despatch
and
we
must
ride
for
life
no
she
wouldn
t
she
said
that
my
enchantment
had
disabled
those
knights
they
were
not
riding
on
because
they
couldn
t
wait
they
would
drop
out
of
their
saddles
presently
and
we
would
get
their
horses
and
harness
i
could
not
deceive
such
trusting
simplicity
so
i
said
it
was
a
mistake
that
when
my
fireworks
killed
at
all
they
killed
instantly
no
the
men
would
not
die
there
was
something
wrong
about
my
apparatus
i
couldn
t
tell
what
but
we
must
hurry
and
get
away
for
those
people
would
attack
us
again
in
a
minute
sandy
laughed
and
said
lack
a
day
sir
they
be
not
of
that
breed
sir
launcelot
will
give
battle
to
dragons
and
will
abide
by
them
and
will
assail
them
again
and
yet
again
and
still
again
until
he
do
conquer
and
destroy
them
and
so
likewise
will
sir
pellinore
and
sir
aglovale
and
sir
carados
and
mayhap
others
but
there
be
none
else
that
will
venture
it
let
the
idle
say
what
the
idle
will
and
la
as
to
yonder
base
rufflers
think
ye
they
have
not
their
fill
but
yet
desire
more
well
then
what
are
they
waiting
for
why
don
t
they
leave
nobody
s
hindering
good
land
i
m
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
i
m
sure
leave
is
it
oh
give
thyself
easement
as
to
that
they
dream
not
of
it
no
not
they
they
wait
to
yield
them
come
really
is
that
sooth
as
you
people
say
if
they
want
to
why
don
t
they
it
would
like
them
much
but
an
ye
wot
how
dragons
are
esteemed
ye
would
not
hold
them
blamable
they
fear
to
come
well
then
suppose
i
go
to
them
instead
and
ah
wit
ye
well
they
would
not
abide
your
coming
i
will
go
and
she
did
she
was
a
handy
person
to
have
along
on
a
raid
i
would
have
considered
this
a
doubtful
errand
myself
i
presently
saw
the
knights
riding
away
and
sandy
coming
back
that
was
a
relief
i
judged
she
had
somehow
failed
to
get
the
first
innings
i
mean
in
the
conversation
otherwise
the
interview
wouldn
t
have
been
so
short
but
it
turned
out
that
she
had
managed
the
business
well
in
fact
admirably
she
said
that
when
she
told
those
people
i
was
the
boss
it
hit
them
where
they
lived
smote
them
sore
with
fear
and
dread
was
her
word
and
then
they
were
ready
to
put
up
with
anything
she
might
require
so
she
swore
them
to
appear
at
arthur
s
court
within
two
days
and
yield
them
with
horse
and
harness
and
be
my
knights
henceforth
and
subject
to
my
command
how
much
better
she
managed
that
thing
than
i
should
have
done
it
myself
she
was
a
daisy
chapter
xv
sandy
s
tale
and
so
i
m
proprietor
of
some
knights
said
i
as
we
rode
off
who
would
ever
have
supposed
that
i
should
live
to
list
up
assets
of
that
sort
i
shan
t
know
what
to
do
with
them
unless
i
raffle
them
off
how
many
of
them
are
there
sandy
seven
please
you
sir
and
their
squires
it
is
a
good
haul
who
are
they
where
do
they
hang
out
where
do
they
hang
out
yes
where
do
they
live
ah
i
understood
thee
not
that
will
i
tell
eftsoons
then
she
said
musingly
and
softly
turning
the
words
daintily
over
her
tongue
hang
they
out
hang
they
out
where
hang
where
do
they
hang
out
eh
right
so
where
do
they
hang
out
of
a
truth
the
phrase
hath
a
fair
and
winsome
grace
and
is
prettily
worded
withal
i
will
repeat
it
anon
and
anon
in
mine
idlesse
whereby
i
may
peradventure
learn
it
where
do
they
hang
out
even
so
already
it
falleth
trippingly
from
my
tongue
and
forasmuch
as
don
t
forget
the
cowboys
sandy
cowboys
yes
the
knights
you
know
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
them
a
while
back
you
remember
figuratively
speaking
game
s
called
game
yes
yes
yes
go
to
the
bat
i
mean
get
to
work
on
your
statistics
and
don
t
burn
so
much
kindling
getting
your
fire
started
tell
me
about
the
knights
i
will
well
and
lightly
will
begin
so
they
two
departed
and
rode
into
a
great
forest
and
great
scott
you
see
i
recognized
my
mistake
at
once
i
had
set
her
works
a
going
it
was
my
own
fault
she
would
be
thirty
days
getting
down
to
those
facts
and
she
generally
began
without
a
preface
and
finished
without
a
result
if
you
interrupted
her
she
would
either
go
right
along
without
noticing
or
answer
with
a
couple
of
words
and
go
back
and
say
the
sentence
over
again
so
interruptions
only
did
harm
and
yet
i
had
to
interrupt
and
interrupt
pretty
frequently
too
in
order
to
save
my
life
a
person
would
die
if
he
let
her
monotony
drip
on
him
right
along
all
day
great
scott
i
said
in
my
distress
she
went
right
back
and
began
over
again
so
they
two
departed
and
rode
into
a
great
forest
and
which
two
sir
gawaine
and
sir
uwaine
and
so
they
came
to
an
abbey
of
monks
and
there
were
well
lodged
so
on
the
morn
they
heard
their
masses
in
the
abbey
and
so
they
rode
forth
till
they
came
to
a
great
forest
then
was
sir
gawaine
ware
in
a
valley
by
a
turret
of
twelve
fair
damsels
and
two
knights
armed
on
great
horses
and
the
damsels
went
to
and
fro
by
a
tree
and
then
was
sir
gawaine
ware
how
there
hung
a
white
shield
on
that
tree
and
ever
as
the
damsels
came
by
it
they
spit
upon
it
and
some
threw
mire
upon
the
shield
now
if
i
hadn
t
seen
the
like
myself
in
this
country
sandy
i
wouldn
t
believe
it
but
i
ve
seen
it
and
i
can
just
see
those
creatures
now
parading
before
that
shield
and
acting
like
that
the
women
here
do
certainly
act
like
all
possessed
yes
and
i
mean
your
best
too
society
s
very
choicest
brands
the
humblest
hello
girl
along
ten
thousand
miles
of
wire
could
teach
gentleness
patience
modesty
manners
to
the
highest
duchess
in
arthur
s
land
hello
girl
yes
but
don
t
you
ask
me
to
explain
it
s
a
new
kind
of
a
girl
they
don
t
have
them
here
one
often
speaks
sharply
to
them
when
they
are
not
the
least
in
fault
and
he
can
t
get
over
feeling
sorry
for
it
and
ashamed
of
himself
in
thirteen
hundred
years
it
s
such
shabby
mean
conduct
and
so
unprovoked
the
fact
is
no
gentleman
ever
does
it
though
i
well
i
myself
if
i
ve
got
to
confess
peradventure
she
never
mind
her
never
mind
her
i
tell
you
i
couldn
t
ever
explain
her
so
you
would
understand
even
so
be
it
sith
ye
are
so
minded
then
sir
gawaine
and
sir
uwaine
went
and
saluted
them
and
asked
them
why
they
did
that
despite
to
the
shield
sirs
said
the
damsels
we
shall
tell
you
there
is
a
knight
in
this
country
that
owneth
this
white
shield
and
he
is
a
passing
good
man
of
his
hands
but
he
hateth
all
ladies
and
gentlewomen
and
therefore
we
do
all
this
despite
to
the
shield
i
will
say
you
said
sir
gawaine
it
beseemeth
evil
a
good
knight
to
despise
all
ladies
and
gentlewomen
and
peradventure
though
he
hate
you
he
hath
some
cause
and
peradventure
he
loveth
in
some
other
places
ladies
and
gentlewomen
and
to
be
loved
again
and
he
such
a
man
of
prowess
as
ye
speak
of
man
of
prowess
yes
that
is
the
man
to
please
them
sandy
man
of
brains
that
is
a
thing
they
never
think
of
tom
sayers
john
heenan
john
l
sullivan
pity
but
you
could
be
here
you
would
have
your
legs
under
the
round
table
and
a
sir
in
front
of
your
names
within
the
twenty
four
hours
and
you
could
bring
about
a
new
distribution
of
the
married
princesses
and
duchesses
of
the
court
in
another
twenty
four
the
fact
is
it
is
just
a
sort
of
polished
up
court
of
comanches
and
there
isn
t
a
squaw
in
it
who
doesn
t
stand
ready
at
the
dropping
of
a
hat
to
desert
to
the
buck
with
the
biggest
string
of
scalps
at
his
belt
and
he
be
such
a
man
of
prowess
as
ye
speak
of
said
sir
gawaine
now
what
is
his
name
sir
said
they
his
name
is
marhaus
the
king
s
son
of
ireland
son
of
the
king
of
ireland
you
mean
the
other
form
doesn
t
mean
anything
and
look
out
and
hold
on
tight
now
we
must
jump
this
gully
there
we
are
all
right
now
this
horse
belongs
in
the
circus
he
is
born
before
his
time
i
know
him
well
said
sir
uwaine
he
is
a
passing
good
knight
as
any
is
on
live
on
live
if
you
ve
got
a
fault
in
the
world
sandy
it
is
that
you
are
a
shade
too
archaic
but
it
isn
t
any
matter
for
i
saw
him
once
proved
at
a
justs
where
many
knights
were
gathered
and
that
time
there
might
no
man
withstand
him
ah
said
sir
gawaine
damsels
methinketh
ye
are
to
blame
for
it
is
to
suppose
he
that
hung
that
shield
there
will
not
be
long
therefrom
and
then
may
those
knights
match
him
on
horseback
and
that
is
more
your
worship
than
thus
for
i
will
abide
no
longer
to
see
a
knight
s
shield
dishonored
and
therewith
sir
uwaine
and
sir
gawaine
departed
a
little
from
them
and
then
were
they
ware
where
sir
marhaus
came
riding
on
a
great
horse
straight
toward
them
and
when
the
twelve
damsels
saw
sir
marhaus
they
fled
into
the
turret
as
they
were
wild
so
that
some
of
them
fell
by
the
way
then
the
one
of
the
knights
of
the
tower
dressed
his
shield
and
said
on
high
sir
marhaus
defend
thee
and
so
they
ran
together
that
the
knight
brake
his
spear
on
marhaus
and
sir
marhaus
smote
him
so
hard
that
he
brake
his
neck
and
the
horse
s
back
well
that
is
just
the
trouble
about
this
state
of
things
it
ruins
so
many
horses
that
saw
the
other
knight
of
the
turret
and
dressed
him
toward
marhaus
and
they
went
so
eagerly
together
that
the
knight
of
the
turret
was
soon
smitten
down
horse
and
man
stark
dead
another
horse
gone
i
tell
you
it
is
a
custom
that
ought
to
be
broken
up
i
don
t
see
how
people
with
any
feeling
can
applaud
and
support
it
so
these
two
knights
came
together
with
great
random
i
saw
that
i
had
been
asleep
and
missed
a
chapter
but
i
didn
t
say
anything
i
judged
that
the
irish
knight
was
in
trouble
with
the
visitors
by
this
time
and
this
turned
out
to
be
the
case
that
sir
uwaine
smote
sir
marhaus
that
his
spear
brast
in
pieces
on
the
shield
and
sir
marhaus
smote
him
so
sore
that
horse
and
man
he
bare
to
the
earth
and
hurt
sir
uwaine
on
the
left
side
the
truth
is
alisande
these
archaics
are
a
little
too
simple
the
vocabulary
is
too
limited
and
so
by
consequence
descriptions
suffer
in
the
matter
of
variety
they
run
too
much
to
level
saharas
of
fact
and
not
enough
to
picturesque
detail
this
throws
about
them
a
certain
air
of
the
monotonous
in
fact
the
fights
are
all
alike
a
couple
of
people
come
together
with
great
random
random
is
a
good
word
and
so
is
exegesis
for
that
matter
and
so
is
holocaust
and
defalcation
and
usufruct
and
a
hundred
others
but
land
a
body
ought
to
discriminate
they
come
together
with
great
random
and
a
spear
is
brast
and
one
party
brake
his
shield
and
the
other
one
goes
down
horse
and
man
over
his
horse
tail
and
brake
his
neck
and
then
the
next
candidate
comes
randoming
in
and
brast
his
spear
and
the
other
man
brast
his
shield
and
down
he
goes
horse
and
man
over
his
horse
tail
and
brake
his
neck
and
then
there
s
another
elected
and
another
and
another
and
still
another
till
the
material
is
all
used
up
and
when
you
come
to
figure
up
results
you
can
t
tell
one
fight
from
another
nor
who
whipped
and
as
a
picture
of
living
raging
roaring
battle
sho
why
it
s
pale
and
noiseless
just
ghosts
scuffling
in
a
fog
dear
me
what
would
this
barren
vocabulary
get
out
of
the
mightiest
spectacle
the
burning
of
rome
in
nero
s
time
for
instance
why
it
would
merely
say
town
burned
down
no
insurance
boy
brast
a
window
fireman
brake
his
neck
why
that
ain
t
a
picture
it
was
a
good
deal
of
a
lecture
i
thought
but
it
didn
t
disturb
sandy
didn
t
turn
a
feather
her
steam
soared
steadily
up
again
the
minute
i
took
off
the
lid
then
sir
marhaus
turned
his
horse
and
rode
toward
gawaine
with
his
spear
and
when
sir
gawaine
saw
that
he
dressed
his
shield
and
they
aventred
their
spears
and
they
came
together
with
all
the
might
of
their
horses
that
either
knight
smote
other
so
hard
in
the
midst
of
their
shields
but
sir
gawaine
s
spear
brake
i
knew
it
would
but
sir
marhaus
s
spear
held
and
therewith
sir
gawaine
and
his
horse
rushed
down
to
the
earth
just
so
and
brake
his
back
and
lightly
sir
gawaine
rose
upon
his
feet
and
pulled
out
his
sword
and
dressed
him
toward
sir
marhaus
on
foot
and
therewith
either
came
unto
other
eagerly
and
smote
together
with
their
swords
that
their
shields
flew
in
cantels
and
they
bruised
their
helms
and
their
hauberks
and
wounded
either
other
but
sir
gawaine
fro
it
passed
nine
of
the
clock
waxed
by
the
space
of
three
hours
ever
stronger
and
stronger
and
thrice
his
might
was
increased
all
this
espied
sir
marhaus
and
had
great
wonder
how
his
might
increased
and
so
they
wounded
other
passing
sore
and
then
when
it
was
come
noon
the
pelting
sing
song
of
it
carried
me
forward
to
scenes
and
sounds
of
my
boyhood
days

waxed

drew
toward
evensong
sir
gawaine
s
strength
feebled
and
waxed
passing
faint
that
unnethes
he
might
dure
any
longer
and
sir
marhaus
was
then
bigger
and
bigger
which
strained
his
armor
of
course
and
yet
little
would
one
of
these
people
mind
a
small
thing
like
that
and
so
sir
knight
said
sir
marhaus
i
have
well
felt
that
ye
are
a
passing
good
knight
and
a
marvelous
man
of
might
as
ever
i
felt
any
while
it
lasteth
and
our
quarrels
are
not
great
and
therefore
it
were
a
pity
to
do
you
hurt
for
i
feel
you
are
passing
feeble
ah
said
sir
gawaine
gentle
knight
ye
say
the
word
that
i
should
say
and
therewith
they
took
off
their
helms
and
either
kissed
other
and
there
they
swore
together
either
to
love
other
as
brethren
but
i
lost
the
thread
there
and
dozed
off
to
slumber
thinking
about
what
a
pity
it
was
that
men
with
such
superb
strength
strength
enabling
them
to
stand
up
cased
in
cruelly
burdensome
iron
and
drenched
with
perspiration
and
hack
and
batter
and
bang
each
other
for
six
hours
on
a
stretch
should
not
have
been
born
at
a
time
when
they
could
put
it
to
some
useful
purpose
take
a
jackass
for
instance
a
jackass
has
that
kind
of
strength
and
puts
it
to
a
useful
purpose
and
is
valuable
to
this
world
because
he
is
a
jackass
but
a
nobleman
is
not
valuable
because
he
is
a
jackass
it
is
a
mixture
that
is
always
ineffectual
and
should
never
have
been
attempted
in
the
first
place
and
yet
once
you
start
a
mistake
the
trouble
is
done
and
you
never
know
what
is
going
to
come
of
it
when
i
came
to
myself
again
and
began
to
listen
i
perceived
that
i
had
lost
another
chapter
and
that
alisande
had
wandered
a
long
way
off
with
her
people
and
so
they
rode
and
came
into
a
deep
valley
full
of
stones
and
thereby
they
saw
a
fair
stream
of
water
above
thereby
was
the
head
of
the
stream
a
fair
fountain
and
three
damsels
sitting
thereby
in
this
country
said
sir
marhaus
came
never
knight
since
it
was
christened
but
he
found
strange
adventures
this
is
not
good
form
alisande
sir
marhaus
the
king
s
son
of
ireland
talks
like
all
the
rest
you
ought
to
give
him
a
brogue
or
at
least
a
characteristic
expletive
by
this
means
one
would
recognize
him
as
soon
as
he
spoke
without
his
ever
being
named
it
is
a
common
literary
device
with
the
great
authors
you
should
make
him
say
in
this
country
be
jabers
came
never
knight
since
it
was
christened
but
he
found
strange
adventures
be
jabers
you
see
how
much
better
that
sounds
came
never
knight
but
he
found
strange
adventures
be
jabers
of
a
truth
it
doth
indeed
fair
lord
albeit
tis
passing
hard
to
say
though
peradventure
that
will
not
tarry
but
better
speed
with
usage
and
then
they
rode
to
the
damsels
and
either
saluted
other
and
the
eldest
had
a
garland
of
gold
about
her
head
and
she
was
threescore
winter
of
age
or
more
the
damsel
was
even
so
dear
lord
and
her
hair
was
white
under
the
garland
celluloid
teeth
nine
dollars
a
set
as
like
as
not
the
loose
fit
kind
that
go
up
and
down
like
a
portcullis
when
you
eat
and
fall
out
when
you
laugh
the
second
damsel
was
of
thirty
winter
of
age
with
a
circlet
of
gold
about
her
head
the
third
damsel
was
but
fifteen
year
of
age
billows
of
thought
came
rolling
over
my
soul
and
the
voice
faded
out
of
my
hearing
fifteen
break
my
heart
oh
my
lost
darling
just
her
age
who
was
so
gentle
and
lovely
and
all
the
world
to
me
and
whom
i
shall
never
see
again
how
the
thought
of
her
carries
me
back
over
wide
seas
of
memory
to
a
vague
dim
time
a
happy
time
so
many
many
centuries
hence
when
i
used
to
wake
in
the
soft
summer
mornings
out
of
sweet
dreams
of
her
and
say
hello
central
just
to
hear
her
dear
voice
come
melting
back
to
me
with
a
hello
hank
that
was
music
of
the
spheres
to
my
enchanted
ear
she
got
three
dollars
a
week
but
she
was
worth
it
i
could
not
follow
alisande
s
further
explanation
of
who
our
captured
knights
were
now
i
mean
in
case
she
should
ever
get
to
explaining
who
they
were
my
interest
was
gone
my
thoughts
were
far
away
and
sad
by
fitful
glimpses
of
the
drifting
tale
caught
here
and
there
and
now
and
then
i
merely
noted
in
a
vague
way
that
each
of
these
three
knights
took
one
of
these
three
damsels
up
behind
him
on
his
horse
and
one
rode
north
another
east
the
other
south
to
seek
adventures
and
meet
again
and
lie
after
year
and
day
year
and
day
and
without
baggage
it
was
of
a
piece
with
the
general
simplicity
of
the
country
the
sun
was
now
setting
it
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
when
alisande
had
begun
to
tell
me
who
the
cowboys
were
so
she
had
made
pretty
good
progress
with
it
for
her
she
would
arrive
some
time
or
other
no
doubt
but
she
was
not
a
person
who
could
be
hurried
we
were
approaching
a
castle
which
stood
on
high
ground
a
huge
strong
venerable
structure
whose
gray
towers
and
battlements
were
charmingly
draped
with
ivy
and
whose
whole
majestic
mass
was
drenched
with
splendors
flung
from
the
sinking
sun
it
was
the
largest
castle
we
had
seen
and
so
i
thought
it
might
be
the
one
we
were
after
but
sandy
said
no
she
did
not
know
who
owned
it
she
said
she
had
passed
it
without
calling
when
she
went
down
to
camelot
chapter
xvi
morgan
le
fay
if
knights
errant
were
to
be
believed
not
all
castles
were
desirable
places
to
seek
hospitality
in
as
a
matter
of
fact
knights
errant
were
not
persons
to
be
believed
that
is
measured
by
modern
standards
of
veracity
yet
measured
by
the
standards
of
their
own
time
and
scaled
accordingly
you
got
the
truth
it
was
very
simple
you
discounted
a
statement
ninety
seven
per
cent
the
rest
was
fact
now
after
making
this
allowance
the
truth
remained
that
if
i
could
find
out
something
about
a
castle
before
ringing
the
door
bell
i
mean
hailing
the
warders
it
was
the
sensible
thing
to
do
so
i
was
pleased
when
i
saw
in
the
distance
a
horseman
making
the
bottom
turn
of
the
road
that
wound
down
from
this
castle
as
we
approached
each
other
i
saw
that
he
wore
a
plumed
helmet
and
seemed
to
be
otherwise
clothed
in
steel
but
bore
a
curious
addition
also
a
stiff
square
garment
like
a
herald
s
tabard
however
i
had
to
smile
at
my
own
forgetfulness
when
i
got
nearer
and
read
this
sign
on
his
tabard
persimmon
s
soap
all
the
prime
donna
use
it
that
was
a
little
idea
of
my
own
and
had
several
wholesome
purposes
in
view
toward
the
civilizing
and
uplifting
of
this
nation
in
the
first
place
it
was
a
furtive
underhand
blow
at
this
nonsense
of
knight
errantry
though
nobody
suspected
that
but
me
i
had
started
a
number
of
these
people
out
the
bravest
knights
i
could
get
each
sandwiched
between
bulletin
boards
bearing
one
device
or
another
and
i
judged
that
by
and
by
when
they
got
to
be
numerous
enough
they
would
begin
to
look
ridiculous
and
then
even
the
steel
clad
ass
that
hadn
t
any
board
would
himself
begin
to
look
ridiculous
because
he
was
out
of
the
fashion
secondly
these
missionaries
would
gradually
and
without
creating
suspicion
or
exciting
alarm
introduce
a
rudimentary
cleanliness
among
the
nobility
and
from
them
it
would
work
down
to
the
people
if
the
priests
could
be
kept
quiet
this
would
undermine
the
church
i
mean
would
be
a
step
toward
that
next
education
next
freedom
and
then
she
would
begin
to
crumble
it
being
my
conviction
that
any
established
church
is
an
established
crime
an
established
slave
pen
i
had
no
scruples
but
was
willing
to
assail
it
in
any
way
or
with
any
weapon
that
promised
to
hurt
it
why
in
my
own
former
day
in
remote
centuries
not
yet
stirring
in
the
womb
of
time
there
were
old
englishmen
who
imagined
that
they
had
been
born
in
a
free
country
a
free
country
with
the
corporation
act
and
the
test
still
in
force
in
it
timbers
propped
against
men
s
liberties
and
dishonored
consciences
to
shore
up
an
established
anachronism
with
my
missionaries
were
taught
to
spell
out
the
gilt
signs
on
their
tabards
the
showy
gilding
was
a
neat
idea
i
could
have
got
the
king
to
wear
a
bulletin
board
for
the
sake
of
that
barbaric
splendor
they
were
to
spell
out
these
signs
and
then
explain
to
the
lords
and
ladies
what
soap
was
and
if
the
lords
and
ladies
were
afraid
of
it
get
them
to
try
it
on
a
dog
the
missionary
s
next
move
was
to
get
the
family
together
and
try
it
on
himself
he
was
to
stop
at
no
experiment
however
desperate
that
could
convince
the
nobility
that
soap
was
harmless
if
any
final
doubt
remained
he
must
catch
a
hermit
the
woods
were
full
of
them
saints
they
called
themselves
and
saints
they
were
believed
to
be
they
were
unspeakably
holy
and
worked
miracles
and
everybody
stood
in
awe
of
them
if
a
hermit
could
survive
a
wash
and
that
failed
to
convince
a
duke
give
him
up
let
him
alone
whenever
my
missionaries
overcame
a
knight
errant
on
the
road
they
washed
him
and
when
he
got
well
they
swore
him
to
go
and
get
a
bulletin
board
and
disseminate
soap
and
civilization
the
rest
of
his
days
as
a
consequence
the
workers
in
the
field
were
increasing
by
degrees
and
the
reform
was
steadily
spreading
my
soap
factory
felt
the
strain
early
at
first
i
had
only
two
hands
but
before
i
had
left
home
i
was
already
employing
fifteen
and
running
night
and
day
and
the
atmospheric
result
was
getting
so
pronounced
that
the
king
went
sort
of
fainting
and
gasping
around
and
said
he
did
not
believe
he
could
stand
it
much
longer
and
sir
launcelot
got
so
that
he
did
hardly
anything
but
walk
up
and
down
the
roof
and
swear
although
i
told
him
it
was
worse
up
there
than
anywhere
else
but
he
said
he
wanted
plenty
of
air
and
he
was
always
complaining
that
a
palace
was
no
place
for
a
soap
factory
anyway
and
said
if
a
man
was
to
start
one
in
his
house
he
would
be
damned
if
he
wouldn
t
strangle
him
there
were
ladies
present
too
but
much
these
people
ever
cared
for
that
they
would
swear
before
children
if
the
wind
was
their
way
when
the
factory
was
going
this
missionary
knight
s
name
was
la
cote
male
taile
and
he
said
that
this
castle
was
the
abode
of
morgan
le
fay
sister
of
king
arthur
and
wife
of
king
uriens
monarch
of
a
realm
about
as
big
as
the
district
of
columbia
you
could
stand
in
the
middle
of
it
and
throw
bricks
into
the
next
kingdom
kings
and
kingdoms
were
as
thick
in
britain
as
they
had
been
in
little
palestine
in
joshua
s
time
when
people
had
to
sleep
with
their
knees
pulled
up
because
they
couldn
t
stretch
out
without
a
passport
la
cote
was
much
depressed
for
he
had
scored
here
the
worst
failure
of
his
campaign
he
had
not
worked
off
a
cake
yet
he
had
tried
all
the
tricks
of
the
trade
even
to
the
washing
of
a
hermit
but
the
hermit
died
this
was
indeed
a
bad
failure
for
this
animal
would
now
be
dubbed
a
martyr
and
would
take
his
place
among
the
saints
of
the
roman
calendar
thus
made
he
his
moan
this
poor
sir
la
cote
male
taile
and
sorrowed
passing
sore
and
so
my
heart
bled
for
him
and
i
was
moved
to
comfort
and
stay
him
wherefore
i
said
forbear
to
grieve
fair
knight
for
this
is
not
a
defeat
we
have
brains
you
and
i
and
for
such
as
have
brains
there
are
no
defeats
but
only
victories
observe
how
we
will
turn
this
seeming
disaster
into
an
advertisement
an
advertisement
for
our
soap
and
the
biggest
one
to
draw
that
was
ever
thought
of
an
advertisement
that
will
transform
that
mount
washington
defeat
into
a
matterhorn
victory
we
will
put
on
your
bulletin
board
patronized
by
the
elect
how
does
that
strike
you
verily
it
is
wonderly
bethought
well
a
body
is
bound
to
admit
that
for
just
a
modest
little
one
line
ad
it
s
a
corker
so
the
poor
colporteur
s
griefs
vanished
away
he
was
a
brave
fellow
and
had
done
mighty
feats
of
arms
in
his
time
his
chief
celebrity
rested
upon
the
events
of
an
excursion
like
this
one
of
mine
which
he
had
once
made
with
a
damsel
named
maledisant
who
was
as
handy
with
her
tongue
as
was
sandy
though
in
a
different
way
for
her
tongue
churned
forth
only
railings
and
insult
whereas
sandy
s
music
was
of
a
kindlier
sort
i
knew
his
story
well
and
so
i
knew
how
to
interpret
the
compassion
that
was
in
his
face
when
he
bade
me
farewell
he
supposed
i
was
having
a
bitter
hard
time
of
it
sandy
and
i
discussed
his
story
as
we
rode
along
and
she
said
that
la
cote
s
bad
luck
had
begun
with
the
very
beginning
of
that
trip
for
the
king
s
fool
had
overthrown
him
on
the
first
day
and
in
such
cases
it
was
customary
for
the
girl
to
desert
to
the
conqueror
but
maledisant
didn
t
do
it
and
also
persisted
afterward
in
sticking
to
him
after
all
his
defeats
but
said
i
suppose
the
victor
should
decline
to
accept
his
spoil
she
said
that
that
wouldn
t
answer
he
must
he
couldn
t
decline
it
wouldn
t
be
regular
i
made
a
note
of
that
if
sandy
s
music
got
to
be
too
burdensome
some
time
i
would
let
a
knight
defeat
me
on
the
chance
that
she
would
desert
to
him
in
due
time
we
were
challenged
by
the
warders
from
the
castle
walls
and
after
a
parley
admitted
i
have
nothing
pleasant
to
tell
about
that
visit
but
it
was
not
a
disappointment
for
i
knew
mrs
le
fay
by
reputation
and
was
not
expecting
anything
pleasant
she
was
held
in
awe
by
the
whole
realm
for
she
had
made
everybody
believe
she
was
a
great
sorceress
all
her
ways
were
wicked
all
her
instincts
devilish
she
was
loaded
to
the
eyelids
with
cold
malice
all
her
history
was
black
with
crime
and
among
her
crimes
murder
was
common
i
was
most
curious
to
see
her
as
curious
as
i
could
have
been
to
see
satan
to
my
surprise
she
was
beautiful
black
thoughts
had
failed
to
make
her
expression
repulsive
age
had
failed
to
wrinkle
her
satin
skin
or
mar
its
bloomy
freshness
she
could
have
passed
for
old
uriens
granddaughter
she
could
have
been
mistaken
for
sister
to
her
own
son
as
soon
as
we
were
fairly
within
the
castle
gates
we
were
ordered
into
her
presence
king
uriens
was
there
a
kind
faced
old
man
with
a
subdued
look
and
also
the
son
sir
uwaine
le
blanchemains
in
whom
i
was
of
course
interested
on
account
of
the
tradition
that
he
had
once
done
battle
with
thirty
knights
and
also
on
account
of
his
trip
with
sir
gawaine
and
sir
marhaus
which
sandy
had
been
aging
me
with
but
morgan
was
the
main
attraction
the
conspicuous
personality
here
she
was
head
chief
of
this
household
that
was
plain
she
caused
us
to
be
seated
and
then
she
began
with
all
manner
of
pretty
graces
and
graciousnesses
to
ask
me
questions
dear
me
it
was
like
a
bird
or
a
flute
or
something
talking
i
felt
persuaded
that
this
woman
must
have
been
misrepresented
lied
about
she
trilled
along
and
trilled
along
and
presently
a
handsome
young
page
clothed
like
the
rainbow
and
as
easy
and
undulatory
of
movement
as
a
wave
came
with
something
on
a
golden
salver
and
kneeling
to
present
it
to
her
overdid
his
graces
and
lost
his
balance
and
so
fell
lightly
against
her
knee
she
slipped
a
dirk
into
him
in
as
matter
of
course
a
way
as
another
person
would
have
harpooned
a
rat
poor
child
he
slumped
to
the
floor
twisted
his
silken
limbs
in
one
great
straining
contortion
of
pain
and
was
dead
out
of
the
old
king
was
wrung
an
involuntary
o
h
of
compassion
the
look
he
got
made
him
cut
it
suddenly
short
and
not
put
any
more
hyphens
in
it
sir
uwaine
at
a
sign
from
his
mother
went
to
the
anteroom
and
called
some
servants
and
meanwhile
madame
went
rippling
sweetly
along
with
her
talk
i
saw
that
she
was
a
good
housekeeper
for
while
she
talked
she
kept
a
corner
of
her
eye
on
the
servants
to
see
that
they
made
no
balks
in
handling
the
body
and
getting
it
out
when
they
came
with
fresh
clean
towels
she
sent
back
for
the
other
kind
and
when
they
had
finished
wiping
the
floor
and
were
going
she
indicated
a
crimson
fleck
the
size
of
a
tear
which
their
duller
eyes
had
overlooked
it
was
plain
to
me
that
la
cote
male
taile
had
failed
to
see
the
mistress
of
the
house
often
how
louder
and
clearer
than
any
tongue
does
dumb
circumstantial
evidence
speak
morgan
le
fay
rippled
along
as
musically
as
ever
marvelous
woman
and
what
a
glance
she
had
when
it
fell
in
reproof
upon
those
servants
they
shrunk
and
quailed
as
timid
people
do
when
the
lightning
flashes
out
of
a
cloud
i
could
have
got
the
habit
myself
it
was
the
same
with
that
poor
old
brer
uriens
he
was
always
on
the
ragged
edge
of
apprehension
she
could
not
even
turn
toward
him
but
he
winced
in
the
midst
of
the
talk
i
let
drop
a
complimentary
word
about
king
arthur
forgetting
for
the
moment
how
this
woman
hated
her
brother
that
one
little
compliment
was
enough
she
clouded
up
like
storm
she
called
for
her
guards
and
said
hale
me
these
varlets
to
the
dungeons
that
struck
cold
on
my
ears
for
her
dungeons
had
a
reputation
nothing
occurred
to
me
to
say
or
do
but
not
so
with
sandy
as
the
guard
laid
a
hand
upon
me
she
piped
up
with
the
tranquilest
confidence
and
said
god
s
wounds
dost
thou
covet
destruction
thou
maniac
it
is
the
boss
now
what
a
happy
idea
that
was
and
so
simple
yet
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
i
was
born
modest
not
all
over
but
in
spots
and
this
was
one
of
the
spots
the
effect
upon
madame
was
electrical
it
cleared
her
countenance
and
brought
back
her
smiles
and
all
her
persuasive
graces
and
blandishments
but
nevertheless
she
was
not
able
to
entirely
cover
up
with
them
the
fact
that
she
was
in
a
ghastly
fright
she
said
la
but
do
list
to
thine
handmaid
as
if
one
gifted
with
powers
like
to
mine
might
say
the
thing
which
i
have
said
unto
one
who
has
vanquished
merlin
and
not
be
jesting
by
mine
enchantments
i
foresaw
your
coming
and
by
them
i
knew
you
when
you
entered
here
i
did
but
play
this
little
jest
with
hope
to
surprise
you
into
some
display
of
your
art
as
not
doubting
you
would
blast
the
guards
with
occult
fires
consuming
them
to
ashes
on
the
spot
a
marvel
much
beyond
mine
own
ability
yet
one
which
i
have
long
been
childishly
curious
to
see
the
guards
were
less
curious
and
got
out
as
soon
as
they
got
permission
chapter
xvii
a
royal
banquet
madame
seeing
me
pacific
and
unresentful
no
doubt
judged
that
i
was
deceived
by
her
excuse
for
her
fright
dissolved
away
and
she
was
soon
so
importunate
to
have
me
give
an
exhibition
and
kill
somebody
that
the
thing
grew
to
be
embarrassing
however
to
my
relief
she
was
presently
interrupted
by
the
call
to
prayers
i
will
say
this
much
for
the
nobility
that
tyrannical
murderous
rapacious
and
morally
rotten
as
they
were
they
were
deeply
and
enthusiastically
religious
nothing
could
divert
them
from
the
regular
and
faithful
performance
of
the
pieties
enjoined
by
the
church
more
than
once
i
had
seen
a
noble
who
had
gotten
his
enemy
at
a
disadvantage
stop
to
pray
before
cutting
his
throat
more
than
once
i
had
seen
a
noble
after
ambushing
and
despatching
his
enemy
retire
to
the
nearest
wayside
shrine
and
humbly
give
thanks
without
even
waiting
to
rob
the
body
there
was
to
be
nothing
finer
or
sweeter
in
the
life
of
even
benvenuto
cellini
that
rough
hewn
saint
ten
centuries
later
all
the
nobles
of
britain
with
their
families
attended
divine
service
morning
and
night
daily
in
their
private
chapels
and
even
the
worst
of
them
had
family
worship
five
or
six
times
a
day
besides
the
credit
of
this
belonged
entirely
to
the
church
although
i
was
no
friend
to
that
catholic
church
i
was
obliged
to
admit
this
and
often
in
spite
of
me
i
found
myself
saying
what
would
this
country
be
without
the
church
after
prayers
we
had
dinner
in
a
great
banqueting
hall
which
was
lighted
by
hundreds
of
grease
jets
and
everything
was
as
fine
and
lavish
and
rudely
splendid
as
might
become
the
royal
degree
of
the
hosts
at
the
head
of
the
hall
on
a
dais
was
the
table
of
the
king
queen
and
their
son
prince
uwaine
stretching
down
the
hall
from
this
was
the
general
table
on
the
floor
at
this
above
the
salt
sat
the
visiting
nobles
and
the
grown
members
of
their
families
of
both
sexes
the
resident
court
in
effect
sixty
one
persons
below
the
salt
sat
minor
officers
of
the
household
with
their
principal
subordinates
altogether
a
hundred
and
eighteen
persons
sitting
and
about
as
many
liveried
servants
standing
behind
their
chairs
or
serving
in
one
capacity
or
another
it
was
a
very
fine
show
in
a
gallery
a
band
with
cymbals
horns
harps
and
other
horrors
opened
the
proceedings
with
what
seemed
to
be
the
crude
first
draft
or
original
agony
of
the
wail
known
to
later
centuries
as
in
the
sweet
bye
and
bye
it
was
new
and
ought
to
have
been
rehearsed
a
little
more
for
some
reason
or
other
the
queen
had
the
composer
hanged
after
dinner
after
this
music
the
priest
who
stood
behind
the
royal
table
said
a
noble
long
grace
in
ostensible
latin
then
the
battalion
of
waiters
broke
away
from
their
posts
and
darted
rushed
flew
fetched
and
carried
and
the
mighty
feeding
began
no
words
anywhere
but
absorbing
attention
to
business
the
rows
of
chops
opened
and
shut
in
vast
unison
and
the
sound
of
it
was
like
to
the
muffled
burr
of
subterranean
machinery
the
havoc
continued
an
hour
and
a
half
and
unimaginable
was
the
destruction
of
substantials
of
the
chief
feature
of
the
feast
the
huge
wild
boar
that
lay
stretched
out
so
portly
and
imposing
at
the
start
nothing
was
left
but
the
semblance
of
a
hoop
skirt
and
he
was
but
the
type
and
symbol
of
what
had
happened
to
all
the
other
dishes
with
the
pastries
and
so
on
the
heavy
drinking
began
and
the
talk
gallon
after
gallon
of
wine
and
mead
disappeared
and
everybody
got
comfortable
then
happy
then
sparklingly
joyous
both
sexes
and
by
and
by
pretty
noisy
men
told
anecdotes
that
were
terrific
to
hear
but
nobody
blushed
and
when
the
nub
was
sprung
the
assemblage
let
go
with
a
horse
laugh
that
shook
the
fortress
ladies
answered
back
with
historiettes
that
would
almost
have
made
queen
margaret
of
navarre
or
even
the
great
elizabeth
of
england
hide
behind
a
handkerchief
but
nobody
hid
here
but
only
laughed
howled
you
may
say
in
pretty
much
all
of
these
dreadful
stories
ecclesiastics
were
the
hardy
heroes
but
that
didn
t
worry
the
chaplain
any
he
had
his
laugh
with
the
rest
more
than
that
upon
invitation
he
roared
out
a
song
which
was
of
as
daring
a
sort
as
any
that
was
sung
that
night
by
midnight
everybody
was
fagged
out
and
sore
with
laughing
and
as
a
rule
drunk
some
weepingly
some
affectionately
some
hilariously
some
quarrelsomely
some
dead
and
under
the
table
of
the
ladies
the
worst
spectacle
was
a
lovely
young
duchess
whose
wedding
eve
this
was
and
indeed
she
was
a
spectacle
sure
enough
just
as
she
was
she
could
have
sat
in
advance
for
the
portrait
of
the
young
daughter
of
the
regent
d
orleans
at
the
famous
dinner
whence
she
was
carried
foul
mouthed
intoxicated
and
helpless
to
her
bed
in
the
lost
and
lamented
days
of
the
ancient
regime
suddenly
even
while
the
priest
was
lifting
his
hands
and
all
conscious
heads
were
bowed
in
reverent
expectation
of
the
coming
blessing
there
appeared
under
the
arch
of
the
far
off
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
hall
an
old
and
bent
and
white
haired
lady
leaning
upon
a
crutch
stick
and
she
lifted
the
stick
and
pointed
it
toward
the
queen
and
cried
out
the
wrath
and
curse
of
god
fall
upon
you
woman
without
pity
who
have
slain
mine
innocent
grandchild
and
made
desolate
this
old
heart
that
had
nor
chick
nor
friend
nor
stay
nor
comfort
in
all
this
world
but
him
everybody
crossed
himself
in
a
grisly
fright
for
a
curse
was
an
awful
thing
to
those
people
but
the
queen
rose
up
majestic
with
the
death
light
in
her
eye
and
flung
back
this
ruthless
command
lay
hands
on
her
to
the
stake
with
her
the
guards
left
their
posts
to
obey
it
was
a
shame
it
was
a
cruel
thing
to
see
what
could
be
done
sandy
gave
me
a
look
i
knew
she
had
another
inspiration
i
said
do
what
you
choose
she
was
up
and
facing
toward
the
queen
in
a
moment
she
indicated
me
and
said
madame
he
saith
this
may
not
be
recall
the
commandment
or
he
will
dissolve
the
castle
and
it
shall
vanish
away
like
the
instable
fabric
of
a
dream
confound
it
what
a
crazy
contract
to
pledge
a
person
to
what
if
the
queen
but
my
consternation
subsided
there
and
my
panic
passed
off
for
the
queen
all
in
a
collapse
made
no
show
of
resistance
but
gave
a
countermanding
sign
and
sunk
into
her
seat
when
she
reached
it
she
was
sober
so
were
many
of
the
others
the
assemblage
rose
whiffed
ceremony
to
the
winds
and
rushed
for
the
door
like
a
mob
overturning
chairs
smashing
crockery
tugging
struggling
shouldering
crowding
anything
to
get
out
before
i
should
change
my
mind
and
puff
the
castle
into
the
measureless
dim
vacancies
of
space
well
well
well
they
were
a
superstitious
lot
it
is
all
a
body
can
do
to
conceive
of
it
the
poor
queen
was
so
scared
and
humbled
that
she
was
even
afraid
to
hang
the
composer
without
first
consulting
me
i
was
very
sorry
for
her
indeed
any
one
would
have
been
for
she
was
really
suffering
so
i
was
willing
to
do
anything
that
was
reasonable
and
had
no
desire
to
carry
things
to
wanton
extremities
i
therefore
considered
the
matter
thoughtfully
and
ended
by
having
the
musicians
ordered
into
our
presence
to
play
that
sweet
bye
and
bye
again
which
they
did
then
i
saw
that
she
was
right
and
gave
her
permission
to
hang
the
whole
band
this
little
relaxation
of
sternness
had
a
good
effect
upon
the
queen
a
statesman
gains
little
by
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
iron
clad
authority
upon
all
occasions
that
offer
for
this
wounds
the
just
pride
of
his
subordinates
and
thus
tends
to
undermine
his
strength
a
little
concession
now
and
then
where
it
can
do
no
harm
is
the
wiser
policy
now
that
the
queen
was
at
ease
in
her
mind
once
more
and
measurably
happy
her
wine
naturally
began
to
assert
itself
again
and
it
got
a
little
the
start
of
her
i
mean
it
set
her
music
going
her
silver
bell
of
a
tongue
dear
me
she
was
a
master
talker
it
would
not
become
me
to
suggest
that
it
was
pretty
late
and
that
i
was
a
tired
man
and
very
sleepy
i
wished
i
had
gone
off
to
bed
when
i
had
the
chance
now
i
must
stick
it
out
there
was
no
other
way
so
she
tinkled
along
and
along
in
the
otherwise
profound
and
ghostly
hush
of
the
sleeping
castle
until
by
and
by
there
came
as
if
from
deep
down
under
us
a
far
away
sound
as
of
a
muffled
shriek
with
an
expression
of
agony
about
it
that
made
my
flesh
crawl
the
queen
stopped
and
her
eyes
lighted
with
pleasure
she
tilted
her
graceful
head
as
a
bird
does
when
it
listens
the
sound
bored
its
way
up
through
the
stillness
again
what
is
it
i
said
it
is
truly
a
stubborn
soul
and
endureth
long
it
is
many
hours
now
endureth
what
the
rack
come
ye
shall
see
a
blithe
sight
an
he
yield
not
his
secret
now
ye
shall
see
him
torn
asunder
what
a
silky
smooth
hellion
she
was
and
so
composed
and
serene
when
the
cords
all
down
my
legs
were
hurting
in
sympathy
with
that
man
s
pain
conducted
by
mailed
guards
bearing
flaring
torches
we
tramped
along
echoing
corridors
and
down
stone
stairways
dank
and
dripping
and
smelling
of
mould
and
ages
of
imprisoned
night
a
chill
uncanny
journey
and
a
long
one
and
not
made
the
shorter
or
the
cheerier
by
the
sorceress
s
talk
which
was
about
this
sufferer
and
his
crime
he
had
been
accused
by
an
anonymous
informer
of
having
killed
a
stag
in
the
royal
preserves
i
said
anonymous
testimony
isn
t
just
the
right
thing
your
highness
it
were
fairer
to
confront
the
accused
with
the
accuser
i
had
not
thought
of
that
it
being
but
of
small
consequence
but
an
i
would
i
could
not
for
that
the
accuser
came
masked
by
night
and
told
the
forester
and
straightway
got
him
hence
again
and
so
the
forester
knoweth
him
not
then
is
this
unknown
the
only
person
who
saw
the
stag
killed
marry
no
man
saw
the
killing
but
this
unknown
saw
this
hardy
wretch
near
to
the
spot
where
the
stag
lay
and
came
with
right
loyal
zeal
and
betrayed
him
to
the
forester
so
the
unknown
was
near
the
dead
stag
too
isn
t
it
just
possible
that
he
did
the
killing
himself
his
loyal
zeal
in
a
mask
looks
just
a
shade
suspicious
but
what
is
your
highness
s
idea
for
racking
the
prisoner
where
is
the
profit
he
will
not
confess
else
and
then
were
his
soul
lost
for
his
crime
his
life
is
forfeited
by
the
law
and
of
a
surety
will
i
see
that
he
payeth
it
but
it
were
peril
to
my
own
soul
to
let
him
die
unconfessed
and
unabsolved
nay
i
were
a
fool
to
fling
me
into
hell
for
his
accommodation
but
your
highness
suppose
he
has
nothing
to
confess
as
to
that
we
shall
see
anon
an
i
rack
him
to
death
and
he
confess
not
it
will
peradventure
show
that
he
had
indeed
naught
to
confess
ye
will
grant
that
that
is
sooth
then
shall
i
not
be
damned
for
an
unconfessed
man
that
had
naught
to
confess
wherefore
i
shall
be
safe
it
was
the
stubborn
unreasoning
of
the
time
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
her
arguments
have
no
chance
against
petrified
training
they
wear
it
as
little
as
the
waves
wear
a
cliff
and
her
training
was
everybody
s
the
brightest
intellect
in
the
land
would
not
have
been
able
to
see
that
her
position
was
defective
as
we
entered
the
rack
cell
i
caught
a
picture
that
will
not
go
from
me
i
wish
it
would
a
native
young
giant
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
lay
stretched
upon
the
frame
on
his
back
with
his
wrists
and
ankles
tied
to
ropes
which
led
over
windlasses
at
either
end
there
was
no
color
in
him
his
features
were
contorted
and
set
and
sweat
drops
stood
upon
his
forehead
a
priest
bent
over
him
on
each
side
the
executioner
stood
by
guards
were
on
duty
smoking
torches
stood
in
sockets
along
the
walls
in
a
corner
crouched
a
poor
young
creature
her
face
drawn
with
anguish
a
half
wild
and
hunted
look
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
lap
lay
a
little
child
asleep
just
as
we
stepped
across
the
threshold
the
executioner
gave
his
machine
a
slight
turn
which
wrung
a
cry
from
both
the
prisoner
and
the
woman
but
i
shouted
and
the
executioner
released
the
strain
without
waiting
to
see
who
spoke
i
could
not
let
this
horror
go
on
it
would
have
killed
me
to
see
it
i
asked
the
queen
to
let
me
clear
the
place
and
speak
to
the
prisoner
privately
and
when
she
was
going
to
object
i
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
said
i
did
not
want
to
make
a
scene
before
her
servants
but
i
must
have
my
way
for
i
was
king
arthur
s
representative
and
was
speaking
in
his
name
she
saw
she
had
to
yield
i
asked
her
to
indorse
me
to
these
people
and
then
leave
me
it
was
not
pleasant
for
her
but
she
took
the
pill
and
even
went
further
than
i
was
meaning
to
require
i
only
wanted
the
backing
of
her
own
authority
but
she
said
ye
will
do
in
all
things
as
this
lord
shall
command
it
is
the
boss
it
was
certainly
a
good
word
to
conjure
with
you
could
see
it
by
the
squirming
of
these
rats
the
queen
s
guards
fell
into
line
and
she
and
they
marched
away
with
their
torch
bearers
and
woke
the
echoes
of
the
cavernous
tunnels
with
the
measured
beat
of
their
retreating
footfalls
i
had
the
prisoner
taken
from
the
rack
and
placed
upon
his
bed
and
medicaments
applied
to
his
hurts
and
wine
given
him
to
drink
the
woman
crept
near
and
looked
on
eagerly
lovingly
but
timorously
like
one
who
fears
a
repulse
indeed
she
tried
furtively
to
touch
the
man
s
forehead
and
jumped
back
the
picture
of
fright
when
i
turned
unconsciously
toward
her
it
was
pitiful
to
see
lord
i
said
stroke
him
lass
if
you
want
to
do
anything
you
re
a
mind
to
don
t
mind
me
why
her
eyes
were
as
grateful
as
an
animal
s
when
you
do
it
a
kindness
that
it
understands
the
baby
was
out
of
her
way
and
she
had
her
cheek
against
the
man
s
in
a
minute
and
her
hands
fondling
his
hair
and
her
happy
tears
running
down
the
man
revived
and
caressed
his
wife
with
his
eyes
which
was
all
he
could
do
i
judged
i
might
clear
the
den
now
and
i
did
cleared
it
of
all
but
the
family
and
myself
then
i
said
now
my
friend
tell
me
your
side
of
this
matter
i
know
the
other
side
the
man
moved
his
head
in
sign
of
refusal
but
the
woman
looked
pleased
as
it
seemed
to
me
pleased
with
my
suggestion
i
went
on
you
know
of
me
yes
all
do
in
arthur
s
realms
if
my
reputation
has
come
to
you
right
and
straight
you
should
not
be
afraid
to
speak
the
woman
broke
in
eagerly
ah
fair
my
lord
do
thou
persuade
him
thou
canst
an
thou
wilt
ah
he
suffereth
so
and
it
is
for
me
for
me
and
how
can
i
bear
it
i
would
i
might
see
him
die
a
sweet
swift
death
oh
my
hugo
i
cannot
bear
this
one
and
she
fell
to
sobbing
and
grovelling
about
my
feet
and
still
imploring
imploring
what
the
man
s
death
i
could
not
quite
get
the
bearings
of
the
thing
but
hugo
interrupted
her
and
said
peace
ye
wit
not
what
ye
ask
shall
i
starve
whom
i
love
to
win
a
gentle
death
i
wend
thou
knewest
me
better
well
i
said
i
can
t
quite
make
this
out
it
is
a
puzzle
now
ah
dear
my
lord
an
ye
will
but
persuade
him
consider
how
these
his
tortures
wound
me
oh
and
he
will
not
speak
whereas
the
healing
the
solace
that
lie
in
a
blessed
swift
death
what
are
you
maundering
about
he
s
going
out
from
here
a
free
man
and
whole
he
s
not
going
to
die
the
man
s
white
face
lit
up
and
the
woman
flung
herself
at
me
in
a
most
surprising
explosion
of
joy
and
cried
out
he
is
saved
for
it
is
the
king
s
word
by
the
mouth
of
the
king
s
servant
arthur
the
king
whose
word
is
gold
well
then
you
do
believe
i
can
be
trusted
after
all
why
didn
t
you
before
who
doubted
not
i
indeed
and
not
she
well
why
wouldn
t
you
tell
me
your
story
then
ye
had
made
no
promise
else
had
it
been
otherwise
i
see
i
see
and
yet
i
believe
i
don
t
quite
see
after
all
you
stood
the
torture
and
refused
to
confess
which
shows
plain
enough
to
even
the
dullest
understanding
that
you
had
nothing
to
confess
i
my
lord
how
so
it
was
i
that
killed
the
deer
you
did
oh
dear
this
is
the
most
mixed
up
business
that
ever
dear
lord
i
begged
him
on
my
knees
to
confess
but
you
did
it
gets
thicker
and
thicker
what
did
you
want
him
to
do
that
for
sith
it
would
bring
him
a
quick
death
and
save
him
all
this
cruel
pain
well
yes
there
is
reason
in
that
but
he
didn
t
want
the
quick
death
he
why
of
a
surety
he
did
well
then
why
in
the
world
didn
t
he
confess
ah
sweet
sir
and
leave
my
wife
and
chick
without
bread
and
shelter
oh
heart
of
gold
now
i
see
it
the
bitter
law
takes
the
convicted
man
s
estate
and
beggars
his
widow
and
his
orphans
they
could
torture
you
to
death
but
without
conviction
or
confession
they
could
not
rob
your
wife
and
baby
you
stood
by
them
like
a
man
and
you
true
wife
and
the
woman
that
you
are
you
would
have
bought
him
release
from
torture
at
cost
to
yourself
of
slow
starvation
and
death
well
it
humbles
a
body
to
think
what
your
sex
can
do
when
it
comes
to
self
sacrifice
i
ll
book
you
both
for
my
colony
you
ll
like
it
there
it
s
a
factory
where
i
m
going
to
turn
groping
and
grubbing
automata
into
men
chapter
xviii
in
the
queen
s
dungeons
well
i
arranged
all
that
and
i
had
the
man
sent
to
his
home
i
had
a
great
desire
to
rack
the
executioner
not
because
he
was
a
good
painstaking
and
paingiving
official
for
surely
it
was
not
to
his
discredit
that
he
performed
his
functions
well
but
to
pay
him
back
for
wantonly
cuffing
and
otherwise
distressing
that
young
woman
the
priests
told
me
about
this
and
were
generously
hot
to
have
him
punished
something
of
this
disagreeable
sort
was
turning
up
every
now
and
then
i
mean
episodes
that
showed
that
not
all
priests
were
frauds
and
self
seekers
but
that
many
even
the
great
majority
of
these
that
were
down
on
the
ground
among
the
common
people
were
sincere
and
right
hearted
and
devoted
to
the
alleviation
of
human
troubles
and
sufferings
well
it
was
a
thing
which
could
not
be
helped
so
i
seldom
fretted
about
it
and
never
many
minutes
at
a
time
it
has
never
been
my
way
to
bother
much
about
things
which
you
can
t
cure
but
i
did
not
like
it
for
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
to
keep
people
reconciled
to
an
established
church
we
must
have
a
religion
it
goes
without
saying
but
my
idea
is
to
have
it
cut
up
into
forty
free
sects
so
that
they
will
police
each
other
as
had
been
the
case
in
the
united
states
in
my
time
concentration
of
power
in
a
political
machine
is
bad
and
an
established
church
is
only
a
political
machine
it
was
invented
for
that
it
is
nursed
cradled
preserved
for
that
it
is
an
enemy
to
human
liberty
and
does
no
good
which
it
could
not
better
do
in
a
split
up
and
scattered
condition
that
wasn
t
law
it
wasn
t
gospel
it
was
only
an
opinion
my
opinion
and
i
was
only
a
man
one
man
so
it
wasn
t
worth
any
more
than
the
pope
s
or
any
less
for
that
matter
well
i
couldn
t
rack
the
executioner
neither
would
i
overlook
the
just
complaint
of
the
priests
the
man
must
be
punished
somehow
or
other
so
i
degraded
him
from
his
office
and
made
him
leader
of
the
band
the
new
one
that
was
to
be
started
he
begged
hard
and
said
he
couldn
t
play
a
plausible
excuse
but
too
thin
there
wasn
t
a
musician
in
the
country
that
could
the
queen
was
a
good
deal
outraged
next
morning
when
she
found
she
was
going
to
have
neither
hugo
s
life
nor
his
property
but
i
told
her
she
must
bear
this
cross
that
while
by
law
and
custom
she
certainly
was
entitled
to
both
the
man
s
life
and
his
property
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
and
so
in
arthur
the
king
s
name
i
had
pardoned
him
the
deer
was
ravaging
the
man
s
fields
and
he
had
killed
it
in
sudden
passion
and
not
for
gain
and
he
had
carried
it
into
the
royal
forest
in
the
hope
that
that
might
make
detection
of
the
misdoer
impossible
confound
her
i
couldn
t
make
her
see
that
sudden
passion
is
an
extenuating
circumstance
in
the
killing
of
venison
or
of
a
person
so
i
gave
it
up
and
let
her
sulk
it
out
i
did
think
i
was
going
to
make
her
see
it
by
remarking
that
her
own
sudden
passion
in
the
case
of
the
page
modified
that
crime
crime
she
exclaimed
how
thou
talkest
crime
forsooth
man
i
am
going
to
pay
for
him
oh
it
was
no
use
to
waste
sense
on
her
training
training
is
everything
training
is
all
there
is
to
a
person
we
speak
of
nature
it
is
folly
there
is
no
such
thing
as
nature
what
we
call
by
that
misleading
name
is
merely
heredity
and
training
we
have
no
thoughts
of
our
own
no
opinions
of
our
own
they
are
transmitted
to
us
trained
into
us
all
that
is
original
in
us
and
therefore
fairly
creditable
or
discreditable
to
us
can
be
covered
up
and
hidden
by
the
point
of
a
cambric
needle
all
the
rest
being
atoms
contributed
by
and
inherited
from
a
procession
of
ancestors
that
stretches
back
a
billion
years
to
the
adam
clam
or
grasshopper
or
monkey
from
whom
our
race
has
been
so
tediously
and
ostentatiously
and
unprofitably
developed
and
as
for
me
all
that
i
think
about
in
this
plodding
sad
pilgrimage
this
pathetic
drift
between
the
eternities
is
to
look
out
and
humbly
live
a
pure
and
high
and
blameless
life
and
save
that
one
microscopic
atom
in
me
that
is
truly
me
the
rest
may
land
in
sheol
and
welcome
for
all
i
care
no
confound
her
her
intellect
was
good
she
had
brains
enough
but
her
training
made
her
an
ass
that
is
from
a
many
centuries
later
point
of
view
to
kill
the
page
was
no
crime
it
was
her
right
and
upon
her
right
she
stood
serenely
and
unconscious
of
offense
she
was
a
result
of
generations
of
training
in
the
unexamined
and
unassailed
belief
that
the
law
which
permitted
her
to
kill
a
subject
when
she
chose
was
a
perfectly
right
and
righteous
one
well
we
must
give
even
satan
his
due
she
deserved
a
compliment
for
one
thing
and
i
tried
to
pay
it
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
she
had
a
right
to
kill
the
boy
but
she
was
in
no
wise
obliged
to
pay
for
him
that
was
law
for
some
other
people
but
not
for
her
she
knew
quite
well
that
she
was
doing
a
large
and
generous
thing
to
pay
for
that
lad
and
that
i
ought
in
common
fairness
to
come
out
with
something
handsome
about
it
but
i
couldn
t
my
mouth
refused
i
couldn
t
help
seeing
in
my
fancy
that
poor
old
grandma
with
the
broken
heart
and
that
fair
young
creature
lying
butchered
his
little
silken
pomps
and
vanities
laced
with
his
golden
blood
how
could
she
pay
for
him
whom
could
she
pay
and
so
well
knowing
that
this
woman
trained
as
she
had
been
deserved
praise
even
adulation
i
was
yet
not
able
to
utter
it
trained
as
i
had
been
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
fish
up
a
compliment
from
outside
so
to
speak
and
the
pity
of
it
was
that
it
was
true
madame
your
people
will
adore
you
for
this
quite
true
but
i
meant
to
hang
her
for
it
some
day
if
i
lived
some
of
those
laws
were
too
bad
altogether
too
bad
a
master
might
kill
his
slave
for
nothing
for
mere
spite
malice
or
to
pass
the
time
just
as
we
have
seen
that
the
crowned
head
could
do
it
with
his
slave
that
is
to
say
anybody
a
gentleman
could
kill
a
free
commoner
and
pay
for
him
cash
or
garden
truck
a
noble
could
kill
a
noble
without
expense
as
far
as
the
law
was
concerned
but
reprisals
in
kind
were
to
be
expected
any
body
could
kill
some
body
except
the
commoner
and
the
slave
these
had
no
privileges
if
they
killed
it
was
murder
and
the
law
wouldn
t
stand
murder
it
made
short
work
of
the
experimenter
and
of
his
family
too
if
he
murdered
somebody
who
belonged
up
among
the
ornamental
ranks
if
a
commoner
gave
a
noble
even
so
much
as
a
damiens
scratch
which
didn
t
kill
or
even
hurt
he
got
damiens
dose
for
it
just
the
same
they
pulled
him
to
rags
and
tatters
with
horses
and
all
the
world
came
to
see
the
show
and
crack
jokes
and
have
a
good
time
and
some
of
the
performances
of
the
best
people
present
were
as
tough
and
as
properly
unprintable
as
any
that
have
been
printed
by
the
pleasant
casanova
in
his
chapter
about
the
dismemberment
of
louis
xv
s
poor
awkward
enemy
i
had
had
enough
of
this
grisly
place
by
this
time
and
wanted
to
leave
but
i
couldn
t
because
i
had
something
on
my
mind
that
my
conscience
kept
prodding
me
about
and
wouldn
t
let
me
forget
if
i
had
the
remaking
of
man
he
wouldn
t
have
any
conscience
it
is
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
things
connected
with
a
person
and
although
it
certainly
does
a
great
deal
of
good
it
cannot
be
said
to
pay
in
the
long
run
it
would
be
much
better
to
have
less
good
and
more
comfort
still
this
is
only
my
opinion
and
i
am
only
one
man
others
with
less
experience
may
think
differently
they
have
a
right
to
their
view
i
only
stand
to
this
i
have
noticed
my
conscience
for
many
years
and
i
know
it
is
more
trouble
and
bother
to
me
than
anything
else
i
started
with
i
suppose
that
in
the
beginning
i
prized
it
because
we
prize
anything
that
is
ours
and
yet
how
foolish
it
was
to
think
so
if
we
look
at
it
in
another
way
we
see
how
absurd
it
is
if
i
had
an
anvil
in
me
would
i
prize
it
of
course
not
and
yet
when
you
come
to
think
there
is
no
real
difference
between
a
conscience
and
an
anvil
i
mean
for
comfort
i
have
noticed
it
a
thousand
times
and
you
could
dissolve
an
anvil
with
acids
when
you
couldn
t
stand
it
any
longer
but
there
isn
t
any
way
that
you
can
work
off
a
conscience
at
least
so
it
will
stay
worked
off
not
that
i
know
of
anyway
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
do
before
leaving
but
it
was
a
disagreeable
matter
and
i
hated
to
go
at
it
well
it
bothered
me
all
the
morning
i
could
have
mentioned
it
to
the
old
king
but
what
would
be
the
use
he
was
but
an
extinct
volcano
he
had
been
active
in
his
time
but
his
fire
was
out
this
good
while
he
was
only
a
stately
ash
pile
now
gentle
enough
and
kindly
enough
for
my
purpose
without
doubt
but
not
usable
he
was
nothing
this
so
called
king
the
queen
was
the
only
power
there
and
she
was
a
vesuvius
as
a
favor
she
might
consent
to
warm
a
flock
of
sparrows
for
you
but
then
she
might
take
that
very
opportunity
to
turn
herself
loose
and
bury
a
city
however
i
reflected
that
as
often
as
any
other
way
when
you
are
expecting
the
worst
you
get
something
that
is
not
so
bad
after
all
so
i
braced
up
and
placed
my
matter
before
her
royal
highness
i
said
i
had
been
having
a
general
jail
delivery
at
camelot
and
among
neighboring
castles
and
with
her
permission
i
would
like
to
examine
her
collection
her
bric
a
brac
that
is
to
say
her
prisoners
she
resisted
but
i
was
expecting
that
but
she
finally
consented
i
was
expecting
that
too
but
not
so
soon
that
about
ended
my
discomfort
she
called
her
guards
and
torches
and
we
went
down
into
the
dungeons
these
were
down
under
the
castle
s
foundations
and
mainly
were
small
cells
hollowed
out
of
the
living
rock
some
of
these
cells
had
no
light
at
all
in
one
of
them
was
a
woman
in
foul
rags
who
sat
on
the
ground
and
would
not
answer
a
question
or
speak
a
word
but
only
looked
up
at
us
once
or
twice
through
a
cobweb
of
tangled
hair
as
if
to
see
what
casual
thing
it
might
be
that
was
disturbing
with
sound
and
light
the
meaningless
dull
dream
that
was
become
her
life
after
that
she
sat
bowed
with
her
dirt
caked
fingers
idly
interlocked
in
her
lap
and
gave
no
further
sign
this
poor
rack
of
bones
was
a
woman
of
middle
age
apparently
but
only
apparently
she
had
been
there
nine
years
and
was
eighteen
when
she
entered
she
was
a
commoner
and
had
been
sent
here
on
her
bridal
night
by
sir
breuse
sance
pite
a
neighboring
lord
whose
vassal
her
father
was
and
to
which
said
lord
she
had
refused
what
has
since
been
called
le
droit
du
seigneur
and
moreover
had
opposed
violence
to
violence
and
spilt
half
a
gill
of
his
almost
sacred
blood
the
young
husband
had
interfered
at
that
point
believing
the
bride
s
life
in
danger
and
had
flung
the
noble
out
into
the
midst
of
the
humble
and
trembling
wedding
guests
in
the
parlor
and
left
him
there
astonished
at
this
strange
treatment
and
implacably
embittered
against
both
bride
and
groom
the
said
lord
being
cramped
for
dungeon
room
had
asked
the
queen
to
accommodate
his
two
criminals
and
here
in
her
bastile
they
had
been
ever
since
hither
indeed
they
had
come
before
their
crime
was
an
hour
old
and
had
never
seen
each
other
since
here
they
were
kenneled
like
toads
in
the
same
rock
they
had
passed
nine
pitch
dark
years
within
fifty
feet
of
each
other
yet
neither
knew
whether
the
other
was
alive
or
not
all
the
first
years
their
only
question
had
been
asked
with
beseechings
and
tears
that
might
have
moved
stones
in
time
perhaps
but
hearts
are
not
stones
is
he
alive
is
she
alive
but
they
had
never
got
an
answer
and
at
last
that
question
was
not
asked
any
more
or
any
other
i
wanted
to
see
the
man
after
hearing
all
this
he
was
thirty
four
years
old
and
looked
sixty
he
sat
upon
a
squared
block
of
stone
with
his
head
bent
down
his
forearms
resting
on
his
knees
his
long
hair
hanging
like
a
fringe
before
his
face
and
he
was
muttering
to
himself
he
raised
his
chin
and
looked
us
slowly
over
in
a
listless
dull
way
blinking
with
the
distress
of
the
torchlight
then
dropped
his
head
and
fell
to
muttering
again
and
took
no
further
notice
of
us
there
were
some
pathetically
suggestive
dumb
witnesses
present
on
his
wrists
and
ankles
were
cicatrices
old
smooth
scars
and
fastened
to
the
stone
on
which
he
sat
was
a
chain
with
manacles
and
fetters
attached
but
this
apparatus
lay
idle
on
the
ground
and
was
thick
with
rust
chains
cease
to
be
needed
after
the
spirit
has
gone
out
of
a
prisoner
i
could
not
rouse
the
man
so
i
said
we
would
take
him
to
her
and
see
to
the
bride
who
was
the
fairest
thing
in
the
earth
to
him
once
roses
pearls
and
dew
made
flesh
for
him
a
wonder
work
the
master
work
of
nature
with
eyes
like
no
other
eyes
and
voice
like
no
other
voice
and
a
freshness
and
lithe
young
grace
and
beauty
that
belonged
properly
to
the
creatures
of
dreams
as
he
thought
and
to
no
other
the
sight
of
her
would
set
his
stagnant
blood
leaping
the
sight
of
her
but
it
was
a
disappointment
they
sat
together
on
the
ground
and
looked
dimly
wondering
into
each
other
s
faces
a
while
with
a
sort
of
weak
animal
curiosity
then
forgot
each
other
s
presence
and
dropped
their
eyes
and
you
saw
that
they
were
away
again
and
wandering
in
some
far
land
of
dreams
and
shadows
that
we
know
nothing
about
i
had
them
taken
out
and
sent
to
their
friends
the
queen
did
not
like
it
much
not
that
she
felt
any
personal
interest
in
the
matter
but
she
thought
it
disrespectful
to
sir
breuse
sance
pite
however
i
assured
her
that
if
he
found
he
couldn
t
stand
it
i
would
fix
him
so
that
he
could
i
set
forty
seven
prisoners
loose
out
of
those
awful
rat
holes
and
left
only
one
in
captivity
he
was
a
lord
and
had
killed
another
lord
a
sort
of
kinsman
of
the
queen
that
other
lord
had
ambushed
him
to
assassinate
him
but
this
fellow
had
got
the
best
of
him
and
cut
his
throat
however
it
was
not
for
that
that
i
left
him
jailed
but
for
maliciously
destroying
the
only
public
well
in
one
of
his
wretched
villages
the
queen
was
bound
to
hang
him
for
killing
her
kinsman
but
i
would
not
allow
it
it
was
no
crime
to
kill
an
assassin
but
i
said
i
was
willing
to
let
her
hang
him
for
destroying
the
well
so
she
concluded
to
put
up
with
that
as
it
was
better
than
nothing
dear
me
for
what
trifling
offenses
the
most
of
those
forty
seven
men
and
women
were
shut
up
there
indeed
some
were
there
for
no
distinct
offense
at
all
but
only
to
gratify
somebody
s
spite
and
not
always
the
queen
s
by
any
means
but
a
friend
s
the
newest
prisoner
s
crime
was
a
mere
remark
which
he
had
made
he
said
he
believed
that
men
were
about
all
alike
and
one
man
as
good
as
another
barring
clothes
he
said
he
believed
that
if
you
were
to
strip
the
nation
naked
and
send
a
stranger
through
the
crowd
he
couldn
t
tell
the
king
from
a
quack
doctor
nor
a
duke
from
a
hotel
clerk
apparently
here
was
a
man
whose
brains
had
not
been
reduced
to
an
ineffectual
mush
by
idiotic
training
i
set
him
loose
and
sent
him
to
the
factory
some
of
the
cells
carved
in
the
living
rock
were
just
behind
the
face
of
the
precipice
and
in
each
of
these
an
arrow
slit
had
been
pierced
outward
to
the
daylight
and
so
the
captive
had
a
thin
ray
from
the
blessed
sun
for
his
comfort
the
case
of
one
of
these
poor
fellows
was
particularly
hard
from
his
dusky
swallow
s
hole
high
up
in
that
vast
wall
of
native
rock
he
could
peer
out
through
the
arrow
slit
and
see
his
own
home
off
yonder
in
the
valley
and
for
twenty
two
years
he
had
watched
it
with
heartache
and
longing
through
that
crack
he
could
see
the
lights
shine
there
at
night
and
in
the
daytime
he
could
see
figures
go
in
and
come
out
his
wife
and
children
some
of
them
no
doubt
though
he
could
not
make
out
at
that
distance
in
the
course
of
years
he
noted
festivities
there
and
tried
to
rejoice
and
wondered
if
they
were
weddings
or
what
they
might
be
and
he
noted
funerals
and
they
wrung
his
heart
he
could
make
out
the
coffin
but
he
could
not
determine
its
size
and
so
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
wife
or
child
he
could
see
the
procession
form
with
priests
and
mourners
and
move
solemnly
away
bearing
the
secret
with
them
he
had
left
behind
him
five
children
and
a
wife
and
in
nineteen
years
he
had
seen
five
funerals
issue
and
none
of
them
humble
enough
in
pomp
to
denote
a
servant
so
he
had
lost
five
of
his
treasures
there
must
still
be
one
remaining
one
now
infinitely
unspeakably
precious
but
which
one
wife
or
child
that
was
the
question
that
tortured
him
by
night
and
by
day
asleep
and
awake
well
to
have
an
interest
of
some
sort
and
half
a
ray
of
light
when
you
are
in
a
dungeon
is
a
great
support
to
the
body
and
preserver
of
the
intellect
this
man
was
in
pretty
good
condition
yet
by
the
time
he
had
finished
telling
me
his
distressful
tale
i
was
in
the
same
state
of
mind
that
you
would
have
been
in
yourself
if
you
have
got
average
human
curiosity
that
is
to
say
i
was
as
burning
up
as
he
was
to
find
out
which
member
of
the
family
it
was
that
was
left
so
i
took
him
over
home
myself
and
an
amazing
kind
of
a
surprise
party
it
was
too
typhoons
and
cyclones
of
frantic
joy
and
whole
niagaras
of
happy
tears
and
by
george
we
found
the
aforetime
young
matron
graying
toward
the
imminent
verge
of
her
half
century
and
the
babies
all
men
and
women
and
some
of
them
married
and
experimenting
familywise
