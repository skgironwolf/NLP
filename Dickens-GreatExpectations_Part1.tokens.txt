chapter
i
my
father
s
family
name
being
pirrip
and
my
christian
name
philip
my
infant
tongue
could
make
of
both
names
nothing
longer
or
more
explicit
than
pip
so
i
called
myself
pip
and
came
to
be
called
pip
i
give
pirrip
as
my
father
s
family
name
on
the
authority
of
his
tombstone
and
my
sister
mrs
joe
gargery
who
married
the
blacksmith
as
i
never
saw
my
father
or
my
mother
and
never
saw
any
likeness
of
either
of
them
for
their
days
were
long
before
the
days
of
photographs
my
first
fancies
regarding
what
they
were
like
were
unreasonably
derived
from
their
tombstones
the
shape
of
the
letters
on
my
father
s
gave
me
an
odd
idea
that
he
was
a
square
stout
dark
man
with
curly
black
hair
from
the
character
and
turn
of
the
inscription
also
georgiana
wife
of
the
above
i
drew
a
childish
conclusion
that
my
mother
was
freckled
and
sickly
to
five
little
stone
lozenges
each
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
which
were
arranged
in
a
neat
row
beside
their
grave
and
were
sacred
to
the
memory
of
five
little
brothers
of
mine
who
gave
up
trying
to
get
a
living
exceedingly
early
in
that
universal
struggle
i
am
indebted
for
a
belief
i
religiously
entertained
that
they
had
all
been
born
on
their
backs
with
their
hands
in
their
trousers
pockets
and
had
never
taken
them
out
in
this
state
of
existence
ours
was
the
marsh
country
down
by
the
river
within
as
the
river
wound
twenty
miles
of
the
sea
my
first
most
vivid
and
broad
impression
of
the
identity
of
things
seems
to
me
to
have
been
gained
on
a
memorable
raw
afternoon
towards
evening
at
such
a
time
i
found
out
for
certain
that
this
bleak
place
overgrown
with
nettles
was
the
churchyard
and
that
philip
pirrip
late
of
this
parish
and
also
georgiana
wife
of
the
above
were
dead
and
buried
and
that
alexander
bartholomew
abraham
tobias
and
roger
infant
children
of
the
aforesaid
were
also
dead
and
buried
and
that
the
dark
flat
wilderness
beyond
the
churchyard
intersected
with
dikes
and
mounds
and
gates
with
scattered
cattle
feeding
on
it
was
the
marshes
and
that
the
low
leaden
line
beyond
was
the
river
and
that
the
distant
savage
lair
from
which
the
wind
was
rushing
was
the
sea
and
that
the
small
bundle
of
shivers
growing
afraid
of
it
all
and
beginning
to
cry
was
pip
hold
your
noise
cried
a
terrible
voice
as
a
man
started
up
from
among
the
graves
at
the
side
of
the
church
porch
keep
still
you
little
devil
or
i
ll
cut
your
throat
a
fearful
man
all
in
coarse
gray
with
a
great
iron
on
his
leg
a
man
with
no
hat
and
with
broken
shoes
and
with
an
old
rag
tied
round
his
head
a
man
who
had
been
soaked
in
water
and
smothered
in
mud
and
lamed
by
stones
and
cut
by
flints
and
stung
by
nettles
and
torn
by
briars
who
limped
and
shivered
and
glared
and
growled
and
whose
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
as
he
seized
me
by
the
chin
oh
don
t
cut
my
throat
sir
i
pleaded
in
terror
pray
don
t
do
it
sir
tell
us
your
name
said
the
man
quick
pip
sir
once
more
said
the
man
staring
at
me
give
it
mouth
pip
pip
sir
show
us
where
you
live
said
the
man
pint
out
the
place
i
pointed
to
where
our
village
lay
on
the
flat
in
shore
among
the
alder
trees
and
pollards
a
mile
or
more
from
the
church
the
man
after
looking
at
me
for
a
moment
turned
me
upside
down
and
emptied
my
pockets
there
was
nothing
in
them
but
a
piece
of
bread
when
the
church
came
to
itself
for
he
was
so
sudden
and
strong
that
he
made
it
go
head
over
heels
before
me
and
i
saw
the
steeple
under
my
feet
when
the
church
came
to
itself
i
say
i
was
seated
on
a
high
tombstone
trembling
while
he
ate
the
bread
ravenously
you
young
dog
said
the
man
licking
his
lips
what
fat
cheeks
you
ha
got
i
believe
they
were
fat
though
i
was
at
that
time
undersized
for
my
years
and
not
strong
darn
me
if
i
couldn
t
eat
em
said
the
man
with
a
threatening
shake
of
his
head
and
if
i
han
t
half
a
mind
to
t
i
earnestly
expressed
my
hope
that
he
wouldn
t
and
held
tighter
to
the
tombstone
on
which
he
had
put
me
partly
to
keep
myself
upon
it
partly
to
keep
myself
from
crying
now
lookee
here
said
the
man
where
s
your
mother
there
sir
said
i
he
started
made
a
short
run
and
stopped
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
there
sir
i
timidly
explained
also
georgiana
that
s
my
mother
oh
said
he
coming
back
and
is
that
your
father
alonger
your
mother
yes
sir
said
i
him
too
late
of
this
parish
ha
he
muttered
then
considering
who
d
ye
live
with
supposin
you
re
kindly
let
to
live
which
i
han
t
made
up
my
mind
about
my
sister
sir
mrs
joe
gargery
wife
of
joe
gargery
the
blacksmith
sir
blacksmith
eh
said
he
and
looked
down
at
his
leg
after
darkly
looking
at
his
leg
and
me
several
times
he
came
closer
to
my
tombstone
took
me
by
both
arms
and
tilted
me
back
as
far
as
he
could
hold
me
so
that
his
eyes
looked
most
powerfully
down
into
mine
and
mine
looked
most
helplessly
up
into
his
now
lookee
here
he
said
the
question
being
whether
you
re
to
be
let
to
live
you
know
what
a
file
is
yes
sir
and
you
know
what
wittles
is
yes
sir
after
each
question
he
tilted
me
over
a
little
more
so
as
to
give
me
a
greater
sense
of
helplessness
and
danger
you
get
me
a
file
he
tilted
me
again
and
you
get
me
wittles
he
tilted
me
again
you
bring
em
both
to
me
he
tilted
me
again
or
i
ll
have
your
heart
and
liver
out
he
tilted
me
again
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
and
so
giddy
that
i
clung
to
him
with
both
hands
and
said
if
you
would
kindly
please
to
let
me
keep
upright
sir
perhaps
i
shouldn
t
be
sick
and
perhaps
i
could
attend
more
he
gave
me
a
most
tremendous
dip
and
roll
so
that
the
church
jumped
over
its
own
weathercock
then
he
held
me
by
the
arms
in
an
upright
position
on
the
top
of
the
stone
and
went
on
in
these
fearful
terms
you
bring
me
to
morrow
morning
early
that
file
and
them
wittles
you
bring
the
lot
to
me
at
that
old
battery
over
yonder
you
do
it
and
you
never
dare
to
say
a
word
or
dare
to
make
a
sign
concerning
your
having
seen
such
a
person
as
me
or
any
person
sumever
and
you
shall
be
let
to
live
you
fail
or
you
go
from
my
words
in
any
partickler

matter
how
small
it
is
and
your
heart
and
your
liver
shall
be
tore
out
roasted
and
ate
now
i
ain
t
alone
as
you
may
think
i
am
there
s
a
young
man
hid
with
me
in
comparison
with
which
young
man
i
am
a
angel
that
young
man
hears
the
words
i
speak
that
young
man
has
a
secret
way
pecooliar
to
himself
of
getting
at
a
boy
and
at
his
heart
and
at
his
liver
it
is
in
wain
for
a
boy
to
attempt
to
hide
himself
from
that
young
man
a
boy
may
lock
his
door
may
be
warm
in
bed
may
tuck
himself
up
may
draw
the
clothes
over
his
head
may
think
himself
comfortable
and
safe
but
that
young
man
will
softly
creep
and
creep
his
way
to
him
and
tear
him
open
i
am
a
keeping
that
young
man
from
harming
of
you
at
the
present
moment
with
great
difficulty
i
find
it
wery
hard
to
hold
that
young
man
off
of
your
inside
now
what
do
you
say
i
said
that
i
would
get
him
the
file
and
i
would
get
him
what
broken
bits
of
food
i
could
and
i
would
come
to
him
at
the
battery
early
in
the
morning
say
lord
strike
you
dead
if
you
don
t
said
the
man
i
said
so
and
he
took
me
down
now
he
pursued
you
remember
what
you
ve
undertook
and
you
remember
that
young
man
and
you
get
home
goo
good
night
sir
i
faltered
much
of
that
said
he
glancing
about
him
over
the
cold
wet
flat
i
wish
i
was
a
frog
or
a
eel
at
the
same
time
he
hugged
his
shuddering
body
in
both
his
arms
clasping
himself
as
if
to
hold
himself
together
and
limped
towards
the
low
church
wall
as
i
saw
him
go
picking
his
way
among
the
nettles
and
among
the
brambles
that
bound
the
green
mounds
he
looked
in
my
young
eyes
as
if
he
were
eluding
the
hands
of
the
dead
people
stretching
up
cautiously
out
of
their
graves
to
get
a
twist
upon
his
ankle
and
pull
him
in
when
he
came
to
the
low
church
wall
he
got
over
it
like
a
man
whose
legs
were
numbed
and
stiff
and
then
turned
round
to
look
for
me
when
i
saw
him
turning
i
set
my
face
towards
home
and
made
the
best
use
of
my
legs
but
presently
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
and
saw
him
going
on
again
towards
the
river
still
hugging
himself
in
both
arms
and
picking
his
way
with
his
sore
feet
among
the
great
stones
dropped
into
the
marshes
here
and
there
for
stepping
places
when
the
rains
were
heavy
or
the
tide
was
in
the
marshes
were
just
a
long
black
horizontal
line
then
as
i
stopped
to
look
after
him
and
the
river
was
just
another
horizontal
line
not
nearly
so
broad
nor
yet
so
black
and
the
sky
was
just
a
row
of
long
angry
red
lines
and
dense
black
lines
intermixed
on
the
edge
of
the
river
i
could
faintly
make
out
the
only
two
black
things
in
all
the
prospect
that
seemed
to
be
standing
upright
one
of
these
was
the
beacon
by
which
the
sailors
steered
like
an
unhooped
cask
upon
a
pole
an
ugly
thing
when
you
were
near
it
the
other
a
gibbet
with
some
chains
hanging
to
it
which
had
once
held
a
pirate
the
man
was
limping
on
towards
this
latter
as
if
he
were
the
pirate
come
to
life
and
come
down
and
going
back
to
hook
himself
up
again
it
gave
me
a
terrible
turn
when
i
thought
so
and
as
i
saw
the
cattle
lifting
their
heads
to
gaze
after
him
i
wondered
whether
they
thought
so
too
i
looked
all
round
for
the
horrible
young
man
and
could
see
no
signs
of
him
but
now
i
was
frightened
again
and
ran
home
without
stopping
chapter
ii
my
sister
mrs
joe
gargery
was
more
than
twenty
years
older
than
i
and
had
established
a
great
reputation
with
herself
and
the
neighbors
because
she
had
brought
me
up
by
hand
having
at
that
time
to
find
out
for
myself
what
the
expression
meant
and
knowing
her
to
have
a
hard
and
heavy
hand
and
to
be
much
in
the
habit
of
laying
it
upon
her
husband
as
well
as
upon
me
i
supposed
that
joe
gargery
and
i
were
both
brought
up
by
hand
she
was
not
a
good
looking
woman
my
sister
and
i
had
a
general
impression
that
she
must
have
made
joe
gargery
marry
her
by
hand
joe
was
a
fair
man
with
curls
of
flaxen
hair
on
each
side
of
his
smooth
face
and
with
eyes
of
such
a
very
undecided
blue
that
they
seemed
to
have
somehow
got
mixed
with
their
own
whites
he
was
a
mild
good
natured
sweet
tempered
easy
going
foolish
dear
fellow
a
sort
of
hercules
in
strength
and
also
in
weakness
my
sister
mrs
joe
with
black
hair
and
eyes
had
such
a
prevailing
redness
of
skin
that
i
sometimes
used
to
wonder
whether
it
was
possible
she
washed
herself
with
a
nutmeg
grater
instead
of
soap
she
was
tall
and
bony
and
almost
always
wore
a
coarse
apron
fastened
over
her
figure
behind
with
two
loops
and
having
a
square
impregnable
bib
in
front
that
was
stuck
full
of
pins
and
needles
she
made
it
a
powerful
merit
in
herself
and
a
strong
reproach
against
joe
that
she
wore
this
apron
so
much
though
i
really
see
no
reason
why
she
should
have
worn
it
at
all
or
why
if
she
did
wear
it
at
all
she
should
not
have
taken
it
off
every
day
of
her
life
joe
s
forge
adjoined
our
house
which
was
a
wooden
house
as
many
of
the
dwellings
in
our
country
were
most
of
them
at
that
time
when
i
ran
home
from
the
churchyard
the
forge
was
shut
up
and
joe
was
sitting
alone
in
the
kitchen
joe
and
i
being
fellow
sufferers
and
having
confidences
as
such
joe
imparted
a
confidence
to
me
the
moment
i
raised
the
latch
of
the
door
and
peeped
in
at
him
opposite
to
it
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
mrs
joe
has
been
out
a
dozen
times
looking
for
you
pip
and
she
s
out
now
making
it
a
baker
s
dozen
is
she
yes
pip
said
joe
and
what
s
worse
she
s
got
tickler
with
her
at
this
dismal
intelligence
i
twisted
the
only
button
on
my
waistcoat
round
and
round
and
looked
in
great
depression
at
the
fire
tickler
was
a
wax
ended
piece
of
cane
worn
smooth
by
collision
with
my
tickled
frame
she
sot
down
said
joe
and
she
got
up
and
she
made
a
grab
at
tickler
and
she
ram
paged
out
that
s
what
she
did
said
joe
slowly
clearing
the
fire
between
the
lower
bars
with
the
poker
and
looking
at
it
she
ram
paged
out
pip
has
she
been
gone
long
joe
i
always
treated
him
as
a
larger
species
of
child
and
as
no
more
than
my
equal
well
said
joe
glancing
up
at
the
dutch
clock
she
s
been
on
the
ram
page
this
last
spell
about
five
minutes
pip
she
s
a
coming
get
behind
the
door
old
chap
and
have
the
jack
towel
betwixt
you
i
took
the
advice
my
sister
mrs
joe
throwing
the
door
wide
open
and
finding
an
obstruction
behind
it
immediately
divined
the
cause
and
applied
tickler
to
its
further
investigation
she
concluded
by
throwing
me
i
often
served
as
a
connubial
missile
at
joe
who
glad
to
get
hold
of
me
on
any
terms
passed
me
on
into
the
chimney
and
quietly
fenced
me
up
there
with
his
great
leg
where
have
you
been
you
young
monkey
said
mrs
joe
stamping
her
foot
tell
me
directly
what
you
ve
been
doing
to
wear
me
away
with
fret
and
fright
and
worrit
or
i
d
have
you
out
of
that
corner
if
you
was
fifty
pips
and
he
was
five
hundred
gargerys
i
have
only
been
to
the
churchyard
said
i
from
my
stool
crying
and
rubbing
myself
churchyard
repeated
my
sister
if
it
warn
t
for
me
you
d
have
been
to
the
churchyard
long
ago
and
stayed
there
who
brought
you
up
by
hand
you
did
said
i
and
why
did
i
do
it
i
should
like
to
know
exclaimed
my
sister
i
whimpered
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
said
my
sister
i
d
never
do
it
again
i
know
that
i
may
truly
say
i
ve
never
had
this
apron
of
mine
off
since
born
you
were
it
s
bad
enough
to
be
a
blacksmith
s
wife
and
him
a
gargery
without
being
your
mother
my
thoughts
strayed
from
that
question
as
i
looked
disconsolately
at
the
fire
for
the
fugitive
out
on
the
marshes
with
the
ironed
leg
the
mysterious
young
man
the
file
the
food
and
the
dreadful
pledge
i
was
under
to
commit
a
larceny
on
those
sheltering
premises
rose
before
me
in
the
avenging
coals
hah
said
mrs
joe
restoring
tickler
to
his
station
churchyard
indeed
you
may
well
say
churchyard
you
two
one
of
us
by
the
by
had
not
said
it
at
all
you
ll
drive
me
to
the
churchyard
betwixt
you
one
of
these
days
and
o
a
pr
r
recious
pair
you
d
be
without
me
as
she
applied
herself
to
set
the
tea
things
joe
peeped
down
at
me
over
his
leg
as
if
he
were
mentally
casting
me
and
himself
up
and
calculating
what
kind
of
pair
we
practically
should
make
under
the
grievous
circumstances
foreshadowed
after
that
he
sat
feeling
his
right
side
flaxen
curls
and
whisker
and
following
mrs
joe
about
with
his
blue
eyes
as
his
manner
always
was
at
squally
times
my
sister
had
a
trenchant
way
of
cutting
our
bread
and
butter
for
us
that
never
varied
first
with
her
left
hand
she
jammed
the
loaf
hard
and
fast
against
her
bib
where
it
sometimes
got
a
pin
into
it
and
sometimes
a
needle
which
we
afterwards
got
into
our
mouths
then
she
took
some
butter
not
too
much
on
a
knife
and
spread
it
on
the
loaf
in
an
apothecary
kind
of
way
as
if
she
were
making
a
plaster
using
both
sides
of
the
knife
with
a
slapping
dexterity
and
trimming
and
moulding
the
butter
off
round
the
crust
then
she
gave
the
knife
a
final
smart
wipe
on
the
edge
of
the
plaster
and
then
sawed
a
very
thick
round
off
the
loaf
which
she
finally
before
separating
from
the
loaf
hewed
into
two
halves
of
which
joe
got
one
and
i
the
other
on
the
present
occasion
though
i
was
hungry
i
dared
not
eat
my
slice
i
felt
that
i
must
have
something
in
reserve
for
my
dreadful
acquaintance
and
his
ally
the
still
more
dreadful
young
man
i
knew
mrs
joe
s
housekeeping
to
be
of
the
strictest
kind
and
that
my
larcenous
researches
might
find
nothing
available
in
the
safe
therefore
i
resolved
to
put
my
hunk
of
bread
and
butter
down
the
leg
of
my
trousers
the
effort
of
resolution
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
this
purpose
i
found
to
be
quite
awful
it
was
as
if
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
leap
from
the
top
of
a
high
house
or
plunge
into
a
great
depth
of
water
and
it
was
made
the
more
difficult
by
the
unconscious
joe
in
our
already
mentioned
freemasonry
as
fellow
sufferers
and
in
his
good
natured
companionship
with
me
it
was
our
evening
habit
to
compare
the
way
we
bit
through
our
slices
by
silently
holding
them
up
to
each
other
s
admiration
now
and
then
which
stimulated
us
to
new
exertions
to
night
joe
several
times
invited
me
by
the
display
of
his
fast
diminishing
slice
to
enter
upon
our
usual
friendly
competition
but
he
found
me
each
time
with
my
yellow
mug
of
tea
on
one
knee
and
my
untouched
bread
and
butter
on
the
other
at
last
i
desperately
considered
that
the
thing
i
contemplated
must
be
done
and
that
it
had
best
be
done
in
the
least
improbable
manner
consistent
with
the
circumstances
i
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
joe
had
just
looked
at
me
and
got
my
bread
and
butter
down
my
leg
joe
was
evidently
made
uncomfortable
by
what
he
supposed
to
be
my
loss
of
appetite
and
took
a
thoughtful
bite
out
of
his
slice
which
he
didn
t
seem
to
enjoy
he
turned
it
about
in
his
mouth
much
longer
than
usual
pondering
over
it
a
good
deal
and
after
all
gulped
it
down
like
a
pill
he
was
about
to
take
another
bite
and
had
just
got
his
head
on
one
side
for
a
good
purchase
on
it
when
his
eye
fell
on
me
and
he
saw
that
my
bread
and
butter
was
gone
the
wonder
and
consternation
with
which
joe
stopped
on
the
threshold
of
his
bite
and
stared
at
me
were
too
evident
to
escape
my
sister
s
observation
what
s
the
matter
now
said
she
smartly
as
she
put
down
her
cup
i
say
you
know
muttered
joe
shaking
his
head
at
me
in
very
serious
remonstrance
pip
old
chap
you
ll
do
yourself
a
mischief
it
ll
stick
somewhere
you
can
t
have
chawed
it
pip
what
s
the
matter
now
repeated
my
sister
more
sharply
than
before
if
you
can
cough
any
trifle
on
it
up
pip
i
d
recommend
you
to
do
it
said
joe
all
aghast
manners
is
manners
but
still
your
elth
s
your
elth
by
this
time
my
sister
was
quite
desperate
so
she
pounced
on
joe
and
taking
him
by
the
two
whiskers
knocked
his
head
for
a
little
while
against
the
wall
behind
him
while
i
sat
in
the
corner
looking
guiltily
on
now
perhaps
you
ll
mention
what
s
the
matter
said
my
sister
out
of
breath
you
staring
great
stuck
pig
joe
looked
at
her
in
a
helpless
way
then
took
a
helpless
bite
and
looked
at
me
again
you
know
pip
said
joe
solemnly
with
his
last
bite
in
his
cheek
and
speaking
in
a
confidential
voice
as
if
we
two
were
quite
alone
you
and
me
is
always
friends
and
i
d
be
the
last
to
tell
upon
you
any
time
but
such
a
he
moved
his
chair
and
looked
about
the
floor
between
us
and
then
again
at
me
such
a
most
oncommon
bolt
as
that
been
bolting
his
food
has
he
cried
my
sister
you
know
old
chap
said
joe
looking
at
me
and
not
at
mrs
joe
with
his
bite
still
in
his
cheek
i
bolted
myself
when
i
was
your
age
frequent
and
as
a
boy
i
ve
been
among
a
many
bolters
but
i
never
see
your
bolting
equal
yet
pip
and
it
s
a
mercy
you
ain
t
bolted
dead
my
sister
made
a
dive
at
me
and
fished
me
up
by
the
hair
saying
nothing
more
than
the
awful
words
you
come
along
and
be
dosed
some
medical
beast
had
revived
tar
water
in
those
days
as
a
fine
medicine
and
mrs
joe
always
kept
a
supply
of
it
in
the
cupboard
having
a
belief
in
its
virtues
correspondent
to
its
nastiness
at
the
best
of
times
so
much
of
this
elixir
was
administered
to
me
as
a
choice
restorative
that
i
was
conscious
of
going
about
smelling
like
a
new
fence
on
this
particular
evening
the
urgency
of
my
case
demanded
a
pint
of
this
mixture
which
was
poured
down
my
throat
for
my
greater
comfort
while
mrs
joe
held
my
head
under
her
arm
as
a
boot
would
be
held
in
a
bootjack
joe
got
off
with
half
a
pint
but
was
made
to
swallow
that
much
to
his
disturbance
as
he
sat
slowly
munching
and
meditating
before
the
fire
because
he
had
had
a
turn
judging
from
myself
i
should
say
he
certainly
had
a
turn
afterwards
if
he
had
had
none
before
conscience
is
a
dreadful
thing
when
it
accuses
man
or
boy
but
when
in
the
case
of
a
boy
that
secret
burden
co
operates
with
another
secret
burden
down
the
leg
of
his
trousers
it
is
as
i
can
testify
a
great
punishment
the
guilty
knowledge
that
i
was
going
to
rob
mrs
joe
i
never
thought
i
was
going
to
rob
joe
for
i
never
thought
of
any
of
the
housekeeping
property
as
his
united
to
the
necessity
of
always
keeping
one
hand
on
my
bread
and
butter
as
i
sat
or
when
i
was
ordered
about
the
kitchen
on
any
small
errand
almost
drove
me
out
of
my
mind
then
as
the
marsh
winds
made
the
fire
glow
and
flare
i
thought
i
heard
the
voice
outside
of
the
man
with
the
iron
on
his
leg
who
had
sworn
me
to
secrecy
declaring
that
he
couldn
t
and
wouldn
t
starve
until
to
morrow
but
must
be
fed
now
at
other
times
i
thought
what
if
the
young
man
who
was
with
so
much
difficulty
restrained
from
imbruing
his
hands
in
me
should
yield
to
a
constitutional
impatience
or
should
mistake
the
time
and
should
think
himself
accredited
to
my
heart
and
liver
to
night
instead
of
to
morrow
if
ever
anybody
s
hair
stood
on
end
with
terror
mine
must
have
done
so
then
but
perhaps
nobody
s
ever
did
it
was
christmas
eve
and
i
had
to
stir
the
pudding
for
next
day
with
a
copper
stick
from
seven
to
eight
by
the
dutch
clock
i
tried
it
with
the
load
upon
my
leg
and
that
made
me
think
afresh
of
the
man
with
the
load
on
his
leg
and
found
the
tendency
of
exercise
to
bring
the
bread
and
butter
out
at
my
ankle
quite
unmanageable
happily
i
slipped
away
and
deposited
that
part
of
my
conscience
in
my
garret
bedroom
hark
said
i
when
i
had
done
my
stirring
and
was
taking
a
final
warm
in
the
chimney
corner
before
being
sent
up
to
bed
was
that
great
guns
joe
ah
said
joe
there
s
another
conwict
off
what
does
that
mean
joe
said
i
mrs
joe
who
always
took
explanations
upon
herself
said
snappishly
escaped
escaped
administering
the
definition
like
tar
water
while
mrs
joe
sat
with
her
head
bending
over
her
needlework
i
put
my
mouth
into
the
forms
of
saying
to
joe
what
s
a
convict
joe
put
his
mouth
into
the
forms
of
returning
such
a
highly
elaborate
answer
that
i
could
make
out
nothing
of
it
but
the
single
word
pip
there
was
a
conwict
off
last
night
said
joe
aloud
after
sunset
gun
and
they
fired
warning
of
him
and
now
it
appears
they
re
firing
warning
of
another
who
s
firing
said
i
drat
that
boy
interposed
my
sister
frowning
at
me
over
her
work
what
a
questioner
he
is
ask
no
questions
and
you
ll
be
told
no
lies
it
was
not
very
polite
to
herself
i
thought
to
imply
that
i
should
be
told
lies
by
her
even
if
i
did
ask
questions
but
she
never
was
polite
unless
there
was
company
at
this
point
joe
greatly
augmented
my
curiosity
by
taking
the
utmost
pains
to
open
his
mouth
very
wide
and
to
put
it
into
the
form
of
a
word
that
looked
to
me
like
sulks
therefore
i
naturally
pointed
to
mrs
joe
and
put
my
mouth
into
the
form
of
saying
her
but
joe
wouldn
t
hear
of
that
at
all
and
again
opened
his
mouth
very
wide
and
shook
the
form
of
a
most
emphatic
word
out
of
it
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
the
word
mrs
joe
said
i
as
a
last
resort
i
should
like
to
know
if
you
wouldn
t
much
mind
where
the
firing
comes
from
lord
bless
the
boy
exclaimed
my
sister
as
if
she
didn
t
quite
mean
that
but
rather
the
contrary
from
the
hulks
oh
h
said
i
looking
at
joe
hulks
joe
gave
a
reproachful
cough
as
much
as
to
say
well
i
told
you
so
and
please
what
s
hulks
said
i
that
s
the
way
with
this
boy
exclaimed
my
sister
pointing
me
out
with
her
needle
and
thread
and
shaking
her
head
at
me
answer
him
one
question
and
he
ll
ask
you
a
dozen
directly
hulks
are
prison
ships
right
cross
th
meshes
we
always
used
that
name
for
marshes
in
our
country
i
wonder
who
s
put
into
prison
ships
and
why
they
re
put
there
said
i
in
a
general
way
and
with
quiet
desperation
it
was
too
much
for
mrs
joe
who
immediately
rose
i
tell
you
what
young
fellow
said
she
i
didn
t
bring
you
up
by
hand
to
badger
people
s
lives
out
it
would
be
blame
to
me
and
not
praise
if
i
had
people
are
put
in
the
hulks
because
they
murder
and
because
they
rob
and
forge
and
do
all
sorts
of
bad
and
they
always
begin
by
asking
questions
now
you
get
along
to
bed
i
was
never
allowed
a
candle
to
light
me
to
bed
and
as
i
went
up
stairs
in
the
dark
with
my
head
tingling
from
mrs
joe
s
thimble
having
played
the
tambourine
upon
it
to
accompany
her
last
words
i
felt
fearfully
sensible
of
the
great
convenience
that
the
hulks
were
handy
for
me
i
was
clearly
on
my
way
there
i
had
begun
by
asking
questions
and
i
was
going
to
rob
mrs
joe
since
that
time
which
is
far
enough
away
now
i
have
often
thought
that
few
people
know
what
secrecy
there
is
in
the
young
under
terror
no
matter
how
unreasonable
the
terror
so
that
it
be
terror
i
was
in
mortal
terror
of
the
young
man
who
wanted
my
heart
and
liver
i
was
in
mortal
terror
of
my
interlocutor
with
the
iron
leg
i
was
in
mortal
terror
of
myself
from
whom
an
awful
promise
had
been
extracted
i
had
no
hope
of
deliverance
through
my
all
powerful
sister
who
repulsed
me
at
every
turn
i
am
afraid
to
think
of
what
i
might
have
done
on
requirement
in
the
secrecy
of
my
terror
if
i
slept
at
all
that
night
it
was
only
to
imagine
myself
drifting
down
the
river
on
a
strong
spring
tide
to
the
hulks
a
ghostly
pirate
calling
out
to
me
through
a
speaking
trumpet
as
i
passed
the
gibbet
station
that
i
had
better
come
ashore
and
be
hanged
there
at
once
and
not
put
it
off
i
was
afraid
to
sleep
even
if
i
had
been
inclined
for
i
knew
that
at
the
first
faint
dawn
of
morning
i
must
rob
the
pantry
there
was
no
doing
it
in
the
night
for
there
was
no
getting
a
light
by
easy
friction
then
to
have
got
one
i
must
have
struck
it
out
of
flint
and
steel
and
have
made
a
noise
like
the
very
pirate
himself
rattling
his
chains
as
soon
as
the
great
black
velvet
pall
outside
my
little
window
was
shot
with
gray
i
got
up
and
went
down
stairs
every
board
upon
the
way
and
every
crack
in
every
board
calling
after
me
stop
thief
and
get
up
mrs
joe
in
the
pantry
which
was
far
more
abundantly
supplied
than
usual
owing
to
the
season
i
was
very
much
alarmed
by
a
hare
hanging
up
by
the
heels
whom
i
rather
thought
i
caught
when
my
back
was
half
turned
winking
i
had
no
time
for
verification
no
time
for
selection
no
time
for
anything
for
i
had
no
time
to
spare
i
stole
some
bread
some
rind
of
cheese
about
half
a
jar
of
mincemeat
which
i
tied
up
in
my
pocket
handkerchief
with
my
last
night
s
slice
some
brandy
from
a
stone
bottle
which
i
decanted
into
a
glass
bottle
i
had
secretly
used
for
making
that
intoxicating
fluid
spanish
liquorice
water
up
in
my
room
diluting
the
stone
bottle
from
a
jug
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
a
meat
bone
with
very
little
on
it
and
a
beautiful
round
compact
pork
pie
i
was
nearly
going
away
without
the
pie
but
i
was
tempted
to
mount
upon
a
shelf
to
look
what
it
was
that
was
put
away
so
carefully
in
a
covered
earthen
ware
dish
in
a
corner
and
i
found
it
was
the
pie
and
i
took
it
in
the
hope
that
it
was
not
intended
for
early
use
and
would
not
be
missed
for
some
time
there
was
a
door
in
the
kitchen
communicating
with
the
forge
i
unlocked
and
unbolted
that
door
and
got
a
file
from
among
joe
s
tools
then
i
put
the
fastenings
as
i
had
found
them
opened
the
door
at
which
i
had
entered
when
i
ran
home
last
night
shut
it
and
ran
for
the
misty
marshes
chapter
iii
it
was
a
rimy
morning
and
very
damp
i
had
seen
the
damp
lying
on
the
outside
of
my
little
window
as
if
some
goblin
had
been
crying
there
all
night
and
using
the
window
for
a
pocket
handkerchief
now
i
saw
the
damp
lying
on
the
bare
hedges
and
spare
grass
like
a
coarser
sort
of
spiders
webs
hanging
itself
from
twig
to
twig
and
blade
to
blade
on
every
rail
and
gate
wet
lay
clammy
and
the
marsh
mist
was
so
thick
that
the
wooden
finger
on
the
post
directing
people
to
our
village
a
direction
which
they
never
accepted
for
they
never
came
there
was
invisible
to
me
until
i
was
quite
close
under
it
then
as
i
looked
up
at
it
while
it
dripped
it
seemed
to
my
oppressed
conscience
like
a
phantom
devoting
me
to
the
hulks
the
mist
was
heavier
yet
when
i
got
out
upon
the
marshes
so
that
instead
of
my
running
at
everything
everything
seemed
to
run
at
me
this
was
very
disagreeable
to
a
guilty
mind
the
gates
and
dikes
and
banks
came
bursting
at
me
through
the
mist
as
if
they
cried
as
plainly
as
could
be
a
boy
with
somebody
s
else
s
pork
pie
stop
him
the
cattle
came
upon
me
with
like
suddenness
staring
out
of
their
eyes
and
steaming
out
of
their
nostrils
halloa
young
thief
one
black
ox
with
a
white
cravat
on
who
even
had
to
my
awakened
conscience
something
of
a
clerical
air
fixed
me
so
obstinately
with
his
eyes
and
moved
his
blunt
head
round
in
such
an
accusatory
manner
as
i
moved
round
that
i
blubbered
out
to
him
i
couldn
t
help
it
sir
it
wasn
t
for
myself
i
took
it
upon
which
he
put
down
his
head
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
out
of
his
nose
and
vanished
with
a
kick
up
of
his
hind
legs
and
a
flourish
of
his
tail
all
this
time
i
was
getting
on
towards
the
river
but
however
fast
i
went
i
couldn
t
warm
my
feet
to
which
the
damp
cold
seemed
riveted
as
the
iron
was
riveted
to
the
leg
of
the
man
i
was
running
to
meet
i
knew
my
way
to
the
battery
pretty
straight
for
i
had
been
down
there
on
a
sunday
with
joe
and
joe
sitting
on
an
old
gun
had
told
me
that
when
i
was
prentice
to
him
regularly
bound
we
would
have
such
larks
there
however
in
the
confusion
of
the
mist
i
found
myself
at
last
too
far
to
the
right
and
consequently
had
to
try
back
along
the
river
side
on
the
bank
of
loose
stones
above
the
mud
and
the
stakes
that
staked
the
tide
out
making
my
way
along
here
with
all
despatch
i
had
just
crossed
a
ditch
which
i
knew
to
be
very
near
the
battery
and
had
just
scrambled
up
the
mound
beyond
the
ditch
when
i
saw
the
man
sitting
before
me
his
back
was
towards
me
and
he
had
his
arms
folded
and
was
nodding
forward
heavy
with
sleep
i
thought
he
would
be
more
glad
if
i
came
upon
him
with
his
breakfast
in
that
unexpected
manner
so
i
went
forward
softly
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
instantly
jumped
up
and
it
was
not
the
same
man
but
another
man
and
yet
this
man
was
dressed
in
coarse
gray
too
and
had
a
great
iron
on
his
leg
and
was
lame
and
hoarse
and
cold
and
was
everything
that
the
other
man
was
except
that
he
had
not
the
same
face
and
had
a
flat
broad
brimmed
low
crowned
felt
hat
on
all
this
i
saw
in
a
moment
for
i
had
only
a
moment
to
see
it
in
he
swore
an
oath
at
me
made
a
hit
at
me
it
was
a
round
weak
blow
that
missed
me
and
almost
knocked
himself
down
for
it
made
him
stumble
and
then
he
ran
into
the
mist
stumbling
twice
as
he
went
and
i
lost
him
it
s
the
young
man
i
thought
feeling
my
heart
shoot
as
i
identified
him
i
dare
say
i
should
have
felt
a
pain
in
my
liver
too
if
i
had
known
where
it
was
i
was
soon
at
the
battery
after
that
and
there
was
the
right
man
hugging
himself
and
limping
to
and
fro
as
if
he
had
never
all
night
left
off
hugging
and
limping
waiting
for
me
he
was
awfully
cold
to
be
sure
i
half
expected
to
see
him
drop
down
before
my
face
and
die
of
deadly
cold
his
eyes
looked
so
awfully
hungry
too
that
when
i
handed
him
the
file
and
he
laid
it
down
on
the
grass
it
occurred
to
me
he
would
have
tried
to
eat
it
if
he
had
not
seen
my
bundle
he
did
not
turn
me
upside
down
this
time
to
get
at
what
i
had
but
left
me
right
side
upwards
while
i
opened
the
bundle
and
emptied
my
pockets
what
s
in
the
bottle
boy
said
he
brandy
said
i
he
was
already
handing
mincemeat
down
his
throat
in
the
most
curious
manner
more
like
a
man
who
was
putting
it
away
somewhere
in
a
violent
hurry
than
a
man
who
was
eating
it
but
he
left
off
to
take
some
of
the
liquor
he
shivered
all
the
while
so
violently
that
it
was
quite
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
keep
the
neck
of
the
bottle
between
his
teeth
without
biting
it
off
i
think
you
have
got
the
ague
said
i
i
m
much
of
your
opinion
boy
said
he
it
s
bad
about
here
i
told
him
you
ve
been
lying
out
on
the
meshes
and
they
re
dreadful
aguish
rheumatic
too
i
ll
eat
my
breakfast
afore
they
re
the
death
of
me
said
he
i
d
do
that
if
i
was
going
to
be
strung
up
to
that
there
gallows
as
there
is
over
there
directly
afterwards
i
ll
beat
the
shivers
so
far
i
ll
bet
you
he
was
gobbling
mincemeat
meatbone
bread
cheese
and
pork
pie
all
at
once
staring
distrustfully
while
he
did
so
at
the
mist
all
round
us
and
often
stopping
even
stopping
his
jaws
to
listen
some
real
or
fancied
sound
some
clink
upon
the
river
or
breathing
of
beast
upon
the
marsh
now
gave
him
a
start
and
he
said
suddenly
you
re
not
a
deceiving
imp
you
brought
no
one
with
you
no
sir
no
nor
giv
no
one
the
office
to
follow
you
no
well
said
he
i
believe
you
you
d
be
but
a
fierce
young
hound
indeed
if
at
your
time
of
life
you
could
help
to
hunt
a
wretched
warmint
hunted
as
near
death
and
dunghill
as
this
poor
wretched
warmint
is
something
clicked
in
his
throat
as
if
he
had
works
in
him
like
a
clock
and
was
going
to
strike
and
he
smeared
his
ragged
rough
sleeve
over
his
eyes
pitying
his
desolation
and
watching
him
as
he
gradually
settled
down
upon
the
pie
i
made
bold
to
say
i
am
glad
you
enjoy
it
did
you
speak
i
said
i
was
glad
you
enjoyed
it
thankee
my
boy
i
do
i
had
often
watched
a
large
dog
of
ours
eating
his
food
and
i
now
noticed
a
decided
similarity
between
the
dog
s
way
of
eating
and
the
man
s
the
man
took
strong
sharp
sudden
bites
just
like
the
dog
he
swallowed
or
rather
snapped
up
every
mouthful
too
soon
and
too
fast
and
he
looked
sideways
here
and
there
while
he
ate
as
if
he
thought
there
was
danger
in
every
direction
of
somebody
s
coming
to
take
the
pie
away
he
was
altogether
too
unsettled
in
his
mind
over
it
to
appreciate
it
comfortably
i
thought
or
to
have
anybody
to
dine
with
him
without
making
a
chop
with
his
jaws
at
the
visitor
in
all
of
which
particulars
he
was
very
like
the
dog
i
am
afraid
you
won
t
leave
any
of
it
for
him
said
i
timidly
after
a
silence
during
which
i
had
hesitated
as
to
the
politeness
of
making
the
remark
there
s
no
more
to
be
got
where
that
came
from
it
was
the
certainty
of
this
fact
that
impelled
me
to
offer
the
hint
leave
any
for
him
who
s
him
said
my
friend
stopping
in
his
crunching
of
pie
crust
the
young
man
that
you
spoke
of
that
was
hid
with
you
oh
ah
he
returned
with
something
like
a
gruff
laugh
him
yes
yes
he
don
t
want
no
wittles
i
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
did
said
i
the
man
stopped
eating
and
regarded
me
with
the
keenest
scrutiny
and
the
greatest
surprise
looked
when
just
now
where
yonder
said
i
pointing
over
there
where
i
found
him
nodding
asleep
and
thought
it
was
you
he
held
me
by
the
collar
and
stared
at
me
so
that
i
began
to
think
his
first
idea
about
cutting
my
throat
had
revived
dressed
like
you
you
know
only
with
a
hat
i
explained
trembling
and
and
i
was
very
anxious
to
put
this
delicately
and
with
the
same
reason
for
wanting
to
borrow
a
file
didn
t
you
hear
the
cannon
last
night
then
there
was
firing
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
you
shouldn
t
have
been
sure
of
that
i
returned
for
we
heard
it
up
at
home
and
that
s
farther
away
and
we
were
shut
in
besides
why
see
now
said
he
when
a
man
s
alone
on
these
flats
with
a
light
head
and
a
light
stomach
perishing
of
cold
and
want
he
hears
nothin
all
night
but
guns
firing
and
voices
calling
hears
he
sees
the
soldiers
with
their
red
coats
lighted
up
by
the
torches
carried
afore
closing
in
round
him
hears
his
number
called
hears
himself
challenged
hears
the
rattle
of
the
muskets
hears
the
orders
make
ready
present
cover
him
steady
men
and
is
laid
hands
on
and
there
s
nothin
why
if
i
see
one
pursuing
party
last
night
coming
up
in
order
damn
em
with
their
tramp
tramp
i
see
a
hundred
and
as
to
firing
why
i
see
the
mist
shake
with
the
cannon
arter
it
was
broad
day
but
this
man
he
had
said
all
the
rest
as
if
he
had
forgotten
my
being
there
did
you
notice
anything
in
him
he
had
a
badly
bruised
face
said
i
recalling
what
i
hardly
knew
i
knew
not
here
exclaimed
the
man
striking
his
left
cheek
mercilessly
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
yes
there
where
is
he
he
crammed
what
little
food
was
left
into
the
breast
of
his
gray
jacket
show
me
the
way
he
went
i
ll
pull
him
down
like
a
bloodhound
curse
this
iron
on
my
sore
leg
give
us
hold
of
the
file
boy
i
indicated
in
what
direction
the
mist
had
shrouded
the
other
man
and
he
looked
up
at
it
for
an
instant
but
he
was
down
on
the
rank
wet
grass
filing
at
his
iron
like
a
madman
and
not
minding
me
or
minding
his
own
leg
which
had
an
old
chafe
upon
it
and
was
bloody
but
which
he
handled
as
roughly
as
if
it
had
no
more
feeling
in
it
than
the
file
i
was
very
much
afraid
of
him
again
now
that
he
had
worked
himself
into
this
fierce
hurry
and
i
was
likewise
very
much
afraid
of
keeping
away
from
home
any
longer
i
told
him
i
must
go
but
he
took
no
notice
so
i
thought
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
slip
off
the
last
i
saw
of
him
his
head
was
bent
over
his
knee
and
he
was
working
hard
at
his
fetter
muttering
impatient
imprecations
at
it
and
at
his
leg
the
last
i
heard
of
him
i
stopped
in
the
mist
to
listen
and
the
file
was
still
going
chapter
iv
i
fully
expected
to
find
a
constable
in
the
kitchen
waiting
to
take
me
up
but
not
only
was
there
no
constable
there
but
no
discovery
had
yet
been
made
of
the
robbery
mrs
joe
was
prodigiously
busy
in
getting
the
house
ready
for
the
festivities
of
the
day
and
joe
had
been
put
upon
the
kitchen
doorstep
to
keep
him
out
of
the
dust
pan
an
article
into
which
his
destiny
always
led
him
sooner
or
later
when
my
sister
was
vigorously
reaping
the
floors
of
her
establishment
and
where
the
deuce
ha
you
been
was
mrs
joe
s
christmas
salutation
when
i
and
my
conscience
showed
ourselves
i
said
i
had
been
down
to
hear
the
carols
ah
well
observed
mrs
joe
you
might
ha
done
worse
not
a
doubt
of
that
i
thought
perhaps
if
i
warn
t
a
blacksmith
s
wife
and
what
s
the
same
thing
a
slave
with
her
apron
never
off
i
should
have
been
to
hear
the
carols
said
mrs
joe
i
m
rather
partial
to
carols
myself
and
that
s
the
best
of
reasons
for
my
never
hearing
any
joe
who
had
ventured
into
the
kitchen
after
me
as
the
dustpan
had
retired
before
us
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
nose
with
a
conciliatory
air
when
mrs
joe
darted
a
look
at
him
and
when
her
eyes
were
withdrawn
secretly
crossed
his
two
forefingers
and
exhibited
them
to
me
as
our
token
that
mrs
joe
was
in
a
cross
temper
this
was
so
much
her
normal
state
that
joe
and
i
would
often
for
weeks
together
be
as
to
our
fingers
like
monumental
crusaders
as
to
their
legs
we
were
to
have
a
superb
dinner
consisting
of
a
leg
of
pickled
pork
and
greens
and
a
pair
of
roast
stuffed
fowls
a
handsome
mince
pie
had
been
made
yesterday
morning
which
accounted
for
the
mincemeat
not
being
missed
and
the
pudding
was
already
on
the
boil
these
extensive
arrangements
occasioned
us
to
be
cut
off
unceremoniously
in
respect
of
breakfast
for
i
ain
t
said
mrs
joe
i
ain
t
a
going
to
have
no
formal
cramming
and
busting
and
washing
up
now
with
what
i
ve
got
before
me
i
promise
you
so
we
had
our
slices
served
out
as
if
we
were
two
thousand
troops
on
a
forced
march
instead
of
a
man
and
boy
at
home
and
we
took
gulps
of
milk
and
water
with
apologetic
countenances
from
a
jug
on
the
dresser
in
the
meantime
mrs
joe
put
clean
white
curtains
up
and
tacked
a
new
flowered
flounce
across
the
wide
chimney
to
replace
the
old
one
and
uncovered
the
little
state
parlor
across
the
passage
which
was
never
uncovered
at
any
other
time
but
passed
the
rest
of
the
year
in
a
cool
haze
of
silver
paper
which
even
extended
to
the
four
little
white
crockery
poodles
on
the
mantel
shelf
each
with
a
black
nose
and
a
basket
of
flowers
in
his
mouth
and
each
the
counterpart
of
the
other
mrs
joe
was
a
very
clean
housekeeper
but
had
an
exquisite
art
of
making
her
cleanliness
more
uncomfortable
and
unacceptable
than
dirt
itself
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
and
some
people
do
the
same
by
their
religion
my
sister
having
so
much
to
do
was
going
to
church
vicariously
that
is
to
say
joe
and
i
were
going
in
his
working
clothes
joe
was
a
well
knit
characteristic
looking
blacksmith
in
his
holiday
clothes
he
was
more
like
a
scarecrow
in
good
circumstances
than
anything
else
nothing
that
he
wore
then
fitted
him
or
seemed
to
belong
to
him
and
everything
that
he
wore
then
grazed
him
on
the
present
festive
occasion
he
emerged
from
his
room
when
the
blithe
bells
were
going
the
picture
of
misery
in
a
full
suit
of
sunday
penitentials
as
to
me
i
think
my
sister
must
have
had
some
general
idea
that
i
was
a
young
offender
whom
an
accoucheur
policeman
had
taken
up
on
my
birthday
and
delivered
over
to
her
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
the
outraged
majesty
of
the
law
i
was
always
treated
as
if
i
had
insisted
on
being
born
in
opposition
to
the
dictates
of
reason
religion
and
morality
and
against
the
dissuading
arguments
of
my
best
friends
even
when
i
was
taken
to
have
a
new
suit
of
clothes
the
tailor
had
orders
to
make
them
like
a
kind
of
reformatory
and
on
no
account
to
let
me
have
the
free
use
of
my
limbs
joe
and
i
going
to
church
therefore
must
have
been
a
moving
spectacle
for
compassionate
minds
yet
what
i
suffered
outside
was
nothing
to
what
i
underwent
within
the
terrors
that
had
assailed
me
whenever
mrs
joe
had
gone
near
the
pantry
or
out
of
the
room
were
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
remorse
with
which
my
mind
dwelt
on
what
my
hands
had
done
under
the
weight
of
my
wicked
secret
i
pondered
whether
the
church
would
be
powerful
enough
to
shield
me
from
the
vengeance
of
the
terrible
young
man
if
i
divulged
to
that
establishment
i
conceived
the
idea
that
the
time
when
the
banns
were
read
and
when
the
clergyman
said
ye
are
now
to
declare
it
would
be
the
time
for
me
to
rise
and
propose
a
private
conference
in
the
vestry
i
am
far
from
being
sure
that
i
might
not
have
astonished
our
small
congregation
by
resorting
to
this
extreme
measure
but
for
its
being
christmas
day
and
no
sunday
mr
wopsle
the
clerk
at
church
was
to
dine
with
us
and
mr
hubble
the
wheelwright
and
mrs
hubble
and
uncle
pumblechook
joe
s
uncle
but
mrs
joe
appropriated
him
who
was
a
well
to
do
cornchandler
in
the
nearest
town
and
drove
his
own
chaise
cart
the
dinner
hour
was
half
past
one
when
joe
and
i
got
home
we
found
the
table
laid
and
mrs
joe
dressed
and
the
dinner
dressing
and
the
front
door
unlocked
it
never
was
at
any
other
time
for
the
company
to
enter
by
and
everything
most
splendid
and
still
not
a
word
of
the
robbery
the
time
came
without
bringing
with
it
any
relief
to
my
feelings
and
the
company
came
mr
wopsle
united
to
a
roman
nose
and
a
large
shining
bald
forehead
had
a
deep
voice
which
he
was
uncommonly
proud
of
indeed
it
was
understood
among
his
acquaintance
that
if
you
could
only
give
him
his
head
he
would
read
the
clergyman
into
fits
he
himself
confessed
that
if
the
church
was
thrown
open
meaning
to
competition
he
would
not
despair
of
making
his
mark
in
it
the
church
not
being
thrown
open
he
was
as
i
have
said
our
clerk
but
he
punished
the
amens
tremendously
and
when
he
gave
out
the
psalm
always
giving
the
whole
verse
he
looked
all
round
the
congregation
first
as
much
as
to
say
you
have
heard
my
friend
overhead
oblige
me
with
your
opinion
of
this
style
i
opened
the
door
to
the
company
making
believe
that
it
was
a
habit
of
ours
to
open
that
door
and
i
opened
it
first
to
mr
wopsle
next
to
mr
and
mrs
hubble
and
last
of
all
to
uncle
pumblechook
n
b
i
was
not
allowed
to
call
him
uncle
under
the
severest
penalties
mrs
joe
said
uncle
pumblechook
a
large
hard
breathing
middle
aged
slow
man
with
a
mouth
like
a
fish
dull
staring
eyes
and
sandy
hair
standing
upright
on
his
head
so
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
just
been
all
but
choked
and
had
that
moment
come
to
i
have
brought
you
as
the
compliments
of
the
season
i
have
brought
you
mum
a
bottle
of
sherry
wine
and
i
have
brought
you
mum
a
bottle
of
port
wine
every
christmas
day
he
presented
himself
as
a
profound
novelty
with
exactly
the
same
words
and
carrying
the
two
bottles
like
dumb
bells
every
christmas
day
mrs
joe
replied
as
she
now
replied
o
un
cle
pum
ble
chook
this
is
kind
every
christmas
day
he
retorted
as
he
now
retorted
it
s
no
more
than
your
merits
and
now
are
you
all
bobbish
and
how
s
sixpennorth
of
halfpence
meaning
me
we
dined
on
these
occasions
in
the
kitchen
and
adjourned
for
the
nuts
and
oranges
and
apples
to
the
parlor
which
was
a
change
very
like
joe
s
change
from
his
working
clothes
to
his
sunday
dress
my
sister
was
uncommonly
lively
on
the
present
occasion
and
indeed
was
generally
more
gracious
in
the
society
of
mrs
hubble
than
in
other
company
i
remember
mrs
hubble
as
a
little
curly
sharp
edged
person
in
sky
blue
who
held
a
conventionally
juvenile
position
because
she
had
married
mr
hubble
i
don
t
know
at
what
remote
period
when
she
was
much
younger
than
he
i
remember
mr
hubble
as
a
tough
high
shouldered
stooping
old
man
of
a
sawdusty
fragrance
with
his
legs
extraordinarily
wide
apart
so
that
in
my
short
days
i
always
saw
some
miles
of
open
country
between
them
when
i
met
him
coming
up
the
lane
among
this
good
company
i
should
have
felt
myself
even
if
i
hadn
t
robbed
the
pantry
in
a
false
position
not
because
i
was
squeezed
in
at
an
acute
angle
of
the
tablecloth
with
the
table
in
my
chest
and
the
pumblechookian
elbow
in
my
eye
nor
because
i
was
not
allowed
to
speak
i
didn
t
want
to
speak
nor
because
i
was
regaled
with
the
scaly
tips
of
the
drumsticks
of
the
fowls
and
with
those
obscure
corners
of
pork
of
which
the
pig
when
living
had
had
the
least
reason
to
be
vain
no
i
should
not
have
minded
that
if
they
would
only
have
left
me
alone
but
they
wouldn
t
leave
me
alone
they
seemed
to
think
the
opportunity
lost
if
they
failed
to
point
the
conversation
at
me
every
now
and
then
and
stick
the
point
into
me
i
might
have
been
an
unfortunate
little
bull
in
a
spanish
arena
i
got
so
smartingly
touched
up
by
these
moral
goads
it
began
the
moment
we
sat
down
to
dinner
mr
wopsle
said
grace
with
theatrical
declamation
as
it
now
appears
to
me
something
like
a
religious
cross
of
the
ghost
in
hamlet
with
richard
the
third
and
ended
with
the
very
proper
aspiration
that
we
might
be
truly
grateful
upon
which
my
sister
fixed
me
with
her
eye
and
said
in
a
low
reproachful
voice
do
you
hear
that
be
grateful
especially
said
mr
pumblechook
be
grateful
boy
to
them
which
brought
you
up
by
hand
mrs
hubble
shook
her
head
and
contemplating
me
with
a
mournful
presentiment
that
i
should
come
to
no
good
asked
why
is
it
that
the
young
are
never
grateful
this
moral
mystery
seemed
too
much
for
the
company
until
mr
hubble
tersely
solved
it
by
saying
naterally
wicious
everybody
then
murmured
true
and
looked
at
me
in
a
particularly
unpleasant
and
personal
manner
joe
s
station
and
influence
were
something
feebler
if
possible
when
there
was
company
than
when
there
was
none
but
he
always
aided
and
comforted
me
when
he
could
in
some
way
of
his
own
and
he
always
did
so
at
dinner
time
by
giving
me
gravy
if
there
were
any
there
being
plenty
of
gravy
to
day
joe
spooned
into
my
plate
at
this
point
about
half
a
pint
a
little
later
on
in
the
dinner
mr
wopsle
reviewed
the
sermon
with
some
severity
and
intimated
in
the
usual
hypothetical
case
of
the
church
being
thrown
open
what
kind
of
sermon
he
would
have
given
them
after
favoring
them
with
some
heads
of
that
discourse
he
remarked
that
he
considered
the
subject
of
the
day
s
homily
ill
chosen
which
was
the
less
excusable
he
added
when
there
were
so
many
subjects
going
about
true
again
said
uncle
pumblechook
you
ve
hit
it
sir
plenty
of
subjects
going
about
for
them
that
know
how
to
put
salt
upon
their
tails
that
s
what
s
wanted
a
man
needn
t
go
far
to
find
a
subject
if
he
s
ready
with
his
salt
box
mr
pumblechook
added
after
a
short
interval
of
reflection
look
at
pork
alone
there
s
a
subject
if
you
want
a
subject
look
at
pork
true
sir
many
a
moral
for
the
young
returned
mr
wopsle
and
i
knew
he
was
going
to
lug
me
in
before
he
said
it
might
be
deduced
from
that
text
you
listen
to
this
said
my
sister
to
me
in
a
severe
parenthesis
joe
gave
me
some
more
gravy
swine
pursued
mr
wopsle
in
his
deepest
voice
and
pointing
his
fork
at
my
blushes
as
if
he
were
mentioning
my
christian
name
swine
were
the
companions
of
the
prodigal
the
gluttony
of
swine
is
put
before
us
as
an
example
to
the
young
i
thought
this
pretty
well
in
him
who
had
been
praising
up
the
pork
for
being
so
plump
and
juicy
what
is
detestable
in
a
pig
is
more
detestable
in
a
boy
or
girl
suggested
mr
hubble
of
course
or
girl
mr
hubble
assented
mr
wopsle
rather
irritably
but
there
is
no
girl
present
besides
said
mr
pumblechook
turning
sharp
on
me
think
what
you
ve
got
to
be
grateful
for
if
you
d
been
born
a
squeaker
he
was
if
ever
a
child
was
said
my
sister
most
emphatically
joe
gave
me
some
more
gravy
well
but
i
mean
a
four
footed
squeaker
said
mr
pumblechook
if
you
had
been
born
such
would
you
have
been
here
now
not
you
unless
in
that
form
said
mr
wopsle
nodding
towards
the
dish
but
i
don
t
mean
in
that
form
sir
returned
mr
pumblechook
who
had
an
objection
to
being
interrupted
i
mean
enjoying
himself
with
his
elders
and
betters
and
improving
himself
with
their
conversation
and
rolling
in
the
lap
of
luxury
would
he
have
been
doing
that
no
he
wouldn
t
and
what
would
have
been
your
destination
turning
on
me
again
you
would
have
been
disposed
of
for
so
many
shillings
according
to
the
market
price
of
the
article
and
dunstable
the
butcher
would
have
come
up
to
you
as
you
lay
in
your
straw
and
he
would
have
whipped
you
under
his
left
arm
and
with
his
right
he
would
have
tucked
up
his
frock
to
get
a
penknife
from
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
he
would
have
shed
your
blood
and
had
your
life
no
bringing
up
by
hand
then
not
a
bit
of
it
joe
offered
me
more
gravy
which
i
was
afraid
to
take
he
was
a
world
of
trouble
to
you
ma
am
said
mrs
hubble
commiserating
my
sister
trouble
echoed
my
sister
trouble
and
then
entered
on
a
fearful
catalogue
of
all
the
illnesses
i
had
been
guilty
of
and
all
the
acts
of
sleeplessness
i
had
committed
and
all
the
high
places
i
had
tumbled
from
and
all
the
low
places
i
had
tumbled
into
and
all
the
injuries
i
had
done
myself
and
all
the
times
she
had
wished
me
in
my
grave
and
i
had
contumaciously
refused
to
go
there
i
think
the
romans
must
have
aggravated
one
another
very
much
with
their
noses
perhaps
they
became
the
restless
people
they
were
in
consequence
anyhow
mr
wopsle
s
roman
nose
so
aggravated
me
during
the
recital
of
my
misdemeanours
that
i
should
have
liked
to
pull
it
until
he
howled
but
all
i
had
endured
up
to
this
time
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
awful
feelings
that
took
possession
of
me
when
the
pause
was
broken
which
ensued
upon
my
sister
s
recital
and
in
which
pause
everybody
had
looked
at
me
as
i
felt
painfully
conscious
with
indignation
and
abhorrence
yet
said
mr
pumblechook
leading
the
company
gently
back
to
the
theme
from
which
they
had
strayed
pork
regarded
as
biled
is
rich
too
ain
t
it
have
a
little
brandy
uncle
said
my
sister
o
heavens
it
had
come
at
last
he
would
find
it
was
weak
he
would
say
it
was
weak
and
i
was
lost
i
held
tight
to
the
leg
of
the
table
under
the
cloth
with
both
hands
and
awaited
my
fate
my
sister
went
for
the
stone
bottle
came
back
with
the
stone
bottle
and
poured
his
brandy
out
no
one
else
taking
any
the
wretched
man
trifled
with
his
glass
took
it
up
looked
at
it
through
the
light
put
it
down
prolonged
my
misery
all
this
time
mrs
joe
and
joe
were
briskly
clearing
the
table
for
the
pie
and
pudding
i
couldn
t
keep
my
eyes
off
him
always
holding
tight
by
the
leg
of
the
table
with
my
hands
and
feet
i
saw
the
miserable
creature
finger
his
glass
playfully
take
it
up
smile
throw
his
head
back
and
drink
the
brandy
off
instantly
afterwards
the
company
were
seized
with
unspeakable
consternation
owing
to
his
springing
to
his
feet
turning
round
several
times
in
an
appalling
spasmodic
whooping
cough
dance
and
rushing
out
at
the
door
he
then
became
visible
through
the
window
violently
plunging
and
expectorating
making
the
most
hideous
faces
and
apparently
out
of
his
mind
i
held
on
tight
while
mrs
joe
and
joe
ran
to
him
i
didn
t
know
how
i
had
done
it
but
i
had
no
doubt
i
had
murdered
him
somehow
in
my
dreadful
situation
it
was
a
relief
when
he
was
brought
back
and
surveying
the
company
all
round
as
if
they
had
disagreed
with
him
sank
down
into
his
chair
with
the
one
significant
gasp
tar
i
had
filled
up
the
bottle
from
the
tar
water
jug
i
knew
he
would
be
worse
by
and
by
i
moved
the
table
like
a
medium
of
the
present
day
by
the
vigor
of
my
unseen
hold
upon
it
tar
cried
my
sister
in
amazement
why
how
ever
could
tar
come
there
but
uncle
pumblechook
who
was
omnipotent
in
that
kitchen
wouldn
t
hear
the
word
wouldn
t
hear
of
the
subject
imperiously
waved
it
all
away
with
his
hand
and
asked
for
hot
gin
and
water
my
sister
who
had
begun
to
be
alarmingly
meditative
had
to
employ
herself
actively
in
getting
the
gin
the
hot
water
the
sugar
and
the
lemon
peel
and
mixing
them
for
the
time
being
at
least
i
was
saved
i
still
held
on
to
the
leg
of
the
table
but
clutched
it
now
with
the
fervor
of
gratitude
by
degrees
i
became
calm
enough
to
release
my
grasp
and
partake
of
pudding
mr
pumblechook
partook
of
pudding
all
partook
of
pudding
the
course
terminated
and
mr
pumblechook
had
begun
to
beam
under
the
genial
influence
of
gin
and
water
i
began
to
think
i
should
get
over
the
day
when
my
sister
said
to
joe
clean
plates
cold
i
clutched
the
leg
of
the
table
again
immediately
and
pressed
it
to
my
bosom
as
if
it
had
been
the
companion
of
my
youth
and
friend
of
my
soul
i
foresaw
what
was
coming
and
i
felt
that
this
time
i
really
was
gone
you
must
taste
said
my
sister
addressing
the
guests
with
her
best
grace
you
must
taste
to
finish
with
such
a
delightful
and
delicious
present
of
uncle
pumblechook
s
must
they
let
them
not
hope
to
taste
it
you
must
know
said
my
sister
rising
it
s
a
pie
a
savory
pork
pie
the
company
murmured
their
compliments
uncle
pumblechook
sensible
of
having
deserved
well
of
his
fellow
creatures
said
quite
vivaciously
all
things
considered
well
mrs
joe
we
ll
do
our
best
endeavors
let
us
have
a
cut
at
this
same
pie
my
sister
went
out
to
get
it
i
heard
her
steps
proceed
to
the
pantry
i
saw
mr
pumblechook
balance
his
knife
i
saw
reawakening
appetite
in
the
roman
nostrils
of
mr
wopsle
i
heard
mr
hubble
remark
that
a
bit
of
savory
pork
pie
would
lay
atop
of
anything
you
could
mention
and
do
no
harm
and
i
heard
joe
say
you
shall
have
some
pip
i
have
never
been
absolutely
certain
whether
i
uttered
a
shrill
yell
of
terror
merely
in
spirit
or
in
the
bodily
hearing
of
the
company
i
felt
that
i
could
bear
no
more
and
that
i
must
run
away
i
released
the
leg
of
the
table
and
ran
for
my
life
but
i
ran
no
farther
than
the
house
door
for
there
i
ran
head
foremost
into
a
party
of
soldiers
with
their
muskets
one
of
whom
held
out
a
pair
of
handcuffs
to
me
saying
here
you
are
look
sharp
come
on
chapter
v
the
apparition
of
a
file
of
soldiers
ringing
down
the
but
ends
of
their
loaded
muskets
on
our
door
step
caused
the
dinner
party
to
rise
from
table
in
confusion
and
caused
mrs
joe
re
entering
the
kitchen
empty
handed
to
stop
short
and
stare
in
her
wondering
lament
of
gracious
goodness
gracious
me
what
s
gone
with
the
pie
the
sergeant
and
i
were
in
the
kitchen
when
mrs
joe
stood
staring
at
which
crisis
i
partially
recovered
the
use
of
my
senses
it
was
the
sergeant
who
had
spoken
to
me
and
he
was
now
looking
round
at
the
company
with
his
handcuffs
invitingly
extended
towards
them
in
his
right
hand
and
his
left
on
my
shoulder
excuse
me
ladies
and
gentleman
said
the
sergeant
but
as
i
have
mentioned
at
the
door
to
this
smart
young
shaver
which
he
hadn
t
i
am
on
a
chase
in
the
name
of
the
king
and
i
want
the
blacksmith
and
pray
what
might
you
want
with
him
retorted
my
sister
quick
to
resent
his
being
wanted
at
all
missis
returned
the
gallant
sergeant
speaking
for
myself
i
should
reply
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
his
fine
wife
s
acquaintance
speaking
for
the
king
i
answer
a
little
job
done
this
was
received
as
rather
neat
in
the
sergeant
insomuch
that
mr
pumblechook
cried
audibly
good
again
you
see
blacksmith
said
the
sergeant
who
had
by
this
time
picked
out
joe
with
his
eye
we
have
had
an
accident
with
these
and
i
find
the
lock
of
one
of
em
goes
wrong
and
the
coupling
don
t
act
pretty
as
they
are
wanted
for
immediate
service
will
you
throw
your
eye
over
them
joe
threw
his
eye
over
them
and
pronounced
that
the
job
would
necessitate
the
lighting
of
his
forge
fire
and
would
take
nearer
two
hours
than
one
will
it
then
will
you
set
about
it
at
once
blacksmith
said
the
off
hand
sergeant
as
it
s
on
his
majesty
s
service
and
if
my
men
can
bear
a
hand
anywhere
they
ll
make
themselves
useful
with
that
he
called
to
his
men
who
came
trooping
into
the
kitchen
one
after
another
and
piled
their
arms
in
a
corner
and
then
they
stood
about
as
soldiers
do
now
with
their
hands
loosely
clasped
before
them
now
resting
a
knee
or
a
shoulder
now
easing
a
belt
or
a
pouch
now
opening
the
door
to
spit
stiffly
over
their
high
stocks
out
into
the
yard
all
these
things
i
saw
without
then
knowing
that
i
saw
them
for
i
was
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
but
beginning
to
perceive
that
the
handcuffs
were
not
for
me
and
that
the
military
had
so
far
got
the
better
of
the
pie
as
to
put
it
in
the
background
i
collected
a
little
more
of
my
scattered
wits
would
you
give
me
the
time
said
the
sergeant
addressing
himself
to
mr
pumblechook
as
to
a
man
whose
appreciative
powers
justified
the
inference
that
he
was
equal
to
the
time
it
s
just
gone
half
past
two
that
s
not
so
bad
said
the
sergeant
reflecting
even
if
i
was
forced
to
halt
here
nigh
two
hours
that
ll
do
how
far
might
you
call
yourselves
from
the
marshes
hereabouts
not
above
a
mile
i
reckon
just
a
mile
said
mrs
joe
that
ll
do
we
begin
to
close
in
upon
em
about
dusk
a
little
before
dusk
my
orders
are
that
ll
do
convicts
sergeant
asked
mr
wopsle
in
a
matter
of
course
way
ay
returned
the
sergeant
two
they
re
pretty
well
known
to
be
out
on
the
marshes
still
and
they
won
t
try
to
get
clear
of
em
before
dusk
anybody
here
seen
anything
of
any
such
game
everybody
myself
excepted
said
no
with
confidence
nobody
thought
of
me
well
said
the
sergeant
they
ll
find
themselves
trapped
in
a
circle
i
expect
sooner
than
they
count
on
now
blacksmith
if
you
re
ready
his
majesty
the
king
is
joe
had
got
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
cravat
off
and
his
leather
apron
on
and
passed
into
the
forge
one
of
the
soldiers
opened
its
wooden
windows
another
lighted
the
fire
another
turned
to
at
the
bellows
the
rest
stood
round
the
blaze
which
was
soon
roaring
then
joe
began
to
hammer
and
clink
hammer
and
clink
and
we
all
looked
on
the
interest
of
the
impending
pursuit
not
only
absorbed
the
general
attention
but
even
made
my
sister
liberal
she
drew
a
pitcher
of
beer
from
the
cask
for
the
soldiers
and
invited
the
sergeant
to
take
a
glass
of
brandy
but
mr
pumblechook
said
sharply
give
him
wine
mum
i
ll
engage
there
s
no
tar
in
that
so
the
sergeant
thanked
him
and
said
that
as
he
preferred
his
drink
without
tar
he
would
take
wine
if
it
was
equally
convenient
when
it
was
given
him
he
drank
his
majesty
s
health
and
compliments
of
the
season
and
took
it
all
at
a
mouthful
and
smacked
his
lips
good
stuff
eh
sergeant
said
mr
pumblechook
i
ll
tell
you
something
returned
the
sergeant
i
suspect
that
stuff
s
of
your
providing
mr
pumblechook
with
a
fat
sort
of
laugh
said
ay
ay
why
because
returned
the
sergeant
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
you
re
a
man
that
knows
what
s
what
d
ye
think
so
said
mr
pumblechook
with
his
former
laugh
have
another
glass
with
you
hob
and
nob
returned
the
sergeant
the
top
of
mine
to
the
foot
of
yours
the
foot
of
yours
to
the
top
of
mine
ring
once
ring
twice
the
best
tune
on
the
musical
glasses
your
health
may
you
live
a
thousand
years
and
never
be
a
worse
judge
of
the
right
sort
than
you
are
at
the
present
moment
of
your
life
the
sergeant
tossed
off
his
glass
again
and
seemed
quite
ready
for
another
glass
i
noticed
that
mr
pumblechook
in
his
hospitality
appeared
to
forget
that
he
had
made
a
present
of
the
wine
but
took
the
bottle
from
mrs
joe
and
had
all
the
credit
of
handing
it
about
in
a
gush
of
joviality
even
i
got
some
and
he
was
so
very
free
of
the
wine
that
he
even
called
for
the
other
bottle
and
handed
that
about
with
the
same
liberality
when
the
first
was
gone
as
i
watched
them
while
they
all
stood
clustering
about
the
forge
enjoying
themselves
so
much
i
thought
what
terrible
good
sauce
for
a
dinner
my
fugitive
friend
on
the
marshes
was
they
had
not
enjoyed
themselves
a
quarter
so
much
before
the
entertainment
was
brightened
with
the
excitement
he
furnished
and
now
when
they
were
all
in
lively
anticipation
of
the
two
villains
being
taken
and
when
the
bellows
seemed
to
roar
for
the
fugitives
the
fire
to
flare
for
them
the
smoke
to
hurry
away
in
pursuit
of
them
joe
to
hammer
and
clink
for
them
and
all
the
murky
shadows
on
the
wall
to
shake
at
them
in
menace
as
the
blaze
rose
and
sank
and
the
red
hot
sparks
dropped
and
died
the
pale
afternoon
outside
almost
seemed
in
my
pitying
young
fancy
to
have
turned
pale
on
their
account
poor
wretches
at
last
joe
s
job
was
done
and
the
ringing
and
roaring
stopped
as
joe
got
on
his
coat
he
mustered
courage
to
propose
that
some
of
us
should
go
down
with
the
soldiers
and
see
what
came
of
the
hunt
mr
pumblechook
and
mr
hubble
declined
on
the
plea
of
a
pipe
and
ladies
society
but
mr
wopsle
said
he
would
go
if
joe
would
joe
said
he
was
agreeable
and
would
take
me
if
mrs
joe
approved
we
never
should
have
got
leave
to
go
i
am
sure
but
for
mrs
joe
s
curiosity
to
know
all
about
it
and
how
it
ended
as
it
was
she
merely
stipulated
if
you
bring
the
boy
back
with
his
head
blown
to
bits
by
a
musket
don
t
look
to
me
to
put
it
together
again
the
sergeant
took
a
polite
leave
of
the
ladies
and
parted
from
mr
pumblechook
as
from
a
comrade
though
i
doubt
if
he
were
quite
as
fully
sensible
of
that
gentleman
s
merits
under
arid
conditions
as
when
something
moist
was
going
his
men
resumed
their
muskets
and
fell
in
mr
wopsle
joe
and
i
received
strict
charge
to
keep
in
the
rear
and
to
speak
no
word
after
we
reached
the
marshes
when
we
were
all
out
in
the
raw
air
and
were
steadily
moving
towards
our
business
i
treasonably
whispered
to
joe
i
hope
joe
we
shan
t
find
them
and
joe
whispered
to
me
i
d
give
a
shilling
if
they
had
cut
and
run
pip
we
were
joined
by
no
stragglers
from
the
village
for
the
weather
was
cold
and
threatening
the
way
dreary
the
footing
bad
darkness
coming
on
and
the
people
had
good
fires
in
doors
and
were
keeping
the
day
a
few
faces
hurried
to
glowing
windows
and
looked
after
us
but
none
came
out
we
passed
the
finger
post
and
held
straight
on
to
the
churchyard
there
we
were
stopped
a
few
minutes
by
a
signal
from
the
sergeant
s
hand
while
two
or
three
of
his
men
dispersed
themselves
among
the
graves
and
also
examined
the
porch
they
came
in
again
without
finding
anything
and
then
we
struck
out
on
the
open
marshes
through
the
gate
at
the
side
of
the
churchyard
a
bitter
sleet
came
rattling
against
us
here
on
the
east
wind
and
joe
took
me
on
his
back
now
that
we
were
out
upon
the
dismal
wilderness
where
they
little
thought
i
had
been
within
eight
or
nine
hours
and
had
seen
both
men
hiding
i
considered
for
the
first
time
with
great
dread
if
we
should
come
upon
them
would
my
particular
convict
suppose
that
it
was
i
who
had
brought
the
soldiers
there
he
had
asked
me
if
i
was
a
deceiving
imp
and
he
had
said
i
should
be
a
fierce
young
hound
if
i
joined
the
hunt
against
him
would
he
believe
that
i
was
both
imp
and
hound
in
treacherous
earnest
and
had
betrayed
him
it
was
of
no
use
asking
myself
this
question
now
there
i
was
on
joe
s
back
and
there
was
joe
beneath
me
charging
at
the
ditches
like
a
hunter
and
stimulating
mr
wopsle
not
to
tumble
on
his
roman
nose
and
to
keep
up
with
us
the
soldiers
were
in
front
of
us
extending
into
a
pretty
wide
line
with
an
interval
between
man
and
man
we
were
taking
the
course
i
had
begun
with
and
from
which
i
had
diverged
in
the
mist
either
the
mist
was
not
out
again
yet
or
the
wind
had
dispelled
it
under
the
low
red
glare
of
sunset
the
beacon
and
the
gibbet
and
the
mound
of
the
battery
and
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
were
plain
though
all
of
a
watery
lead
color
with
my
heart
thumping
like
a
blacksmith
at
joe
s
broad
shoulder
i
looked
all
about
for
any
sign
of
the
convicts
i
could
see
none
i
could
hear
none
mr
wopsle
had
greatly
alarmed
me
more
than
once
by
his
blowing
and
hard
breathing
but
i
knew
the
sounds
by
this
time
and
could
dissociate
them
from
the
object
of
pursuit
i
got
a
dreadful
start
when
i
thought
i
heard
the
file
still
going
but
it
was
only
a
sheep
bell
the
sheep
stopped
in
their
eating
and
looked
timidly
at
us
and
the
cattle
their
heads
turned
from
the
wind
and
sleet
stared
angrily
as
if
they
held
us
responsible
for
both
annoyances
but
except
these
things
and
the
shudder
of
the
dying
day
in
every
blade
of
grass
there
was
no
break
in
the
bleak
stillness
of
the
marshes
the
soldiers
were
moving
on
in
the
direction
of
the
old
battery
and
we
were
moving
on
a
little
way
behind
them
when
all
of
a
sudden
we
all
stopped
for
there
had
reached
us
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
and
rain
a
long
shout
it
was
repeated
it
was
at
a
distance
towards
the
east
but
it
was
long
and
loud
nay
there
seemed
to
be
two
or
more
shouts
raised
together
if
one
might
judge
from
a
confusion
in
the
sound
to
this
effect
the
sergeant
and
the
nearest
men
were
speaking
under
their
breath
when
joe
and
i
came
up
after
another
moment
s
listening
joe
who
was
a
good
judge
agreed
and
mr
wopsle
who
was
a
bad
judge
agreed
the
sergeant
a
decisive
man
ordered
that
the
sound
should
not
be
answered
but
that
the
course
should
be
changed
and
that
his
men
should
make
towards
it
at
the
double
so
we
slanted
to
the
right
where
the
east
was
and
joe
pounded
away
so
wonderfully
that
i
had
to
hold
on
tight
to
keep
my
seat
it
was
a
run
indeed
now
and
what
joe
called
in
the
only
two
words
he
spoke
all
the
time
a
winder
down
banks
and
up
banks
and
over
gates
and
splashing
into
dikes
and
breaking
among
coarse
rushes
no
man
cared
where
he
went
as
we
came
nearer
to
the
shouting
it
became
more
and
more
apparent
that
it
was
made
by
more
than
one
voice
sometimes
it
seemed
to
stop
altogether
and
then
the
soldiers
stopped
when
it
broke
out
again
the
soldiers
made
for
it
at
a
greater
rate
than
ever
and
we
after
them
after
a
while
we
had
so
run
it
down
that
we
could
hear
one
voice
calling
murder
and
another
voice
convicts
runaways
guard
this
way
for
the
runaway
convicts
then
both
voices
would
seem
to
be
stifled
in
a
struggle
and
then
would
break
out
again
and
when
it
had
come
to
this
the
soldiers
ran
like
deer
and
joe
too
the
sergeant
ran
in
first
when
we
had
run
the
noise
quite
down
and
two
of
his
men
ran
in
close
upon
him
their
pieces
were
cocked
and
levelled
when
we
all
ran
in
here
are
both
men
panted
the
sergeant
struggling
at
the
bottom
of
a
ditch
surrender
you
two
and
confound
you
for
two
wild
beasts
come
asunder
water
was
splashing
and
mud
was
flying
and
oaths
were
being
sworn
and
blows
were
being
struck
when
some
more
men
went
down
into
the
ditch
to
help
the
sergeant
and
dragged
out
separately
my
convict
and
the
other
one
both
were
bleeding
and
panting
and
execrating
and
struggling
but
of
course
i
knew
them
both
directly
mind
said
my
convict
wiping
blood
from
his
face
with
his
ragged
sleeves
and
shaking
torn
hair
from
his
fingers
i
took
him
i
give
him
up
to
you
mind
that
it
s
not
much
to
be
particular
about
said
the
sergeant
it
ll
do
you
small
good
my
man
being
in
the
same
plight
yourself
handcuffs
there
i
don
t
expect
it
to
do
me
any
good
i
don
t
want
it
to
do
me
more
good
than
it
does
now
said
my
convict
with
a
greedy
laugh
i
took
him
he
knows
it
that
s
enough
for
me
the
other
convict
was
livid
to
look
at
and
in
addition
to
the
old
bruised
left
side
of
his
face
seemed
to
be
bruised
and
torn
all
over
he
could
not
so
much
as
get
his
breath
to
speak
until
they
were
both
separately
handcuffed
but
leaned
upon
a
soldier
to
keep
himself
from
falling
take
notice
guard
he
tried
to
murder
me
were
his
first
words
tried
to
murder
him
said
my
convict
disdainfully
try
and
not
do
it
i
took
him
and
giv
him
up
that
s
what
i
done
i
not
only
prevented
him
getting
off
the
marshes
but
i
dragged
him
here
dragged
him
this
far
on
his
way
back
he
s
a
gentleman
if
you
please
this
villain
now
the
hulks
has
got
its
gentleman
again
through
me
murder
him
worth
my
while
too
to
murder
him
when
i
could
do
worse
and
drag
him
back
the
other
one
still
gasped
he
tried
he
tried
to
murder
me
bear
bear
witness
lookee
here
said
my
convict
to
the
sergeant
single
handed
i
got
clear
of
the
prison
ship
i
made
a
dash
and
i
done
it
i
could
ha
got
clear
of
these
death
cold
flats
likewise
look
at
my
leg
you
won
t
find
much
iron
on
it
if
i
hadn
t
made
the
discovery
that
he
was
here
let
him
go
free
let
him
profit
by
the
means
as
i
found
out
let
him
make
a
tool
of
me
afresh
and
again
once
more
no
no
no
if
i
had
died
at
the
bottom
there
and
he
made
an
emphatic
swing
at
the
ditch
with
his
manacled
hands
i
d
have
held
to
him
with
that
grip
that
you
should
have
been
safe
to
find
him
in
my
hold
the
other
fugitive
who
was
evidently
in
extreme
horror
of
his
companion
repeated
he
tried
to
murder
me
i
should
have
been
a
dead
man
if
you
had
not
come
up
he
lies
said
my
convict
with
fierce
energy
he
s
a
liar
born
and
he
ll
die
a
liar
look
at
his
face
ain
t
it
written
there
let
him
turn
those
eyes
of
his
on
me
i
defy
him
to
do
it
the
other
with
an
effort
at
a
scornful
smile
which
could
not
however
collect
the
nervous
working
of
his
mouth
into
any
set
expression
looked
at
the
soldiers
and
looked
about
at
the
marshes
and
at
the
sky
but
certainly
did
not
look
at
the
speaker
do
you
see
him
pursued
my
convict
do
you
see
what
a
villain
he
is
do
you
see
those
grovelling
and
wandering
eyes
that
s
how
he
looked
when
we
were
tried
together
he
never
looked
at
me
the
other
always
working
and
working
his
dry
lips
and
turning
his
eyes
restlessly
about
him
far
and
near
did
at
last
turn
them
for
a
moment
on
the
speaker
with
the
words
you
are
not
much
to
look
at
and
with
a
half
taunting
glance
at
the
bound
hands
at
that
point
my
convict
became
so
frantically
exasperated
that
he
would
have
rushed
upon
him
but
for
the
interposition
of
the
soldiers
didn
t
i
tell
you
said
the
other
convict
then
that
he
would
murder
me
if
he
could
and
any
one
could
see
that
he
shook
with
fear
and
that
there
broke
out
upon
his
lips
curious
white
flakes
like
thin
snow
enough
of
this
parley
said
the
sergeant
light
those
torches
as
one
of
the
soldiers
who
carried
a
basket
in
lieu
of
a
gun
went
down
on
his
knee
to
open
it
my
convict
looked
round
him
for
the
first
time
and
saw
me
i
had
alighted
from
joe
s
back
on
the
brink
of
the
ditch
when
we
came
up
and
had
not
moved
since
i
looked
at
him
eagerly
when
he
looked
at
me
and
slightly
moved
my
hands
and
shook
my
head
i
had
been
waiting
for
him
to
see
me
that
i
might
try
to
assure
him
of
my
innocence
it
was
not
at
all
expressed
to
me
that
he
even
comprehended
my
intention
for
he
gave
me
a
look
that
i
did
not
understand
and
it
all
passed
in
a
moment
but
if
he
had
looked
at
me
for
an
hour
or
for
a
day
i
could
not
have
remembered
his
face
ever
afterwards
as
having
been
more
attentive
the
soldier
with
the
basket
soon
got
a
light
and
lighted
three
or
four
torches
and
took
one
himself
and
distributed
the
others
it
had
been
almost
dark
before
but
now
it
seemed
quite
dark
and
soon
afterwards
very
dark
before
we
departed
from
that
spot
four
soldiers
standing
in
a
ring
fired
twice
into
the
air
presently
we
saw
other
torches
kindled
at
some
distance
behind
us
and
others
on
the
marshes
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
all
right
said
the
sergeant
march
we
had
not
gone
far
when
three
cannon
were
fired
ahead
of
us
with
a
sound
that
seemed
to
burst
something
inside
my
ear
you
are
expected
on
board
said
the
sergeant
to
my
convict
they
know
you
are
coming
don
t
straggle
my
man
close
up
here
the
two
were
kept
apart
and
each
walked
surrounded
by
a
separate
guard
i
had
hold
of
joe
s
hand
now
and
joe
carried
one
of
the
torches
mr
wopsle
had
been
for
going
back
but
joe
was
resolved
to
see
it
out
so
we
went
on
with
the
party
there
was
a
reasonably
good
path
now
mostly
on
the
edge
of
the
river
with
a
divergence
here
and
there
where
a
dike
came
with
a
miniature
windmill
on
it
and
a
muddy
sluice
gate
when
i
looked
round
i
could
see
the
other
lights
coming
in
after
us
the
torches
we
carried
dropped
great
blotches
of
fire
upon
the
track
and
i
could
see
those
too
lying
smoking
and
flaring
i
could
see
nothing
else
but
black
darkness
our
lights
warmed
the
air
about
us
with
their
pitchy
blaze
and
the
two
prisoners
seemed
rather
to
like
that
as
they
limped
along
in
the
midst
of
the
muskets
we
could
not
go
fast
because
of
their
lameness
and
they
were
so
spent
that
two
or
three
times
we
had
to
halt
while
they
rested
after
an
hour
or
so
of
this
travelling
we
came
to
a
rough
wooden
hut
and
a
landing
place
there
was
a
guard
in
the
hut
and
they
challenged
and
the
sergeant
answered
then
we
went
into
the
hut
where
there
was
a
smell
of
tobacco
and
whitewash
and
a
bright
fire
and
a
lamp
and
a
stand
of
muskets
and
a
drum
and
a
low
wooden
bedstead
like
an
overgrown
mangle
without
the
machinery
capable
of
holding
about
a
dozen
soldiers
all
at
once
three
or
four
soldiers
who
lay
upon
it
in
their
great
coats
were
not
much
interested
in
us
but
just
lifted
their
heads
and
took
a
sleepy
stare
and
then
lay
down
again
the
sergeant
made
some
kind
of
report
and
some
entry
in
a
book
and
then
the
convict
whom
i
call
the
other
convict
was
drafted
off
with
his
guard
to
go
on
board
first
my
convict
never
looked
at
me
except
that
once
while
we
stood
in
the
hut
he
stood
before
the
fire
looking
thoughtfully
at
it
or
putting
up
his
feet
by
turns
upon
the
hob
and
looking
thoughtfully
at
them
as
if
he
pitied
them
for
their
recent
adventures
suddenly
he
turned
to
the
sergeant
and
remarked
i
wish
to
say
something
respecting
this
escape
it
may
prevent
some
persons
laying
under
suspicion
alonger
me
you
can
say
what
you
like
returned
the
sergeant
standing
coolly
looking
at
him
with
his
arms
folded
but
you
have
no
call
to
say
it
here
you
ll
have
opportunity
enough
to
say
about
it
and
hear
about
it
before
it
s
done
with
you
know
i
know
but
this
is
another
pint
a
separate
matter
a
man
can
t
starve
at
least
i
can
t
i
took
some
wittles
up
at
the
willage
over
yonder
where
the
church
stands
a
most
out
on
the
marshes
you
mean
stole
said
the
sergeant
and
i
ll
tell
you
where
from
from
the
blacksmith
s
halloa
said
the
sergeant
staring
at
joe
halloa
pip
said
joe
staring
at
me
it
was
some
broken
wittles
that
s
what
it
was
and
a
dram
of
liquor
and
a
pie
have
you
happened
to
miss
such
an
article
as
a
pie
blacksmith
asked
the
sergeant
confidentially
my
wife
did
at
the
very
moment
when
you
came
in
don
t
you
know
pip
so
said
my
convict
turning
his
eyes
on
joe
in
a
moody
manner
and
without
the
least
glance
at
me
so
you
re
the
blacksmith
are
you
than
i
m
sorry
to
say
i
ve
eat
your
pie
god
knows
you
re
welcome
to
it
so
far
as
it
was
ever
mine
returned
joe
with
a
saving
remembrance
of
mrs
joe
we
don
t
know
what
you
have
done
but
we
wouldn
t
have
you
starved
to
death
for
it
poor
miserable
fellow
creatur
would
us
pip
the
something
that
i
had
noticed
before
clicked
in
the
man
s
throat
again
and
he
turned
his
back
the
boat
had
returned
and
his
guard
were
ready
so
we
followed
him
to
the
landing
place
made
of
rough
stakes
and
stones
and
saw
him
put
into
the
boat
which
was
rowed
by
a
crew
of
convicts
like
himself
no
one
seemed
surprised
to
see
him
or
interested
in
seeing
him
or
glad
to
see
him
or
sorry
to
see
him
or
spoke
a
word
except
that
somebody
in
the
boat
growled
as
if
to
dogs
give
way
you
which
was
the
signal
for
the
dip
of
the
oars
by
the
light
of
the
torches
we
saw
the
black
hulk
lying
out
a
little
way
from
the
mud
of
the
shore
like
a
wicked
noah
s
ark
cribbed
and
barred
and
moored
by
massive
rusty
chains
the
prison
ship
seemed
in
my
young
eyes
to
be
ironed
like
the
prisoners
we
saw
the
boat
go
alongside
and
we
saw
him
taken
up
the
side
and
disappear
then
the
ends
of
the
torches
were
flung
hissing
into
the
water
and
went
out
as
if
it
were
all
over
with
him
chapter
vi
my
state
of
mind
regarding
the
pilfering
from
which
i
had
been
so
unexpectedly
exonerated
did
not
impel
me
to
frank
disclosure
but
i
hope
it
had
some
dregs
of
good
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
do
not
recall
that
i
felt
any
tenderness
of
conscience
in
reference
to
mrs
joe
when
the
fear
of
being
found
out
was
lifted
off
me
but
i
loved
joe
perhaps
for
no
better
reason
in
those
early
days
than
because
the
dear
fellow
let
me
love
him
and
as
to
him
my
inner
self
was
not
so
easily
composed
it
was
much
upon
my
mind
particularly
when
i
first
saw
him
looking
about
for
his
file
that
i
ought
to
tell
joe
the
whole
truth
yet
i
did
not
and
for
the
reason
that
i
mistrusted
that
if
i
did
he
would
think
me
worse
than
i
was
the
fear
of
losing
joe
s
confidence
and
of
thenceforth
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
at
night
staring
drearily
at
my
forever
lost
companion
and
friend
tied
up
my
tongue
i
morbidly
represented
to
myself
that
if
joe
knew
it
i
never
afterwards
could
see
him
at
the
fireside
feeling
his
fair
whisker
without
thinking
that
he
was
meditating
on
it
that
if
joe
knew
it
i
never
afterwards
could
see
him
glance
however
casually
at
yesterday
s
meat
or
pudding
when
it
came
on
to
day
s
table
without
thinking
that
he
was
debating
whether
i
had
been
in
the
pantry
that
if
joe
knew
it
and
at
any
subsequent
period
of
our
joint
domestic
life
remarked
that
his
beer
was
flat
or
thick
the
conviction
that
he
suspected
tar
in
it
would
bring
a
rush
of
blood
to
my
face
in
a
word
i
was
too
cowardly
to
do
what
i
knew
to
be
right
as
i
had
been
too
cowardly
to
avoid
doing
what
i
knew
to
be
wrong
i
had
had
no
intercourse
with
the
world
at
that
time
and
i
imitated
none
of
its
many
inhabitants
who
act
in
this
manner
quite
an
untaught
genius
i
made
the
discovery
of
the
line
of
action
for
myself
as
i
was
sleepy
before
we
were
far
away
from
the
prison
ship
joe
took
me
on
his
back
again
and
carried
me
home
he
must
have
had
a
tiresome
journey
of
it
for
mr
wopsle
being
knocked
up
was
in
such
a
very
bad
temper
that
if
the
church
had
been
thrown
open
he
would
probably
have
excommunicated
the
whole
expedition
beginning
with
joe
and
myself
in
his
lay
capacity
he
persisted
in
sitting
down
in
the
damp
to
such
an
insane
extent
that
when
his
coat
was
taken
off
to
be
dried
at
the
kitchen
fire
the
circumstantial
evidence
on
his
trousers
would
have
hanged
him
if
it
had
been
a
capital
offence
by
that
time
i
was
staggering
on
the
kitchen
floor
like
a
little
drunkard
through
having
been
newly
set
upon
my
feet
and
through
having
been
fast
asleep
and
through
waking
in
the
heat
and
lights
and
noise
of
tongues
as
i
came
to
myself
with
the
aid
of
a
heavy
thump
between
the
shoulders
and
the
restorative
exclamation
yah
was
there
ever
such
a
boy
as
this
from
my
sister
i
found
joe
telling
them
about
the
convict
s
confession
and
all
the
visitors
suggesting
different
ways
by
which
he
had
got
into
the
pantry
mr
pumblechook
made
out
after
carefully
surveying
the
premises
that
he
had
first
got
upon
the
roof
of
the
forge
and
had
then
got
upon
the
roof
of
the
house
and
had
then
let
himself
down
the
kitchen
chimney
by
a
rope
made
of
his
bedding
cut
into
strips
and
as
mr
pumblechook
was
very
positive
and
drove
his
own
chaise
cart
over
everybody
it
was
agreed
that
it
must
be
so
mr
wopsle
indeed
wildly
cried
out
no
with
the
feeble
malice
of
a
tired
man
but
as
he
had
no
theory
and
no
coat
on
he
was
unanimously
set
at
naught
not
to
mention
his
smoking
hard
behind
as
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
kitchen
fire
to
draw
the
damp
out
which
was
not
calculated
to
inspire
confidence
this
was
all
i
heard
that
night
before
my
sister
clutched
me
as
a
slumberous
offence
to
the
company
s
eyesight
and
assisted
me
up
to
bed
with
such
a
strong
hand
that
i
seemed
to
have
fifty
boots
on
and
to
be
dangling
them
all
against
the
edges
of
the
stairs
my
state
of
mind
as
i
have
described
it
began
before
i
was
up
in
the
morning
and
lasted
long
after
the
subject
had
died
out
and
had
ceased
to
be
mentioned
saving
on
exceptional
occasions
chapter
vii
at
the
time
when
i
stood
in
the
churchyard
reading
the
family
tombstones
i
had
just
enough
learning
to
be
able
to
spell
them
out
my
construction
even
of
their
simple
meaning
was
not
very
correct
for
i
read
wife
of
the
above
as
a
complimentary
reference
to
my
father
s
exaltation
to
a
better
world
and
if
any
one
of
my
deceased
relations
had
been
referred
to
as
below
i
have
no
doubt
i
should
have
formed
the
worst
opinions
of
that
member
of
the
family
neither
were
my
notions
of
the
theological
positions
to
which
my
catechism
bound
me
at
all
accurate
for
i
have
a
lively
remembrance
that
i
supposed
my
declaration
that
i
was
to
walk
in
the
same
all
the
days
of
my
life
laid
me
under
an
obligation
always
to
go
through
the
village
from
our
house
in
one
particular
direction
and
never
to
vary
it
by
turning
down
by
the
wheelwright
s
or
up
by
the
mill
when
i
was
old
enough
i
was
to
be
apprenticed
to
joe
and
until
i
could
assume
that
dignity
i
was
not
to
be
what
mrs
joe
called
pompeyed
or
as
i
render
it
pampered
therefore
i
was
not
only
odd
boy
about
the
forge
but
if
any
neighbor
happened
to
want
an
extra
boy
to
frighten
birds
or
pick
up
stones
or
do
any
such
job
i
was
favored
with
the
employment
in
order
however
that
our
superior
position
might
not
be
compromised
thereby
a
money
box
was
kept
on
the
kitchen
mantel
shelf
in
to
which
it
was
publicly
made
known
that
all
my
earnings
were
dropped
i
have
an
impression
that
they
were
to
be
contributed
eventually
towards
the
liquidation
of
the
national
debt
but
i
know
i
had
no
hope
of
any
personal
participation
in
the
treasure
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
kept
an
evening
school
in
the
village
that
is
to
say
she
was
a
ridiculous
old
woman
of
limited
means
and
unlimited
infirmity
who
used
to
go
to
sleep
from
six
to
seven
every
evening
in
the
society
of
youth
who
paid
two
pence
per
week
each
for
the
improving
opportunity
of
seeing
her
do
it
she
rented
a
small
cottage
and
mr
wopsle
had
the
room
up
stairs
where
we
students
used
to
overhear
him
reading
aloud
in
a
most
dignified
and
terrific
manner
and
occasionally
bumping
on
the
ceiling
there
was
a
fiction
that
mr
wopsle
examined
the
scholars
once
a
quarter
what
he
did
on
those
occasions
was
to
turn
up
his
cuffs
stick
up
his
hair
and
give
us
mark
antony
s
oration
over
the
body
of
caesar
this
was
always
followed
by
collins
s
ode
on
the
passions
wherein
i
particularly
venerated
mr
wopsle
as
revenge
throwing
his
blood
stained
sword
in
thunder
down
and
taking
the
war
denouncing
trumpet
with
a
withering
look
it
was
not
with
me
then
as
it
was
in
later
life
when
i
fell
into
the
society
of
the
passions
and
compared
them
with
collins
and
wopsle
rather
to
the
disadvantage
of
both
gentlemen
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
besides
keeping
this
educational
institution
kept
in
the
same
room
a
little
general
shop
she
had
no
idea
what
stock
she
had
or
what
the
price
of
anything
in
it
was
but
there
was
a
little
greasy
memorandum
book
kept
in
a
drawer
which
served
as
a
catalogue
of
prices
and
by
this
oracle
biddy
arranged
all
the
shop
transaction
biddy
was
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
s
granddaughter
i
confess
myself
quiet
unequal
to
the
working
out
of
the
problem
what
relation
she
was
to
mr
wopsle
she
was
an
orphan
like
myself
like
me
too
had
been
brought
up
by
hand
she
was
most
noticeable
i
thought
in
respect
of
her
extremities
for
her
hair
always
wanted
brushing
her
hands
always
wanted
washing
and
her
shoes
always
wanted
mending
and
pulling
up
at
heel
this
description
must
be
received
with
a
week
day
limitation
on
sundays
she
went
to
church
elaborated
much
of
my
unassisted
self
and
more
by
the
help
of
biddy
than
of
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
i
struggled
through
the
alphabet
as
if
it
had
been
a
bramble
bush
getting
considerably
worried
and
scratched
by
every
letter
after
that
i
fell
among
those
thieves
the
nine
figures
who
seemed
every
evening
to
do
something
new
to
disguise
themselves
and
baffle
recognition
but
at
last
i
began
in
a
purblind
groping
way
to
read
write
and
cipher
on
the
very
smallest
scale
one
night
i
was
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
with
my
slate
expending
great
efforts
on
the
production
of
a
letter
to
joe
i
think
it
must
have
been
a
full
year
after
our
hunt
upon
the
marshes
for
it
was
a
long
time
after
and
it
was
winter
and
a
hard
frost
with
an
alphabet
on
the
hearth
at
my
feet
for
reference
i
contrived
in
an
hour
or
two
to
print
and
smear
this
epistle

there
was
no
indispensable
necessity
for
my
communicating
with
joe
by
letter
inasmuch
as
he
sat
beside
me
and
we
were
alone
but
i
delivered
this
written
communication
slate
and
all
with
my
own
hand
and
joe
received
it
as
a
miracle
of
erudition
i
say
pip
old
chap
cried
joe
opening
his
blue
eyes
wide
what
a
scholar
you
are
an
t
you
i
should
like
to
be
said
i
glancing
at
the
slate
as
he
held
it
with
a
misgiving
that
the
writing
was
rather
hilly
why
here
s
a
j
said
joe
and
a
o
equal
to
anythink
here
s
a
j
and
a
o
pip
and
a
j
o
joe
i
had
never
heard
joe
read
aloud
to
any
greater
extent
than
this
monosyllable
and
i
had
observed
at
church
last
sunday
when
i
accidentally
held
our
prayer
book
upside
down
that
it
seemed
to
suit
his
convenience
quite
as
well
as
if
it
had
been
all
right
wishing
to
embrace
the
present
occasion
of
finding
out
whether
in
teaching
joe
i
should
have
to
begin
quite
at
the
beginning
i
said
ah
but
read
the
rest
jo
the
rest
eh
pip
said
joe
looking
at
it
with
a
slow
searching
eye
one
two
three
why
here
s
three
js
and
three
os
and
three
j
o
joes
in
it
pip
i
leaned
over
joe
and
with
the
aid
of
my
forefinger
read
him
the
whole
letter
astonishing
said
joe
when
i
had
finished
you
are
a
scholar
how
do
you
spell
gargery
joe
i
asked
him
with
a
modest
patronage
i
don
t
spell
it
at
all
said
joe
but
supposing
you
did
it
can
t
be
supposed
said
joe
tho
i
m
uncommon
fond
of
reading
too
are
you
joe
on
common
give
me
said
joe
a
good
book
or
a
good
newspaper
and
sit
me
down
afore
a
good
fire
and
i
ask
no
better
lord
he
continued
after
rubbing
his
knees
a
little
when
you
do
come
to
a
j
and
a
o
and
says
you
here
at
last
is
a
j
o
joe
how
interesting
reading
is
i
derived
from
this
that
joe
s
education
like
steam
was
yet
in
its
infancy
pursuing
the
subject
i
inquired
didn
t
you
ever
go
to
school
joe
when
you
were
as
little
as
me
no
pip
why
didn
t
you
ever
go
to
school
joe
when
you
were
as
little
as
me
well
pip
said
joe
taking
up
the
poker
and
settling
himself
to
his
usual
occupation
when
he
was
thoughtful
of
slowly
raking
the
fire
between
the
lower
bars
i
ll
tell
you
my
father
pip
he
were
given
to
drink
and
when
he
were
overtook
with
drink
he
hammered
away
at
my
mother
most
onmerciful
it
were
a
most
the
only
hammering
he
did
indeed
xcepting
at
myself
and
he
hammered
at
me
with
a
wigor
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
wigor
with
which
he
didn
t
hammer
at
his
anwil
you
re
a
listening
and
understanding
pip
yes
joe
consequence
my
mother
and
me
we
ran
away
from
my
father
several
times
and
then
my
mother
she
d
go
out
to
work
and
she
d
say
joe
she
d
say
now
please
god
you
shall
have
some
schooling
child
and
she
d
put
me
to
school
but
my
father
were
that
good
in
his
hart
that
he
couldn
t
abear
to
be
without
us
so
he
d
come
with
a
most
tremenjous
crowd
and
make
such
a
row
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
where
we
was
that
they
used
to
be
obligated
to
have
no
more
to
do
with
us
and
to
give
us
up
to
him
and
then
he
took
us
home
and
hammered
us
which
you
see
pip
said
joe
pausing
in
his
meditative
raking
of
the
fire
and
looking
at
me
were
a
drawback
on
my
learning
certainly
poor
joe
though
mind
you
pip
said
joe
with
a
judicial
touch
or
two
of
the
poker
on
the
top
bar
rendering
unto
all
their
doo
and
maintaining
equal
justice
betwixt
man
and
man
my
father
were
that
good
in
his
hart
don
t
you
see
i
didn
t
see
but
i
didn
t
say
so
well
joe
pursued
somebody
must
keep
the
pot
a
biling
pip
or
the
pot
won
t
bile
don
t
you
know
i
saw
that
and
said
so
consequence
my
father
didn
t
make
objections
to
my
going
to
work
so
i
went
to
work
at
my
present
calling
which
were
his
too
if
he
would
have
followed
it
and
i
worked
tolerable
hard
i
assure
you
pip
in
time
i
were
able
to
keep
him
and
i
kep
him
till
he
went
off
in
a
purple
leptic
fit
and
it
were
my
intentions
to
have
had
put
upon
his
tombstone
that
whatsume
er
the
failings
on
his
part
remember
reader
he
were
that
good
in
his
heart
joe
recited
this
couplet
with
such
manifest
pride
and
careful
perspicuity
that
i
asked
him
if
he
had
made
it
himself
i
made
it
said
joe
my
own
self
i
made
it
in
a
moment
it
was
like
striking
out
a
horseshoe
complete
in
a
single
blow
i
never
was
so
much
surprised
in
all
my
life
couldn
t
credit
my
own
ed
to
tell
you
the
truth
hardly
believed
it
were
my
own
ed
as
i
was
saying
pip
it
were
my
intentions
to
have
had
it
cut
over
him
but
poetry
costs
money
cut
it
how
you
will
small
or
large
and
it
were
not
done
not
to
mention
bearers
all
the
money
that
could
be
spared
were
wanted
for
my
mother
she
were
in
poor
elth
and
quite
broke
she
weren
t
long
of
following
poor
soul
and
her
share
of
peace
come
round
at
last
joe
s
blue
eyes
turned
a
little
watery
he
rubbed
first
one
of
them
and
then
the
other
in
a
most
uncongenial
and
uncomfortable
manner
with
the
round
knob
on
the
top
of
the
poker
it
were
but
lonesome
then
said
joe
living
here
alone
and
i
got
acquainted
with
your
sister
now
pip
joe
looked
firmly
at
me
as
if
he
knew
i
was
not
going
to
agree
with
him
your
sister
is
a
fine
figure
of
a
woman
i
could
not
help
looking
at
the
fire
in
an
obvious
state
of
doubt
whatever
family
opinions
or
whatever
the
world
s
opinions
on
that
subject
may
be
pip
your
sister
is
joe
tapped
the
top
bar
with
the
poker
after
every
word
following
a
fine
figure
of
a
woman
i
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
than
i
am
glad
you
think
so
joe
so
am
i
returned
joe
catching
me
up
i
am
glad
i
think
so
pip
a
little
redness
or
a
little
matter
of
bone
here
or
there
what
does
it
signify
to
me
i
sagaciously
observed
if
it
didn
t
signify
to
him
to
whom
did
it
signify
certainly
assented
joe
that
s
it
you
re
right
old
chap
when
i
got
acquainted
with
your
sister
it
were
the
talk
how
she
was
bringing
you
up
by
hand
very
kind
of
her
too
all
the
folks
said
and
i
said
along
with
all
the
folks
as
to
you
joe
pursued
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
seeing
something
very
nasty
indeed
if
you
could
have
been
aware
how
small
and
flabby
and
mean
you
was
dear
me
you
d
have
formed
the
most
contemptible
opinion
of
yourself
not
exactly
relishing
this
i
said
never
mind
me
joe
but
i
did
mind
you
pip
he
returned
with
tender
simplicity
when
i
offered
to
your
sister
to
keep
company
and
to
be
asked
in
church
at
such
times
as
she
was
willing
and
ready
to
come
to
the
forge
i
said
to
her
and
bring
the
poor
little
child
god
bless
the
poor
little
child
i
said
to
your
sister
there
s
room
for
him
at
the
forge
i
broke
out
crying
and
begging
pardon
and
hugged
joe
round
the
neck
who
dropped
the
poker
to
hug
me
and
to
say
ever
the
best
of
friends
an
t
us
pip
don
t
cry
old
chap
when
this
little
interruption
was
over
joe
resumed
well
you
see
pip
and
here
we
are
that
s
about
where
it
lights
here
we
are
now
when
you
take
me
in
hand
in
my
learning
pip
and
i
tell
you
beforehand
i
am
awful
dull
most
awful
dull
mrs
joe
mustn
t
see
too
much
of
what
we
re
up
to
it
must
be
done
as
i
may
say
on
the
sly
and
why
on
the
sly
i
ll
tell
you
why
pip
he
had
taken
up
the
poker
again
without
which
i
doubt
if
he
could
have
proceeded
in
his
demonstration
your
sister
is
given
to
government
given
to
government
joe
i
was
startled
for
i
had
some
shadowy
idea
and
i
am
afraid
i
must
add
hope
that
joe
had
divorced
her
in
a
favor
of
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
or
treasury
given
to
government
said
joe
which
i
meantersay
the
government
of
you
and
myself
oh
and
she
an
t
over
partial
to
having
scholars
on
the
premises
joe
continued
and
in
partickler
would
not
be
over
partial
to
my
being
a
scholar
for
fear
as
i
might
rise
like
a
sort
of
rebel
don
t
you
see
i
was
going
to
retort
with
an
inquiry
and
had
got
as
far
as
why
when
joe
stopped
me
stay
a
bit
i
know
what
you
re
a
going
to
say
pip
stay
a
bit
i
don
t
deny
that
your
sister
comes
the
mo
gul
over
us
now
and
again
i
don
t
deny
that
she
do
throw
us
back
falls
and
that
she
do
drop
down
upon
us
heavy
at
such
times
as
when
your
sister
is
on
the
ram
page
pip
joe
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
glanced
at
the
door
candor
compels
fur
to
admit
that
she
is
a
buster
joe
pronounced
this
word
as
if
it
began
with
at
least
twelve
capital
bs
why
don
t
i
rise
that
were
your
observation
when
i
broke
it
off
pip
yes
joe
well
said
joe
passing
the
poker
into
his
left
hand
that
he
might
feel
his
whisker
and
i
had
no
hope
of
him
whenever
he
took
to
that
placid
occupation
your
sister
s
a
master
mind
a
master
mind
what
s
that
i
asked
in
some
hope
of
bringing
him
to
a
stand
but
joe
was
readier
with
his
definition
than
i
had
expected
and
completely
stopped
me
by
arguing
circularly
and
answering
with
a
fixed
look
her
and
i
ain
t
a
master
mind
joe
resumed
when
he
had
unfixed
his
look
and
got
back
to
his
whisker
and
last
of
all
pip
and
this
i
want
to
say
very
serious
to
you
old
chap
i
see
so
much
in
my
poor
mother
of
a
woman
drudging
and
slaving
and
breaking
her
honest
hart
and
never
getting
no
peace
in
her
mortal
days
that
i
m
dead
afeerd
of
going
wrong
in
the
way
of
not
doing
what
s
right
by
a
woman
and
i
d
fur
rather
of
the
two
go
wrong
the
t
other
way
and
be
a
little
ill
conwenienced
myself
i
wish
it
was
only
me
that
got
put
out
pip
i
wish
there
warn
t
no
tickler
for
you
old
chap
i
wish
i
could
take
it
all
on
myself
but
this
is
the
up
and
down
and
straight
on
it
pip
and
i
hope
you
ll
overlook
shortcomings
young
as
i
was
i
believe
that
i
dated
a
new
admiration
of
joe
from
that
night
we
were
equals
afterwards
as
we
had
been
before
but
afterwards
at
quiet
times
when
i
sat
looking
at
joe
and
thinking
about
him
i
had
a
new
sensation
of
feeling
conscious
that
i
was
looking
up
to
joe
in
my
heart
however
said
joe
rising
to
replenish
the
fire
here
s
the
dutch
clock
a
working
himself
up
to
being
equal
to
strike
eight
of
em
and
she
s
not
come
home
yet
i
hope
uncle
pumblechook
s
mare
mayn
t
have
set
a
forefoot
on
a
piece
o
ice
and
gone
down
mrs
joe
made
occasional
trips
with
uncle
pumblechook
on
market
days
to
assist
him
in
buying
such
household
stuffs
and
goods
as
required
a
woman
s
judgment
uncle
pumblechook
being
a
bachelor
and
reposing
no
confidences
in
his
domestic
servant
this
was
market
day
and
mrs
joe
was
out
on
one
of
these
expeditions
joe
made
the
fire
and
swept
the
hearth
and
then
we
went
to
the
door
to
listen
for
the
chaise
cart
it
was
a
dry
cold
night
and
the
wind
blew
keenly
and
the
frost
was
white
and
hard
a
man
would
die
to
night
of
lying
out
on
the
marshes
i
thought
and
then
i
looked
at
the
stars
and
considered
how
awful
it
would
be
for
a
man
to
turn
his
face
up
to
them
as
he
froze
to
death
and
see
no
help
or
pity
in
all
the
glittering
multitude
here
comes
the
mare
said
joe
ringing
like
a
peal
of
bells
the
sound
of
her
iron
shoes
upon
the
hard
road
was
quite
musical
as
she
came
along
at
a
much
brisker
trot
than
usual
we
got
a
chair
out
ready
for
mrs
joe
s
alighting
and
stirred
up
the
fire
that
they
might
see
a
bright
window
and
took
a
final
survey
of
the
kitchen
that
nothing
might
be
out
of
its
place
when
we
had
completed
these
preparations
they
drove
up
wrapped
to
the
eyes
mrs
joe
was
soon
landed
and
uncle
pumblechook
was
soon
down
too
covering
the
mare
with
a
cloth
and
we
were
soon
all
in
the
kitchen
carrying
so
much
cold
air
in
with
us
that
it
seemed
to
drive
all
the
heat
out
of
the
fire
now
said
mrs
joe
unwrapping
herself
with
haste
and
excitement
and
throwing
her
bonnet
back
on
her
shoulders
where
it
hung
by
the
strings
if
this
boy
ain
t
grateful
this
night
he
never
will
be
i
looked
as
grateful
as
any
boy
possibly
could
who
was
wholly
uninformed
why
he
ought
to
assume
that
expression
it
s
only
to
be
hoped
said
my
sister
that
he
won
t
be
pompeyed
but
i
have
my
fears
she
ain
t
in
that
line
mum
said
mr
pumblechook
she
knows
better
she
i
looked
at
joe
making
the
motion
with
my
lips
and
eyebrows
she
joe
looked
at
me
making
the
motion
with
his
lips
and
eyebrows
she
my
sister
catching
him
in
the
act
he
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
nose
with
his
usual
conciliatory
air
on
such
occasions
and
looked
at
her
well
said
my
sister
in
her
snappish
way
what
are
you
staring
at
is
the
house
afire
which
some
individual
joe
politely
hinted
mentioned
she
and
she
is
a
she
i
suppose
said
my
sister
unless
you
call
miss
havisham
a
he
and
i
doubt
if
even
you
ll
go
so
far
as
that
miss
havisham
up
town
said
joe
is
there
any
miss
havisham
down
town
returned
my
sister
she
wants
this
boy
to
go
and
play
there
and
of
course
he
s
going
and
he
had
better
play
there
said
my
sister
shaking
her
head
at
me
as
an
encouragement
to
be
extremely
light
and
sportive
or
i
ll
work
him
i
had
heard
of
miss
havisham
up
town
everybody
for
miles
round
had
heard
of
miss
havisham
up
town
as
an
immensely
rich
and
grim
lady
who
lived
in
a
large
and
dismal
house
barricaded
against
robbers
and
who
led
a
life
of
seclusion
well
to
be
sure
said
joe
astounded
i
wonder
how
she
come
to
know
pip
noodle
cried
my
sister
who
said
she
knew
him
which
some
individual
joe
again
politely
hinted
mentioned
that
she
wanted
him
to
go
and
play
there
and
couldn
t
she
ask
uncle
pumblechook
if
he
knew
of
a
boy
to
go
and
play
there
isn
t
it
just
barely
possible
that
uncle
pumblechook
may
be
a
tenant
of
hers
and
that
he
may
sometimes
we
won
t
say
quarterly
or
half
yearly
for
that
would
be
requiring
too
much
of
you
but
sometimes
go
there
to
pay
his
rent
and
couldn
t
she
then
ask
uncle
pumblechook
if
he
knew
of
a
boy
to
go
and
play
there
and
couldn
t
uncle
pumblechook
being
always
considerate
and
thoughtful
for
us
though
you
may
not
think
it
joseph
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
reproach
as
if
he
were
the
most
callous
of
nephews
then
mention
this
boy
standing
prancing
here
which
i
solemnly
declare
i
was
not
doing
that
i
have
for
ever
been
a
willing
slave
to
good
again
cried
uncle
pumblechook
well
put
prettily
pointed
good
indeed
now
joseph
you
know
the
case
no
joseph
said
my
sister
still
in
a
reproachful
manner
while
joe
apologetically
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
and
across
his
nose
you
do
not
yet
though
you
may
not
think
it
know
the
case
you
may
consider
that
you
do
but
you
do
not
joseph
for
you
do
not
know
that
uncle
pumblechook
being
sensible
that
for
anything
we
can
tell
this
boy
s
fortune
may
be
made
by
his
going
to
miss
havisham
s
has
offered
to
take
him
into
town
to
night
in
his
own
chaise
cart
and
to
keep
him
to
night
and
to
take
him
with
his
own
hands
to
miss
havisham
s
to
morrow
morning
and
lor
a
mussy
me
cried
my
sister
casting
off
her
bonnet
in
sudden
desperation
here
i
stand
talking
to
mere
mooncalfs
with
uncle
pumblechook
waiting
and
the
mare
catching
cold
at
the
door
and
the
boy
grimed
with
crock
and
dirt
from
the
hair
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
with
that
she
pounced
upon
me
like
an
eagle
on
a
lamb
and
my
face
was
squeezed
into
wooden
bowls
in
sinks
and
my
head
was
put
under
taps
of
water
butts
and
i
was
soaped
and
kneaded
and
towelled
and
thumped
and
harrowed
and
rasped
until
i
really
was
quite
beside
myself
i
may
here
remark
that
i
suppose
myself
to
be
better
acquainted
than
any
living
authority
with
the
ridgy
effect
of
a
wedding
ring
passing
unsympathetically
over
the
human
countenance
when
my
ablutions
were
completed
i
was
put
into
clean
linen
of
the
stiffest
character
like
a
young
penitent
into
sackcloth
and
was
trussed
up
in
my
tightest
and
fearfullest
suit
i
was
then
delivered
over
to
mr
pumblechook
who
formally
received
me
as
if
he
were
the
sheriff
and
who
let
off
upon
me
the
speech
that
i
knew
he
had
been
dying
to
make
all
along
boy
be
forever
grateful
to
all
friends
but
especially
unto
them
which
brought
you
up
by
hand
good
bye
joe
god
bless
you
pip
old
chap
i
had
never
parted
from
him
before
and
what
with
my
feelings
and
what
with
soapsuds
i
could
at
first
see
no
stars
from
the
chaise
cart
but
they
twinkled
out
one
by
one
without
throwing
any
light
on
the
questions
why
on
earth
i
was
going
to
play
at
miss
havisham
s
and
what
on
earth
i
was
expected
to
play
at
chapter
viii
mr
pumblechook
s
premises
in
the
high
street
of
the
market
town
were
of
a
peppercorny
and
farinaceous
character
as
the
premises
of
a
cornchandler
and
seedsman
should
be
it
appeared
to
me
that
he
must
be
a
very
happy
man
indeed
to
have
so
many
little
drawers
in
his
shop
and
i
wondered
when
i
peeped
into
one
or
two
on
the
lower
tiers
and
saw
the
tied
up
brown
paper
packets
inside
whether
the
flower
seeds
and
bulbs
ever
wanted
of
a
fine
day
to
break
out
of
those
jails
and
bloom
it
was
in
the
early
morning
after
my
arrival
that
i
entertained
this
speculation
on
the
previous
night
i
had
been
sent
straight
to
bed
in
an
attic
with
a
sloping
roof
which
was
so
low
in
the
corner
where
the
bedstead
was
that
i
calculated
the
tiles
as
being
within
a
foot
of
my
eyebrows
in
the
same
early
morning
i
discovered
a
singular
affinity
between
seeds
and
corduroys
mr
pumblechook
wore
corduroys
and
so
did
his
shopman
and
somehow
there
was
a
general
air
and
flavor
about
the
corduroys
so
much
in
the
nature
of
seeds
and
a
general
air
and
flavor
about
the
seeds
so
much
in
the
nature
of
corduroys
that
i
hardly
knew
which
was
which
the
same
opportunity
served
me
for
noticing
that
mr
pumblechook
appeared
to
conduct
his
business
by
looking
across
the
street
at
the
saddler
who
appeared
to
transact
his
business
by
keeping
his
eye
on
the
coachmaker
who
appeared
to
get
on
in
life
by
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
contemplating
the
baker
who
in
his
turn
folded
his
arms
and
stared
at
the
grocer
who
stood
at
his
door
and
yawned
at
the
chemist
the
watchmaker
always
poring
over
a
little
desk
with
a
magnifying
glass
at
his
eye
and
always
inspected
by
a
group
of
smock
frocks
poring
over
him
through
the
glass
of
his
shop
window
seemed
to
be
about
the
only
person
in
the
high
street
whose
trade
engaged
his
attention
mr
pumblechook
and
i
breakfasted
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
parlor
behind
the
shop
while
the
shopman
took
his
mug
of
tea
and
hunch
of
bread
and
butter
on
a
sack
of
peas
in
the
front
premises
i
considered
mr
pumblechook
wretched
company
besides
being
possessed
by
my
sister
s
idea
that
a
mortifying
and
penitential
character
ought
to
be
imparted
to
my
diet
besides
giving
me
as
much
crumb
as
possible
in
combination
with
as
little
butter
and
putting
such
a
quantity
of
warm
water
into
my
milk
that
it
would
have
been
more
candid
to
have
left
the
milk
out
altogether
his
conversation
consisted
of
nothing
but
arithmetic
on
my
politely
bidding
him
good
morning
he
said
pompously
seven
times
nine
boy
and
how
should
i
be
able
to
answer
dodged
in
that
way
in
a
strange
place
on
an
empty
stomach
i
was
hungry
but
before
i
had
swallowed
a
morsel
he
began
a
running
sum
that
lasted
all
through
the
breakfast
seven
and
four
and
eight
and
six
and
two
and
ten
and
so
on
and
after
each
figure
was
disposed
of
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
get
a
bite
or
a
sup
before
the
next
came
while
he
sat
at
his
ease
guessing
nothing
and
eating
bacon
and
hot
roll
in
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
a
gorging
and
gormandizing
manner
for
such
reasons
i
was
very
glad
when
ten
o
clock
came
and
we
started
for
miss
havisham
s
though
i
was
not
at
all
at
my
ease
regarding
the
manner
in
which
i
should
acquit
myself
under
that
lady
s
roof
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
came
to
miss
havisham
s
house
which
was
of
old
brick
and
dismal
and
had
a
great
many
iron
bars
to
it
some
of
the
windows
had
been
walled
up
of
those
that
remained
all
the
lower
were
rustily
barred
there
was
a
courtyard
in
front
and
that
was
barred
so
we
had
to
wait
after
ringing
the
bell
until
some
one
should
come
to
open
it
while
we
waited
at
the
gate
i
peeped
in
even
then
mr
pumblechook
said
and
fourteen
but
i
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
saw
that
at
the
side
of
the
house
there
was
a
large
brewery
no
brewing
was
going
on
in
it
and
none
seemed
to
have
gone
on
for
a
long
long
time
a
window
was
raised
and
a
clear
voice
demanded
what
name
to
which
my
conductor
replied
pumblechook
the
voice
returned
quite
right
and
the
window
was
shut
again
and
a
young
lady
came
across
the
court
yard
with
keys
in
her
hand
this
said
mr
pumblechook
is
pip
this
is
pip
is
it
returned
the
young
lady
who
was
very
pretty
and
seemed
very
proud
come
in
pip
mr
pumblechook
was
coming
in
also
when
she
stopped
him
with
the
gate
oh
she
said
did
you
wish
to
see
miss
havisham
if
miss
havisham
wished
to
see
me
returned
mr
pumblechook
discomfited
ah
said
the
girl
but
you
see
she
don
t
she
said
it
so
finally
and
in
such
an
undiscussible
way
that
mr
pumblechook
though
in
a
condition
of
ruffled
dignity
could
not
protest
but
he
eyed
me
severely
as
if
i
had
done
anything
to
him
and
departed
with
the
words
reproachfully
delivered
boy
let
your
behavior
here
be
a
credit
unto
them
which
brought
you
up
by
hand
i
was
not
free
from
apprehension
that
he
would
come
back
to
propound
through
the
gate
and
sixteen
but
he
didn
t
my
young
conductress
locked
the
gate
and
we
went
across
the
courtyard
it
was
paved
and
clean
but
grass
was
growing
in
every
crevice
the
brewery
buildings
had
a
little
lane
of
communication
with
it
and
the
wooden
gates
of
that
lane
stood
open
and
all
the
brewery
beyond
stood
open
away
to
the
high
enclosing
wall
and
all
was
empty
and
disused
the
cold
wind
seemed
to
blow
colder
there
than
outside
the
gate
and
it
made
a
shrill
noise
in
howling
in
and
out
at
the
open
sides
of
the
brewery
like
the
noise
of
wind
in
the
rigging
of
a
ship
at
sea
she
saw
me
looking
at
it
and
she
said
you
could
drink
without
hurt
all
the
strong
beer
that
s
brewed
there
now
boy
i
should
think
i
could
miss
said
i
in
a
shy
way
better
not
try
to
brew
beer
there
now
or
it
would
turn
out
sour
boy
don
t
you
think
so
it
looks
like
it
miss
not
that
anybody
means
to
try
she
added
for
that
s
all
done
with
and
the
place
will
stand
as
idle
as
it
is
till
it
falls
as
to
strong
beer
there
s
enough
of
it
in
the
cellars
already
to
drown
the
manor
house
is
that
the
name
of
this
house
miss
one
of
its
names
boy
it
has
more
than
one
then
miss
one
more
its
other
name
was
satis
which
is
greek
or
latin
or
hebrew
or
all
three
or
all
one
to
me
for
enough
enough
house
said
i
that
s
a
curious
name
miss
yes
she
replied
but
it
meant
more
than
it
said
it
meant
when
it
was
given
that
whoever
had
this
house
could
want
nothing
else
they
must
have
been
easily
satisfied
in
those
days
i
should
think
but
don
t
loiter
boy
though
she
called
me
boy
so
often
and
with
a
carelessness
that
was
far
from
complimentary
she
was
of
about
my
own
age
she
seemed
much
older
than
i
of
course
being
a
girl
and
beautiful
and
self
possessed
and
she
was
as
scornful
of
me
as
if
she
had
been
one
and
twenty
and
a
queen
we
went
into
the
house
by
a
side
door
the
great
front
entrance
had
two
chains
across
it
outside
and
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
the
passages
were
all
dark
and
that
she
had
left
a
candle
burning
there
she
took
it
up
and
we
went
through
more
passages
and
up
a
staircase
and
still
it
was
all
dark
and
only
the
candle
lighted
us
at
last
we
came
to
the
door
of
a
room
and
she
said
go
in
i
answered
more
in
shyness
than
politeness
after
you
miss
to
this
she
returned
don
t
be
ridiculous
boy
i
am
not
going
in
and
scornfully
walked
away
and
what
was
worse
took
the
candle
with
her
this
was
very
uncomfortable
and
i
was
half
afraid
however
the
only
thing
to
be
done
being
to
knock
at
the
door
i
knocked
and
was
told
from
within
to
enter
i
entered
therefore
and
found
myself
in
a
pretty
large
room
well
lighted
with
wax
candles
no
glimpse
of
daylight
was
to
be
seen
in
it
it
was
a
dressing
room
as
i
supposed
from
the
furniture
though
much
of
it
was
of
forms
and
uses
then
quite
unknown
to
me
but
prominent
in
it
was
a
draped
table
with
a
gilded
looking
glass
and
that
i
made
out
at
first
sight
to
be
a
fine
lady
s
dressing
table
whether
i
should
have
made
out
this
object
so
soon
if
there
had
been
no
fine
lady
sitting
at
it
i
cannot
say
in
an
arm
chair
with
an
elbow
resting
on
the
table
and
her
head
leaning
on
that
hand
sat
the
strangest
lady
i
have
ever
seen
or
shall
ever
see
she
was
dressed
in
rich
materials
satins
and
lace
and
silks
all
of
white
her
shoes
were
white
and
she
had
a
long
white
veil
dependent
from
her
hair
and
she
had
bridal
flowers
in
her
hair
but
her
hair
was
white
some
bright
jewels
sparkled
on
her
neck
and
on
her
hands
and
some
other
jewels
lay
sparkling
on
the
table
dresses
less
splendid
than
the
dress
she
wore
and
half
packed
trunks
were
scattered
about
she
had
not
quite
finished
dressing
for
she
had
but
one
shoe
on
the
other
was
on
the
table
near
her
hand
her
veil
was
but
half
arranged
her
watch
and
chain
were
not
put
on
and
some
lace
for
her
bosom
lay
with
those
trinkets
and
with
her
handkerchief
and
gloves
and
some
flowers
and
a
prayer
book
all
confusedly
heaped
about
the
looking
glass
it
was
not
in
the
first
few
moments
that
i
saw
all
these
things
though
i
saw
more
of
them
in
the
first
moments
than
might
be
supposed
but
i
saw
that
everything
within
my
view
which
ought
to
be
white
had
been
white
long
ago
and
had
lost
its
lustre
and
was
faded
and
yellow
i
saw
that
the
bride
within
the
bridal
dress
had
withered
like
the
dress
and
like
the
flowers
and
had
no
brightness
left
but
the
brightness
of
her
sunken
eyes
i
saw
that
the
dress
had
been
put
upon
the
rounded
figure
of
a
young
woman
and
that
the
figure
upon
which
it
now
hung
loose
had
shrunk
to
skin
and
bone
once
i
had
been
taken
to
see
some
ghastly
waxwork
at
the
fair
representing
i
know
not
what
impossible
personage
lying
in
state
once
i
had
been
taken
to
one
of
our
old
marsh
churches
to
see
a
skeleton
in
the
ashes
of
a
rich
dress
that
had
been
dug
out
of
a
vault
under
the
church
pavement
now
waxwork
and
skeleton
seemed
to
have
dark
eyes
that
moved
and
looked
at
me
i
should
have
cried
out
if
i
could
who
is
it
said
the
lady
at
the
table
pip
ma
am
pip
mr
pumblechook
s
boy
ma
am
come
to
play
come
nearer
let
me
look
at
you
come
close
it
was
when
i
stood
before
her
avoiding
her
eyes
that
i
took
note
of
the
surrounding
objects
in
detail
and
saw
that
her
watch
had
stopped
at
twenty
minutes
to
nine
and
that
a
clock
in
the
room
had
stopped
at
twenty
minutes
to
nine
look
at
me
said
miss
havisham
you
are
not
afraid
of
a
woman
who
has
never
seen
the
sun
since
you
were
born
i
regret
to
state
that
i
was
not
afraid
of
telling
the
enormous
lie
comprehended
in
the
answer
no
do
you
know
what
i
touch
here
she
said
laying
her
hands
one
upon
the
other
on
her
left
side
yes
ma
am
it
made
me
think
of
the
young
man
what
do
i
touch
your
heart
broken
she
uttered
the
word
with
an
eager
look
and
with
strong
emphasis
and
with
a
weird
smile
that
had
a
kind
of
boast
in
it
afterwards
she
kept
her
hands
there
for
a
little
while
and
slowly
took
them
away
as
if
they
were
heavy
i
am
tired
said
miss
havisham
i
want
diversion
and
i
have
done
with
men
and
women
play
i
think
it
will
be
conceded
by
my
most
disputatious
reader
that
she
could
hardly
have
directed
an
unfortunate
boy
to
do
anything
in
the
wide
world
more
difficult
to
be
done
under
the
circumstances
i
sometimes
have
sick
fancies
she
went
on
and
i
have
a
sick
fancy
that
i
want
to
see
some
play
there
there
with
an
impatient
movement
of
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
play
play
play
for
a
moment
with
the
fear
of
my
sister
s
working
me
before
my
eyes
i
had
a
desperate
idea
of
starting
round
the
room
in
the
assumed
character
of
mr
pumblechook
s
chaise
cart
but
i
felt
myself
so
unequal
to
the
performance
that
i
gave
it
up
and
stood
looking
at
miss
havisham
in
what
i
suppose
she
took
for
a
dogged
manner
inasmuch
as
she
said
when
we
had
taken
a
good
look
at
each
other
are
you
sullen
and
obstinate
no
ma
am
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
and
very
sorry
i
can
t
play
just
now
if
you
complain
of
me
i
shall
get
into
trouble
with
my
sister
so
i
would
do
it
if
i
could
but
it
s
so
new
here
and
so
strange
and
so
fine
and
melancholy
i
stopped
fearing
i
might
say
too
much
or
had
already
said
it
and
we
took
another
look
at
each
other
before
she
spoke
again
she
turned
her
eyes
from
me
and
looked
at
the
dress
she
wore
and
at
the
dressing
table
and
finally
at
herself
in
the
looking
glass
so
new
to
him
she
muttered
so
old
to
me
so
strange
to
him
so
familiar
to
me
so
melancholy
to
both
of
us
call
estella
as
she
was
still
looking
at
the
reflection
of
herself
i
thought
she
was
still
talking
to
herself
and
kept
quiet
call
estella
she
repeated
flashing
a
look
at
me
you
can
do
that
call
estella
at
the
door
to
stand
in
the
dark
in
a
mysterious
passage
of
an
unknown
house
bawling
estella
to
a
scornful
young
lady
neither
visible
nor
responsive
and
feeling
it
a
dreadful
liberty
so
to
roar
out
her
name
was
almost
as
bad
as
playing
to
order
but
she
answered
at
last
and
her
light
came
along
the
dark
passage
like
a
star
miss
havisham
beckoned
her
to
come
close
and
took
up
a
jewel
from
the
table
and
tried
its
effect
upon
her
fair
young
bosom
and
against
her
pretty
brown
hair
your
own
one
day
my
dear
and
you
will
use
it
well
let
me
see
you
play
cards
with
this
boy
with
this
boy
why
he
is
a
common
laboring
boy
i
thought
i
overheard
miss
havisham
answer
only
it
seemed
so
unlikely
well
you
can
break
his
heart
what
do
you
play
boy
asked
estella
of
myself
with
the
greatest
disdain
nothing
but
beggar
my
neighbor
miss
beggar
him
said
miss
havisham
to
estella
so
we
sat
down
to
cards
it
was
then
i
began
to
understand
that
everything
in
the
room
had
stopped
like
the
watch
and
the
clock
a
long
time
ago
i
noticed
that
miss
havisham
put
down
the
jewel
exactly
on
the
spot
from
which
she
had
taken
it
up
as
estella
dealt
the
cards
i
glanced
at
the
dressing
table
again
and
saw
that
the
shoe
upon
it
once
white
now
yellow
had
never
been
worn
i
glanced
down
at
the
foot
from
which
the
shoe
was
absent
and
saw
that
the
silk
stocking
on
it
once
white
now
yellow
had
been
trodden
ragged
without
this
arrest
of
everything
this
standing
still
of
all
the
pale
decayed
objects
not
even
the
withered
bridal
dress
on
the
collapsed
form
could
have
looked
so
like
grave
clothes
or
the
long
veil
so
like
a
shroud
so
she
sat
corpse
like
as
we
played
at
cards
the
frillings
and
trimmings
on
her
bridal
dress
looking
like
earthy
paper
i
knew
nothing
then
of
the
discoveries
that
are
occasionally
made
of
bodies
buried
in
ancient
times
which
fall
to
powder
in
the
moment
of
being
distinctly
seen
but
i
have
often
thought
since
that
she
must
have
looked
as
if
the
admission
of
the
natural
light
of
day
would
have
struck
her
to
dust
he
calls
the
knaves
jacks
this
boy
said
estella
with
disdain
before
our
first
game
was
out
and
what
coarse
hands
he
has
and
what
thick
boots
i
had
never
thought
of
being
ashamed
of
my
hands
before
but
i
began
to
consider
them
a
very
indifferent
pair
her
contempt
for
me
was
so
strong
that
it
became
infectious
and
i
caught
it
she
won
the
game
and
i
dealt
i
misdealt
as
was
only
natural
when
i
knew
she
was
lying
in
wait
for
me
to
do
wrong
and
she
denounced
me
for
a
stupid
clumsy
laboring
boy
you
say
nothing
of
her
remarked
miss
havisham
to
me
as
she
looked
on
she
says
many
hard
things
of
you
but
you
say
nothing
of
her
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
don
t
like
to
say
i
stammered
tell
me
in
my
ear
said
miss
havisham
bending
down
i
think
she
is
very
proud
i
replied
in
a
whisper
anything
else
i
think
she
is
very
pretty
anything
else
i
think
she
is
very
insulting
she
was
looking
at
me
then
with
a
look
of
supreme
aversion
anything
else
i
think
i
should
like
to
go
home
and
never
see
her
again
though
she
is
so
pretty
i
am
not
sure
that
i
shouldn
t
like
to
see
her
again
but
i
should
like
to
go
home
now
you
shall
go
soon
said
miss
havisham
aloud
play
the
game
out
saving
for
the
one
weird
smile
at
first
i
should
have
felt
almost
sure
that
miss
havisham
s
face
could
not
smile
it
had
dropped
into
a
watchful
and
brooding
expression
most
likely
when
all
the
things
about
her
had
become
transfixed
and
it
looked
as
if
nothing
could
ever
lift
it
up
again
her
chest
had
dropped
so
that
she
stooped
and
her
voice
had
dropped
so
that
she
spoke
low
and
with
a
dead
lull
upon
her
altogether
she
had
the
appearance
of
having
dropped
body
and
soul
within
and
without
under
the
weight
of
a
crushing
blow
i
played
the
game
to
an
end
with
estella
and
she
beggared
me
she
threw
the
cards
down
on
the
table
when
she
had
won
them
all
as
if
she
despised
them
for
having
been
won
of
me
when
shall
i
have
you
here
again
said
miss
havisham
let
me
think
i
was
beginning
to
remind
her
that
to
day
was
wednesday
when
she
checked
me
with
her
former
impatient
movement
of
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
there
there
i
know
nothing
of
days
of
the
week
i
know
nothing
of
weeks
of
the
year
come
again
after
six
days
you
hear
yes
ma
am
estella
take
him
down
let
him
have
something
to
eat
and
let
him
roam
and
look
about
him
while
he
eats
go
pip
i
followed
the
candle
down
as
i
had
followed
the
candle
up
and
she
stood
it
in
the
place
where
we
had
found
it
until
she
opened
the
side
entrance
i
had
fancied
without
thinking
about
it
that
it
must
necessarily
be
night
time
the
rush
of
the
daylight
quite
confounded
me
and
made
me
feel
as
if
i
had
been
in
the
candlelight
of
the
strange
room
many
hours
you
are
to
wait
here
you
boy
said
estella
and
disappeared
and
closed
the
door
i
took
the
opportunity
of
being
alone
in
the
courtyard
to
look
at
my
coarse
hands
and
my
common
boots
my
opinion
of
those
accessories
was
not
favorable
they
had
never
troubled
me
before
but
they
troubled
me
now
as
vulgar
appendages
i
determined
to
ask
joe
why
he
had
ever
taught
me
to
call
those
picture
cards
jacks
which
ought
to
be
called
knaves
i
wished
joe
had
been
rather
more
genteelly
brought
up
and
then
i
should
have
been
so
too
she
came
back
with
some
bread
and
meat
and
a
little
mug
of
beer
she
put
the
mug
down
on
the
stones
of
the
yard
and
gave
me
the
bread
and
meat
without
looking
at
me
as
insolently
as
if
i
were
a
dog
in
disgrace
i
was
so
humiliated
hurt
spurned
offended
angry
sorry
i
cannot
hit
upon
the
right
name
for
the
smart
god
knows
what
its
name
was
that
tears
started
to
my
eyes
the
moment
they
sprang
there
the
girl
looked
at
me
with
a
quick
delight
in
having
been
the
cause
of
them
this
gave
me
power
to
keep
them
back
and
to
look
at
her
so
she
gave
a
contemptuous
toss
but
with
a
sense
i
thought
of
having
made
too
sure
that
i
was
so
wounded
and
left
me
but
when
she
was
gone
i
looked
about
me
for
a
place
to
hide
my
face
in
and
got
behind
one
of
the
gates
in
the
brewery
lane
and
leaned
my
sleeve
against
the
wall
there
and
leaned
my
forehead
on
it
and
cried
as
i
cried
i
kicked
the
wall
and
took
a
hard
twist
at
my
hair
so
bitter
were
my
feelings
and
so
sharp
was
the
smart
without
a
name
that
needed
counteraction
my
sister
s
bringing
up
had
made
me
sensitive
in
the
little
world
in
which
children
have
their
existence
whosoever
brings
them
up
there
is
nothing
so
finely
perceived
and
so
finely
felt
as
injustice
it
may
be
only
small
injustice
that
the
child
can
be
exposed
to
but
the
child
is
small
and
its
world
is
small
and
its
rocking
horse
stands
as
many
hands
high
according
to
scale
as
a
big
boned
irish
hunter
within
myself
i
had
sustained
from
my
babyhood
a
perpetual
conflict
with
injustice
i
had
known
from
the
time
when
i
could
speak
that
my
sister
in
her
capricious
and
violent
coercion
was
unjust
to
me
i
had
cherished
a
profound
conviction
that
her
bringing
me
up
by
hand
gave
her
no
right
to
bring
me
up
by
jerks
through
all
my
punishments
disgraces
fasts
and
vigils
and
other
penitential
performances
i
had
nursed
this
assurance
and
to
my
communing
so
much
with
it
in
a
solitary
and
unprotected
way
i
in
great
part
refer
the
fact
that
i
was
morally
timid
and
very
sensitive
i
got
rid
of
my
injured
feelings
for
the
time
by
kicking
them
into
the
brewery
wall
and
twisting
them
out
of
my
hair
and
then
i
smoothed
my
face
with
my
sleeve
and
came
from
behind
the
gate
the
bread
and
meat
were
acceptable
and
the
beer
was
warming
and
tingling
and
i
was
soon
in
spirits
to
look
about
me
to
be
sure
it
was
a
deserted
place
down
to
the
pigeon
house
in
the
brewery
yard
which
had
been
blown
crooked
on
its
pole
by
some
high
wind
and
would
have
made
the
pigeons
think
themselves
at
sea
if
there
had
been
any
pigeons
there
to
be
rocked
by
it
but
there
were
no
pigeons
in
the
dove
cot
no
horses
in
the
stable
no
pigs
in
the
sty
no
malt
in
the
storehouse
no
smells
of
grains
and
beer
in
the
copper
or
the
vat
all
the
uses
and
scents
of
the
brewery
might
have
evaporated
with
its
last
reek
of
smoke
in
a
by
yard
there
was
a
wilderness
of
empty
casks
which
had
a
certain
sour
remembrance
of
better
days
lingering
about
them
but
it
was
too
sour
to
be
accepted
as
a
sample
of
the
beer
that
was
gone
and
in
this
respect
i
remember
those
recluses
as
being
like
most
others
behind
the
furthest
end
of
the
brewery
was
a
rank
garden
with
an
old
wall
not
so
high
but
that
i
could
struggle
up
and
hold
on
long
enough
to
look
over
it
and
see
that
the
rank
garden
was
the
garden
of
the
house
and
that
it
was
overgrown
with
tangled
weeds
but
that
there
was
a
track
upon
the
green
and
yellow
paths
as
if
some
one
sometimes
walked
there
and
that
estella
was
walking
away
from
me
even
then
but
she
seemed
to
be
everywhere
for
when
i
yielded
to
the
temptation
presented
by
the
casks
and
began
to
walk
on
them
i
saw
her
walking
on
them
at
the
end
of
the
yard
of
casks
she
had
her
back
towards
me
and
held
her
pretty
brown
hair
spread
out
in
her
two
hands
and
never
looked
round
and
passed
out
of
my
view
directly
so
in
the
brewery
itself
by
which
i
mean
the
large
paved
lofty
place
in
which
they
used
to
make
the
beer
and
where
the
brewing
utensils
still
were
when
i
first
went
into
it
and
rather
oppressed
by
its
gloom
stood
near
the
door
looking
about
me
i
saw
her
pass
among
the
extinguished
fires
and
ascend
some
light
iron
stairs
and
go
out
by
a
gallery
high
overhead
as
if
she
were
going
out
into
the
sky
it
was
in
this
place
and
at
this
moment
that
a
strange
thing
happened
to
my
fancy
i
thought
it
a
strange
thing
then
and
i
thought
it
a
stranger
thing
long
afterwards
i
turned
my
eyes
a
little
dimmed
by
looking
up
at
the
frosty
light
towards
a
great
wooden
beam
in
a
low
nook
of
the
building
near
me
on
my
right
hand
and
i
saw
a
figure
hanging
there
by
the
neck
a
figure
all
in
yellow
white
with
but
one
shoe
to
the
feet
and
it
hung
so
that
i
could
see
that
the
faded
trimmings
of
the
dress
were
like
earthy
paper
and
that
the
face
was
miss
havisham
s
with
a
movement
going
over
the
whole
countenance
as
if
she
were
trying
to
call
to
me
in
the
terror
of
seeing
the
figure
and
in
the
terror
of
being
certain
that
it
had
not
been
there
a
moment
before
i
at
first
ran
from
it
and
then
ran
towards
it
and
my
terror
was
greatest
of
all
when
i
found
no
figure
there
nothing
less
than
the
frosty
light
of
the
cheerful
sky
the
sight
of
people
passing
beyond
the
bars
of
the
court
yard
gate
and
the
reviving
influence
of
the
rest
of
the
bread
and
meat
and
beer
would
have
brought
me
round
even
with
those
aids
i
might
not
have
come
to
myself
as
soon
as
i
did
but
that
i
saw
estella
approaching
with
the
keys
to
let
me
out
she
would
have
some
fair
reason
for
looking
down
upon
me
i
thought
if
she
saw
me
frightened
and
she
would
have
no
fair
reason
she
gave
me
a
triumphant
glance
in
passing
me
as
if
she
rejoiced
that
my
hands
were
so
coarse
and
my
boots
were
so
thick
and
she
opened
the
gate
and
stood
holding
it
i
was
passing
out
without
looking
at
her
when
she
touched
me
with
a
taunting
hand
why
don
t
you
cry
because
i
don
t
want
to
you
do
said
she
you
have
been
crying
till
you
are
half
blind
and
you
are
near
crying
again
now
she
laughed
contemptuously
pushed
me
out
and
locked
the
gate
upon
me
i
went
straight
to
mr
pumblechook
s
and
was
immensely
relieved
to
find
him
not
at
home
so
leaving
word
with
the
shopman
on
what
day
i
was
wanted
at
miss
havisham
s
again
i
set
off
on
the
four
mile
walk
to
our
forge
pondering
as
i
went
along
on
all
i
had
seen
and
deeply
revolving
that
i
was
a
common
laboring
boy
that
my
hands
were
coarse
that
my
boots
were
thick
that
i
had
fallen
into
a
despicable
habit
of
calling
knaves
jacks
that
i
was
much
more
ignorant
than
i
had
considered
myself
last
night
and
generally
that
i
was
in
a
low
lived
bad
way
chapter
ix
when
i
reached
home
my
sister
was
very
curious
to
know
all
about
miss
havisham
s
and
asked
a
number
of
questions
and
i
soon
found
myself
getting
heavily
bumped
from
behind
in
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
the
small
of
the
back
and
having
my
face
ignominiously
shoved
against
the
kitchen
wall
because
i
did
not
answer
those
questions
at
sufficient
length
if
a
dread
of
not
being
understood
be
hidden
in
the
breasts
of
other
young
people
to
anything
like
the
extent
to
which
it
used
to
be
hidden
in
mine
which
i
consider
probable
as
i
have
no
particular
reason
to
suspect
myself
of
having
been
a
monstrosity
it
is
the
key
to
many
reservations
i
felt
convinced
that
if
i
described
miss
havisham
s
as
my
eyes
had
seen
it
i
should
not
be
understood
not
only
that
but
i
felt
convinced
that
miss
havisham
too
would
not
be
understood
and
although
she
was
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
me
i
entertained
an
impression
that
there
would
be
something
coarse
and
treacherous
in
my
dragging
her
as
she
really
was
to
say
nothing
of
miss
estella
before
the
contemplation
of
mrs
joe
consequently
i
said
as
little
as
i
could
and
had
my
face
shoved
against
the
kitchen
wall
the
worst
of
it
was
that
that
bullying
old
pumblechook
preyed
upon
by
a
devouring
curiosity
to
be
informed
of
all
i
had
seen
and
heard
came
gaping
over
in
his
chaise
cart
at
tea
time
to
have
the
details
divulged
to
him
and
the
mere
sight
of
the
torment
with
his
fishy
eyes
and
mouth
open
his
sandy
hair
inquisitively
on
end
and
his
waistcoat
heaving
with
windy
arithmetic
made
me
vicious
in
my
reticence
well
boy
uncle
pumblechook
began
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
in
the
chair
of
honor
by
the
fire
how
did
you
get
on
up
town
i
answered
pretty
well
sir
and
my
sister
shook
her
fist
at
me
pretty
well
mr
pumblechook
repeated
pretty
well
is
no
answer
tell
us
what
you
mean
by
pretty
well
boy
whitewash
on
the
forehead
hardens
the
brain
into
a
state
of
obstinacy
perhaps
anyhow
with
whitewash
from
the
wall
on
my
forehead
my
obstinacy
was
adamantine
i
reflected
for
some
time
and
then
answered
as
if
i
had
discovered
a
new
idea
i
mean
pretty
well
my
sister
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
was
going
to
fly
at
me
i
had
no
shadow
of
defence
for
joe
was
busy
in
the
forge
when
mr
pumblechook
interposed
with
no
don
t
lose
your
temper
leave
this
lad
to
me
ma
am
leave
this
lad
to
me
mr
pumblechook
then
turned
me
towards
him
as
if
he
were
going
to
cut
my
hair
and
said
first
to
get
our
thoughts
in
order
forty
three
pence
i
calculated
the
consequences
of
replying
four
hundred
pound
and
finding
them
against
me
went
as
near
the
answer
as
i
could
which
was
somewhere
about
eightpence
off
mr
pumblechook
then
put
me
through
my
pence
table
from
twelve
pence
make
one
shilling
up
to
forty
pence
make
three
and
fourpence
and
then
triumphantly
demanded
as
if
he
had
done
for
me
now
how
much
is
forty
three
pence
to
which
i
replied
after
a
long
interval
of
reflection
i
don
t
know
and
i
was
so
aggravated
that
i
almost
doubt
if
i
did
know
mr
pumblechook
worked
his
head
like
a
screw
to
screw
it
out
of
me
and
said
is
forty
three
pence
seven
and
sixpence
three
fardens
for
instance
yes
said
i
and
although
my
sister
instantly
boxed
my
ears
it
was
highly
gratifying
to
me
to
see
that
the
answer
spoilt
his
joke
and
brought
him
to
a
dead
stop
boy
what
like
is
miss
havisham
mr
pumblechook
began
again
when
he
had
recovered
folding
his
arms
tight
on
his
chest
and
applying
the
screw
very
tall
and
dark
i
told
him
is
she
uncle
asked
my
sister
mr
pumblechook
winked
assent
from
which
i
at
once
inferred
that
he
had
never
seen
miss
havisham
for
she
was
nothing
of
the
kind
good
said
mr
pumblechook
conceitedly
this
is
the
way
to
have
him
we
are
beginning
to
hold
our
own
i
think
mum
i
am
sure
uncle
returned
mrs
joe
i
wish
you
had
him
always
you
know
so
well
how
to
deal
with
him
now
boy
what
was
she
a
doing
of
when
you
went
in
today
asked
mr
pumblechook
she
was
sitting
i
answered
in
a
black
velvet
coach
mr
pumblechook
and
mrs
joe
stared
at
one
another
as
they
well
might
and
both
repeated
in
a
black
velvet
coach
yes
said
i
and
miss
estella
that
s
her
niece
i
think
handed
her
in
cake
and
wine
at
the
coach
window
on
a
gold
plate
and
we
all
had
cake
and
wine
on
gold
plates
and
i
got
up
behind
the
coach
to
eat
mine
because
she
told
me
to
was
anybody
else
there
asked
mr
pumblechook
four
dogs
said
i
large
or
small
immense
said
i
and
they
fought
for
veal
cutlets
out
of
a
silver
basket
mr
pumblechook
and
mrs
joe
stared
at
one
another
again
in
utter
amazement
i
was
perfectly
frantic
a
reckless
witness
under
the
torture
and
would
have
told
them
anything
where
was
this
coach
in
the
name
of
gracious
asked
my
sister
in
miss
havisham
s
room
they
stared
again
but
there
weren
t
any
horses
to
it
i
added
this
saving
clause
in
the
moment
of
rejecting
four
richly
caparisoned
coursers
which
i
had
had
wild
thoughts
of
harnessing
can
this
be
possible
uncle
asked
mrs
joe
what
can
the
boy
mean
i
ll
tell
you
mum
said
mr
pumblechook
my
opinion
is
it
s
a
sedan
chair
she
s
flighty
you
know
very
flighty
quite
flighty
enough
to
pass
her
days
in
a
sedan
chair
did
you
ever
see
her
in
it
uncle
asked
mrs
joe
how
could
i
he
returned
forced
to
the
admission
when
i
never
see
her
in
my
life
never
clapped
eyes
upon
her
goodness
uncle
and
yet
you
have
spoken
to
her
why
don
t
you
know
said
mr
pumblechook
testily
that
when
i
have
been
there
i
have
been
took
up
to
the
outside
of
her
door
and
the
door
has
stood
ajar
and
she
has
spoke
to
me
that
way
don
t
say
you
don
t
know
that
mum
howsever
the
boy
went
there
to
play
what
did
you
play
at
boy
we
played
with
flags
i
said
i
beg
to
observe
that
i
think
of
myself
with
amazement
when
i
recall
the
lies
i
told
on
this
occasion
flags
echoed
my
sister
yes
said
i
estella
waved
a
blue
flag
and
i
waved
a
red
one
and
miss
havisham
waved
one
sprinkled
all
over
with
little
gold
stars
out
at
the
coach
window
and
then
we
all
waved
our
swords
and
hurrahed
swords
repeated
my
sister
where
did
you
get
swords
from
out
of
a
cupboard
said
i
and
i
saw
pistols
in
it
and
jam
and
pills
and
there
was
no
daylight
in
the
room
but
it
was
all
lighted
up
with
candles
that
s
true
mum
said
mr
pumblechook
with
a
grave
nod
that
s
the
state
of
the
case
for
that
much
i
ve
seen
myself
and
then
they
both
stared
at
me
and
i
with
an
obtrusive
show
of
artlessness
on
my
countenance
stared
at
them
and
plaited
the
right
leg
of
my
trousers
with
my
right
hand
if
they
had
asked
me
any
more
questions
i
should
undoubtedly
have
betrayed
myself
for
i
was
even
then
on
the
point
of
mentioning
that
there
was
a
balloon
in
the
yard
and
should
have
hazarded
the
statement
but
for
my
invention
being
divided
between
that
phenomenon
and
a
bear
in
the
brewery
they
were
so
much
occupied
however
in
discussing
the
marvels
i
had
already
presented
for
their
consideration
that
i
escaped
the
subject
still
held
them
when
joe
came
in
from
his
work
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
to
whom
my
sister
more
for
the
relief
of
her
own
mind
than
for
the
gratification
of
his
related
my
pretended
experiences
now
when
i
saw
joe
open
his
blue
eyes
and
roll
them
all
round
the
kitchen
in
helpless
amazement
i
was
overtaken
by
penitence
but
only
as
regarded
him
not
in
the
least
as
regarded
the
other
two
towards
joe
and
joe
only
i
considered
myself
a
young
monster
while
they
sat
debating
what
results
would
come
to
me
from
miss
havisham
s
acquaintance
and
favor
they
had
no
doubt
that
miss
havisham
would
do
something
for
me
their
doubts
related
to
the
form
that
something
would
take
my
sister
stood
out
for
property
mr
pumblechook
was
in
favor
of
a
handsome
premium
for
binding
me
apprentice
to
some
genteel
trade
say
the
corn
and
seed
trade
for
instance
joe
fell
into
the
deepest
disgrace
with
both
for
offering
the
bright
suggestion
that
i
might
only
be
presented
with
one
of
the
dogs
who
had
fought
for
the
veal
cutlets
if
a
fool
s
head
can
t
express
better
opinions
than
that
said
my
sister
and
you
have
got
any
work
to
do
you
had
better
go
and
do
it
so
he
went
after
mr
pumblechook
had
driven
off
and
when
my
sister
was
washing
up
i
stole
into
the
forge
to
joe
and
remained
by
him
until
he
had
done
for
the
night
then
i
said
before
the
fire
goes
out
joe
i
should
like
to
tell
you
something
should
you
pip
said
joe
drawing
his
shoeing
stool
near
the
forge
then
tell
us
what
is
it
pip
joe
said
i
taking
hold
of
his
rolled
up
shirt
sleeve
and
twisting
it
between
my
finger
and
thumb
you
remember
all
that
about
miss
havisham
s
remember
said
joe
i
believe
you
wonderful
it
s
a
terrible
thing
joe
it
ain
t
true
what
are
you
telling
of
pip
cried
joe
falling
back
in
the
greatest
amazement
you
don
t
mean
to
say
it
s
yes
i
do
it
s
lies
joe
but
not
all
of
it
why
sure
you
don
t
mean
to
say
pip
that
there
was
no
black
welwet
co
ch
for
i
stood
shaking
my
head
but
at
least
there
was
dogs
pip
come
pip
said
joe
persuasively
if
there
warn
t
no
weal
cutlets
at
least
there
was
dogs
no
joe
a
dog
said
joe
a
puppy
come
no
joe
there
was
nothing
at
all
of
the
kind
as
i
fixed
my
eyes
hopelessly
on
joe
joe
contemplated
me
in
dismay
pip
old
chap
this
won
t
do
old
fellow
i
say
where
do
you
expect
to
go
to
it
s
terrible
joe
ain
t
it
terrible
cried
joe
awful
what
possessed
you
i
don
t
know
what
possessed
me
joe
i
replied
letting
his
shirt
sleeve
go
and
sitting
down
in
the
ashes
at
his
feet
hanging
my
head
but
i
wish
you
hadn
t
taught
me
to
call
knaves
at
cards
jacks
and
i
wish
my
boots
weren
t
so
thick
nor
my
hands
so
coarse
and
then
i
told
joe
that
i
felt
very
miserable
and
that
i
hadn
t
been
able
to
explain
myself
to
mrs
joe
and
pumblechook
who
were
so
rude
to
me
and
that
there
had
been
a
beautiful
young
lady
at
miss
havisham
s
who
was
dreadfully
proud
and
that
she
had
said
i
was
common
and
that
i
knew
i
was
common
and
that
i
wished
i
was
not
common
and
that
the
lies
had
come
of
it
somehow
though
i
didn
t
know
how
this
was
a
case
of
metaphysics
at
least
as
difficult
for
joe
to
deal
with
as
for
me
but
joe
took
the
case
altogether
out
of
the
region
of
metaphysics
and
by
that
means
vanquished
it
there
s
one
thing
you
may
be
sure
of
pip
said
joe
after
some
rumination
namely
that
lies
is
lies
howsever
they
come
they
didn
t
ought
to
come
and
they
come
from
the
father
of
lies
and
work
round
to
the
same
don
t
you
tell
no
more
of
em
pip
that
ain
t
the
way
to
get
out
of
being
common
old
chap
and
as
to
being
common
i
don
t
make
it
out
at
all
clear
you
are
oncommon
in
some
things
you
re
oncommon
small
likewise
you
re
a
oncommon
scholar
no
i
am
ignorant
and
backward
joe
why
see
what
a
letter
you
wrote
last
night
wrote
in
print
even
i
ve
seen
letters
ah
and
from
gentlefolks
that
i
ll
swear
weren
t
wrote
in
print
said
joe
i
have
learnt
next
to
nothing
joe
you
think
much
of
me
it
s
only
that
well
pip
said
joe
be
it
so
or
be
it
son
t
you
must
be
a
common
scholar
afore
you
can
be
a
oncommon
one
i
should
hope
the
king
upon
his
throne
with
his
crown
upon
his
ed
can
t
sit
and
write
his
acts
of
parliament
in
print
without
having
begun
when
he
were
a
unpromoted
prince
with
the
alphabet
ah
added
joe
with
a
shake
of
the
head
that
was
full
of
meaning
and
begun
at
a
too
and
worked
his
way
to
z
and
i
know
what
that
is
to
do
though
i
can
t
say
i
ve
exactly
done
it
there
was
some
hope
in
this
piece
of
wisdom
and
it
rather
encouraged
me
whether
common
ones
as
to
callings
and
earnings
pursued
joe
reflectively
mightn
t
be
the
better
of
continuing
for
to
keep
company
with
common
ones
instead
of
going
out
to
play
with
oncommon
ones
which
reminds
me
to
hope
that
there
were
a
flag
perhaps
no
joe
i
m
sorry
there
weren
t
a
flag
pip
whether
that
might
be
or
mightn
t
be
is
a
thing
as
can
t
be
looked
into
now
without
putting
your
sister
on
the
rampage
and
that
s
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
of
as
being
done
intentional
lookee
here
pip
at
what
is
said
to
you
by
a
true
friend
which
this
to
you
the
true
friend
say
if
you
can
t
get
to
be
oncommon
through
going
straight
you
ll
never
get
to
do
it
through
going
crooked
so
don
t
tell
no
more
on
em
pip
and
live
well
and
die
happy
you
are
not
angry
with
me
joe
no
old
chap
but
bearing
in
mind
that
them
were
which
i
meantersay
of
a
stunning
and
outdacious
sort
alluding
to
them
which
bordered
on
weal
cutlets
and
dog
fighting
a
sincere
well
wisher
would
adwise
pip
their
being
dropped
into
your
meditations
when
you
go
up
stairs
to
bed
that
s
all
old
chap
and
don
t
never
do
it
no
more
when
i
got
up
to
my
little
room
and
said
my
prayers
i
did
not
forget
joe
s
recommendation
and
yet
my
young
mind
was
in
that
disturbed
and
unthankful
state
that
i
thought
long
after
i
laid
me
down
how
common
estella
would
consider
joe
a
mere
blacksmith
how
thick
his
boots
and
how
coarse
his
hands
i
thought
how
joe
and
my
sister
were
then
sitting
in
the
kitchen
and
how
i
had
come
up
to
bed
from
the
kitchen
and
how
miss
havisham
and
estella
never
sat
in
a
kitchen
but
were
far
above
the
level
of
such
common
doings
i
fell
asleep
recalling
what
i
used
to
do
when
i
was
at
miss
havisham
s
as
though
i
had
been
there
weeks
or
months
instead
of
hours
and
as
though
it
were
quite
an
old
subject
of
remembrance
instead
of
one
that
had
arisen
only
that
day
that
was
a
memorable
day
to
me
for
it
made
great
changes
in
me
but
it
is
the
same
with
any
life
imagine
one
selected
day
struck
out
of
it
and
think
how
different
its
course
would
have
been
pause
you
who
read
this
and
think
for
a
moment
of
the
long
chain
of
iron
or
gold
of
thorns
or
flowers
that
would
never
have
bound
you
but
for
the
formation
of
the
first
link
on
one
memorable
day
chapter
x
the
felicitous
idea
occurred
to
me
a
morning
or
two
later
when
i
woke
that
the
best
step
i
could
take
towards
making
myself
uncommon
was
to
get
out
of
biddy
everything
she
knew
in
pursuance
of
this
luminous
conception
i
mentioned
to
biddy
when
i
went
to
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
s
at
night
that
i
had
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
get
on
in
life
and
that
i
should
feel
very
much
obliged
to
her
if
she
would
impart
all
her
learning
to
me
biddy
who
was
the
most
obliging
of
girls
immediately
said
she
would
and
indeed
began
to
carry
out
her
promise
within
five
minutes
the
educational
scheme
or
course
established
by
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
may
be
resolved
into
the
following
synopsis
the
pupils
ate
apples
and
put
straws
down
one
another
s
backs
until
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
collected
her
energies
and
made
an
indiscriminate
totter
at
them
with
a
birch
rod
after
receiving
the
charge
with
every
mark
of
derision
the
pupils
formed
in
line
and
buzzingly
passed
a
ragged
book
from
hand
to
hand
the
book
had
an
alphabet
in
it
some
figures
and
tables
and
a
little
spelling
that
is
to
say
it
had
had
once
as
soon
as
this
volume
began
to
circulate
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
fell
into
a
state
of
coma
arising
either
from
sleep
or
a
rheumatic
paroxysm
the
pupils
then
entered
among
themselves
upon
a
competitive
examination
on
the
subject
of
boots
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
who
could
tread
the
hardest
upon
whose
toes
this
mental
exercise
lasted
until
biddy
made
a
rush
at
them
and
distributed
three
defaced
bibles
shaped
as
if
they
had
been
unskilfully
cut
off
the
chump
end
of
something
more
illegibly
printed
at
the
best
than
any
curiosities
of
literature
i
have
since
met
with
speckled
all
over
with
ironmould
and
having
various
specimens
of
the
insect
world
smashed
between
their
leaves
this
part
of
the
course
was
usually
lightened
by
several
single
combats
between
biddy
and
refractory
students
when
the
fights
were
over
biddy
gave
out
the
number
of
a
page
and
then
we
all
read
aloud
what
we
could
or
what
we
couldn
t
in
a
frightful
chorus
biddy
leading
with
a
high
shrill
monotonous
voice
and
none
of
us
having
the
least
notion
of
or
reverence
for
what
we
were
reading
about
when
this
horrible
din
had
lasted
a
certain
time
it
mechanically
awoke
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
who
staggered
at
a
boy
fortuitously
and
pulled
his
ears
this
was
understood
to
terminate
the
course
for
the
evening
and
we
emerged
into
the
air
with
shrieks
of
intellectual
victory
it
is
fair
to
remark
that
there
was
no
prohibition
against
any
pupil
s
entertaining
himself
with
a
slate
or
even
with
the
ink
when
there
was
any
but
that
it
was
not
easy
to
pursue
that
branch
of
study
in
the
winter
season
on
account
of
the
little
general
shop
in
which
the
classes
were
holden
and
which
was
also
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
s
sitting
room
and
bedchamber
being
but
faintly
illuminated
through
the
agency
of
one
low
spirited
dip
candle
and
no
snuffers
it
appeared
to
me
that
it
would
take
time
to
become
uncommon
under
these
circumstances
nevertheless
i
resolved
to
try
it
and
that
very
evening
biddy
entered
on
our
special
agreement
by
imparting
some
information
from
her
little
catalogue
of
prices
under
the
head
of
moist
sugar
and
lending
me
to
copy
at
home
a
large
old
english
d
which
she
had
imitated
from
the
heading
of
some
newspaper
and
which
i
supposed
until
she
told
me
what
it
was
to
be
a
design
for
a
buckle
of
course
there
was
a
public
house
in
the
village
and
of
course
joe
liked
sometimes
to
smoke
his
pipe
there
i
had
received
strict
orders
from
my
sister
to
call
for
him
at
the
three
jolly
bargemen
that
evening
on
my
way
from
school
and
bring
him
home
at
my
peril
to
the
three
jolly
bargemen
therefore
i
directed
my
steps
there
was
a
bar
at
the
jolly
bargemen
with
some
alarmingly
long
chalk
scores
in
it
on
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
door
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
never
paid
off
they
had
been
there
ever
since
i
could
remember
and
had
grown
more
than
i
had
but
there
was
a
quantity
of
chalk
about
our
country
and
perhaps
the
people
neglected
no
opportunity
of
turning
it
to
account
it
being
saturday
night
i
found
the
landlord
looking
rather
grimly
at
these
records
but
as
my
business
was
with
joe
and
not
with
him
i
merely
wished
him
good
evening
and
passed
into
the
common
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
where
there
was
a
bright
large
kitchen
fire
and
where
joe
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
company
with
mr
wopsle
and
a
stranger
joe
greeted
me
as
usual
with
halloa
pip
old
chap
and
the
moment
he
said
that
the
stranger
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
me
he
was
a
secret
looking
man
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
his
head
was
all
on
one
side
and
one
of
his
eyes
was
half
shut
up
as
if
he
were
taking
aim
at
something
with
an
invisible
gun
he
had
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
he
took
it
out
and
after
slowly
blowing
all
his
smoke
away
and
looking
hard
at
me
all
the
time
nodded
so
i
nodded
and
then
he
nodded
again
and
made
room
on
the
settle
beside
him
that
i
might
sit
down
there
but
as
i
was
used
to
sit
beside
joe
whenever
i
entered
that
place
of
resort
i
said
no
thank
you
sir
and
fell
into
the
space
joe
made
for
me
on
the
opposite
settle
the
strange
man
after
glancing
at
joe
and
seeing
that
his
attention
was
otherwise
engaged
nodded
to
me
again
when
i
had
taken
my
seat
and
then
rubbed
his
leg
in
a
very
odd
way
as
it
struck
me
you
was
saying
said
the
strange
man
turning
to
joe
that
you
was
a
blacksmith
yes
i
said
it
you
know
said
joe
what
ll
you
drink
mr
you
didn
t
mention
your
name
by
the
bye
joe
mentioned
it
now
and
the
strange
man
called
him
by
it
what
ll
you
drink
mr
gargery
at
my
expense
to
top
up
with
well
said
joe
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
ain
t
much
in
the
habit
of
drinking
at
anybody
s
expense
but
my
own
habit
no
returned
the
stranger
but
once
and
away
and
on
a
saturday
night
too
come
put
a
name
to
it
mr
gargery
i
wouldn
t
wish
to
be
stiff
company
said
joe
rum
rum
repeated
the
stranger
and
will
the
other
gentleman
originate
a
sentiment
rum
said
mr
wopsle
three
rums
cried
the
stranger
calling
to
the
landlord
glasses
round
this
other
gentleman
observed
joe
by
way
of
introducing
mr
wopsle
is
a
gentleman
that
you
would
like
to
hear
give
it
out
our
clerk
at
church
aha
said
the
stranger
quickly
and
cocking
his
eye
at
me
the
lonely
church
right
out
on
the
marshes
with
graves
round
it
that
s
it
said
joe
the
stranger
with
a
comfortable
kind
of
grunt
over
his
pipe
put
his
legs
up
on
the
settle
that
he
had
to
himself
he
wore
a
flapping
broad
brimmed
traveller
s
hat
and
under
it
a
handkerchief
tied
over
his
head
in
the
manner
of
a
cap
so
that
he
showed
no
hair
as
he
looked
at
the
fire
i
thought
i
saw
a
cunning
expression
followed
by
a
half
laugh
come
into
his
face
i
am
not
acquainted
with
this
country
gentlemen
but
it
seems
a
solitary
country
towards
the
river
most
marshes
is
solitary
said
joe
no
doubt
no
doubt
do
you
find
any
gypsies
now
or
tramps
or
vagrants
of
any
sort
out
there
no
said
joe
none
but
a
runaway
convict
now
and
then
and
we
don
t
find
them
easy
eh
mr
wopsle
mr
wopsle
with
a
majestic
remembrance
of
old
discomfiture
assented
but
not
warmly
seems
you
have
been
out
after
such
asked
the
stranger
once
returned
joe
not
that
we
wanted
to
take
them
you
understand
we
went
out
as
lookers
on
me
and
mr
wopsle
and
pip
didn
t
us
pip
yes
joe
the
stranger
looked
at
me
again
still
cocking
his
eye
as
if
he
were
expressly
taking
aim
at
me
with
his
invisible
gun
and
said
he
s
a
likely
young
parcel
of
bones
that
what
is
it
you
call
him
pip
said
joe
christened
pip
no
not
christened
pip
surname
pip
no
said
joe
it
s
a
kind
of
family
name
what
he
gave
himself
when
a
infant
and
is
called
by
son
of
yours
well
said
joe
meditatively
not
of
course
that
it
could
be
in
anywise
necessary
to
consider
about
it
but
because
it
was
the
way
at
the
jolly
bargemen
to
seem
to
consider
deeply
about
everything
that
was
discussed
over
pipes
well
no
no
he
ain
t
nevvy
said
the
strange
man
well
said
joe
with
the
same
appearance
of
profound
cogitation
he
is
not
no
not
to
deceive
you
he
is
not
my
nevvy
what
the
blue
blazes
is
he
asked
the
stranger
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
an
inquiry
of
unnecessary
strength
mr
wopsle
struck
in
upon
that
as
one
who
knew
all
about
relationships
having
professional
occasion
to
bear
in
mind
what
female
relations
a
man
might
not
marry
and
expounded
the
ties
between
me
and
joe
having
his
hand
in
mr
wopsle
finished
off
with
a
most
terrifically
snarling
passage
from
richard
the
third
and
seemed
to
think
he
had
done
quite
enough
to
account
for
it
when
he
added
as
the
poet
says
and
here
i
may
remark
that
when
mr
wopsle
referred
to
me
he
considered
it
a
necessary
part
of
such
reference
to
rumple
my
hair
and
poke
it
into
my
eyes
i
cannot
conceive
why
everybody
of
his
standing
who
visited
at
our
house
should
always
have
put
me
through
the
same
inflammatory
process
under
similar
circumstances
yet
i
do
not
call
to
mind
that
i
was
ever
in
my
earlier
youth
the
subject
of
remark
in
our
social
family
circle
but
some
large
handed
person
took
some
such
ophthalmic
steps
to
patronize
me
all
this
while
the
strange
man
looked
at
nobody
but
me
and
looked
at
me
as
if
he
were
determined
to
have
a
shot
at
me
at
last
and
bring
me
down
but
he
said
nothing
after
offering
his
blue
blazes
observation
until
the
glasses
of
rum
and
water
were
brought
and
then
he
made
his
shot
and
a
most
extraordinary
shot
it
was
it
was
not
a
verbal
remark
but
a
proceeding
in
dumb
show
and
was
pointedly
addressed
to
me
he
stirred
his
rum
and
water
pointedly
at
me
and
he
tasted
his
rum
and
water
pointedly
at
me
and
he
stirred
it
and
he
tasted
it
not
with
a
spoon
that
was
brought
to
him
but
with
a
file
he
did
this
so
that
nobody
but
i
saw
the
file
and
when
he
had
done
it
he
wiped
the
file
and
put
it
in
a
breast
pocket
i
knew
it
to
be
joe
s
file
and
i
knew
that
he
knew
my
convict
the
moment
i
saw
the
instrument
i
sat
gazing
at
him
spell
bound
but
he
now
reclined
on
his
settle
taking
very
little
notice
of
me
and
talking
principally
about
turnips
there
was
a
delicious
sense
of
cleaning
up
and
making
a
quiet
pause
before
going
on
in
life
afresh
in
our
village
on
saturday
nights
which
stimulated
joe
to
dare
to
stay
out
half
an
hour
longer
on
saturdays
than
at
other
times
the
half
hour
and
the
rum
and
water
running
out
together
joe
got
up
to
go
and
took
me
by
the
hand
stop
half
a
moment
mr
gargery
said
the
strange
man
i
think
i
ve
got
a
bright
new
shilling
somewhere
in
my
pocket
and
if
i
have
the
boy
shall
have
it
he
looked
it
out
from
a
handful
of
small
change
folded
it
in
some
crumpled
paper
and
gave
it
to
me
yours
said
he
mind
your
own
i
thanked
him
staring
at
him
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
good
manners
and
holding
tight
to
joe
he
gave
joe
good
night
and
he
gave
mr
wopsle
good
night
who
went
out
with
us
and
he
gave
me
only
a
look
with
his
aiming
eye
no
not
a
look
for
he
shut
it
up
but
wonders
may
be
done
with
an
eye
by
hiding
it
on
the
way
home
if
i
had
been
in
a
humor
for
talking
the
talk
must
have
been
all
on
my
side
for
mr
wopsle
parted
from
us
at
the
door
of
the
jolly
bargemen
and
joe
went
all
the
way
home
with
his
mouth
wide
open
to
rinse
the
rum
out
with
as
much
air
as
possible
but
i
was
in
a
manner
stupefied
by
this
turning
up
of
my
old
misdeed
and
old
acquaintance
and
could
think
of
nothing
else
my
sister
was
not
in
a
very
bad
temper
when
we
presented
ourselves
in
the
kitchen
and
joe
was
encouraged
by
that
unusual
circumstance
to
tell
her
about
the
bright
shilling
a
bad
un
i
ll
be
bound
said
mrs
joe
triumphantly
or
he
wouldn
t
have
given
it
to
the
boy
let
s
look
at
it
i
took
it
out
of
the
paper
and
it
proved
to
be
a
good
one
but
what
s
this
said
mrs
joe
throwing
down
the
shilling
and
catching
up
the
paper
two
one
pound
notes
nothing
less
than
two
fat
sweltering
one
pound
notes
that
seemed
to
have
been
on
terms
of
the
warmest
intimacy
with
all
the
cattle
markets
in
the
county
joe
caught
up
his
hat
again
and
ran
with
them
to
the
jolly
bargemen
to
restore
them
to
their
owner
while
he
was
gone
i
sat
down
on
my
usual
stool
and
looked
vacantly
at
my
sister
feeling
pretty
sure
that
the
man
would
not
be
there
presently
joe
came
back
saying
that
the
man
was
gone
but
that
he
joe
had
left
word
at
the
three
jolly
bargemen
concerning
the
notes
then
my
sister
sealed
them
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
put
them
under
some
dried
rose
leaves
in
an
ornamental
teapot
on
the
top
of
a
press
in
the
state
parlor
there
they
remained
a
nightmare
to
me
many
and
many
a
night
and
day
i
had
sadly
broken
sleep
when
i
got
to
bed
through
thinking
of
the
strange
man
taking
aim
at
me
with
his
invisible
gun
and
of
the
guiltily
coarse
and
common
thing
it
was
to
be
on
secret
terms
of
conspiracy
with
convicts
a
feature
in
my
low
career
that
i
had
previously
forgotten
i
was
haunted
by
the
file
too
a
dread
possessed
me
that
when
i
least
expected
it
the
file
would
reappear
i
coaxed
myself
to
sleep
by
thinking
of
miss
havisham
s
next
wednesday
and
in
my
sleep
i
saw
the
file
coming
at
me
out
of
a
door
without
seeing
who
held
it
and
i
screamed
myself
awake
chapter
xi
at
the
appointed
time
i
returned
to
miss
havisham
s
and
my
hesitating
ring
at
the
gate
brought
out
estella
she
locked
it
after
admitting
me
as
she
had
done
before
and
again
preceded
me
into
the
dark
passage
where
her
candle
stood
she
took
no
notice
of
me
until
she
had
the
candle
in
her
hand
when
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
superciliously
saying
you
are
to
come
this
way
to
day
and
took
me
to
quite
another
part
of
the
house
the
passage
was
a
long
one
and
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
square
basement
of
the
manor
house
we
traversed
but
one
side
of
the
square
however
and
at
the
end
of
it
she
stopped
and
put
her
candle
down
and
opened
a
door
here
the
daylight
reappeared
and
i
found
myself
in
a
small
paved
courtyard
the
opposite
side
of
which
was
formed
by
a
detached
dwelling
house
that
looked
as
if
it
had
once
belonged
to
the
manager
or
head
clerk
of
the
extinct
brewery
there
was
a
clock
in
the
outer
wall
of
this
house
like
the
clock
in
miss
havisham
s
room
and
like
miss
havisham
s
watch
it
had
stopped
at
twenty
minutes
to
nine
we
went
in
at
the
door
which
stood
open
and
into
a
gloomy
room
with
a
low
ceiling
on
the
ground
floor
at
the
back
there
was
some
company
in
the
room
and
estella
said
to
me
as
she
joined
it
you
are
to
go
and
stand
there
boy
till
you
are
wanted
there
being
the
window
i
crossed
to
it
and
stood
there
in
a
very
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
looking
out
it
opened
to
the
ground
and
looked
into
a
most
miserable
corner
of
the
neglected
garden
upon
a
rank
ruin
of
cabbage
stalks
and
one
box
tree
that
had
been
clipped
round
long
ago
like
a
pudding
and
had
a
new
growth
at
the
top
of
it
out
of
shape
and
of
a
different
color
as
if
that
part
of
the
pudding
had
stuck
to
the
saucepan
and
got
burnt
this
was
my
homely
thought
as
i
contemplated
the
box
tree
there
had
been
some
light
snow
overnight
and
it
lay
nowhere
else
to
my
knowledge
but
it
had
not
quite
melted
from
the
cold
shadow
of
this
bit
of
garden
and
the
wind
caught
it
up
in
little
eddies
and
threw
it
at
the
window
as
if
it
pelted
me
for
coming
there
i
divined
that
my
coming
had
stopped
conversation
in
the
room
and
that
its
other
occupants
were
looking
at
me
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
room
except
the
shining
of
the
fire
in
the
window
glass
but
i
stiffened
in
all
my
joints
with
the
consciousness
that
i
was
under
close
inspection
there
were
three
ladies
in
the
room
and
one
gentleman
before
i
had
been
standing
at
the
window
five
minutes
they
somehow
conveyed
to
me
that
they
were
all
toadies
and
humbugs
but
that
each
of
them
pretended
not
to
know
that
the
others
were
toadies
and
humbugs
because
the
admission
that
he
or
she
did
know
it
would
have
made
him
or
her
out
to
be
a
toady
and
humbug
they
all
had
a
listless
and
dreary
air
of
waiting
somebody
s
pleasure
and
the
most
talkative
of
the
ladies
had
to
speak
quite
rigidly
to
repress
a
yawn
this
lady
whose
name
was
camilla
very
much
reminded
me
of
my
sister
with
the
difference
that
she
was
older
and
as
i
found
when
i
caught
sight
of
her
of
a
blunter
cast
of
features
indeed
when
i
knew
her
better
i
began
to
think
it
was
a
mercy
she
had
any
features
at
all
so
very
blank
and
high
was
the
dead
wall
of
her
face
poor
dear
soul
said
this
lady
with
an
abruptness
of
manner
quite
my
sister
s
nobody
s
enemy
but
his
own
it
would
be
much
more
commendable
to
be
somebody
else
s
enemy
said
the
gentleman
far
more
natural
cousin
raymond
observed
another
lady
we
are
to
love
our
neighbor
sarah
pocket
returned
cousin
raymond
if
a
man
is
not
his
own
neighbor
who
is
miss
pocket
laughed
and
camilla
laughed
and
said
checking
a
yawn
the
idea
but
i
thought
they
seemed
to
think
it
rather
a
good
idea
too
the
other
lady
who
had
not
spoken
yet
said
gravely
and
emphatically
very
true
poor
soul
camilla
presently
went
on
i
knew
they
had
all
been
looking
at
me
in
the
mean
time
he
is
so
very
strange
would
anyone
believe
that
when
tom
s
wife
died
he
actually
could
not
be
induced
to
see
the
importance
of
the
children
s
having
the
deepest
of
trimmings
to
their
mourning
good
lord
says
he
camilla
what
can
it
signify
so
long
as
the
poor
bereaved
little
things
are
in
black
so
like
matthew
the
idea
good
points
in
him
good
points
in
him
said
cousin
raymond
heaven
forbid
i
should
deny
good
points
in
him
but
he
never
had
and
he
never
will
have
any
sense
of
the
proprieties
you
know
i
was
obliged
said
camilla
i
was
obliged
to
be
firm
i
said
it
will
not
do
for
the
credit
of
the
family
i
told
him
that
without
deep
trimmings
the
family
was
disgraced
i
cried
about
it
from
breakfast
till
dinner
i
injured
my
digestion
and
at
last
he
flung
out
in
his
violent
way
and
said
with
a
d
then
do
as
you
like
thank
goodness
it
will
always
be
a
consolation
to
me
to
know
that
i
instantly
went
out
in
a
pouring
rain
and
bought
the
things
he
paid
for
them
did
he
not
asked
estella
it
s
not
the
question
my
dear
child
who
paid
for
them
returned
camilla
i
bought
them
and
i
shall
often
think
of
that
with
peace
when
i
wake
up
in
the
night
the
ringing
of
a
distant
bell
combined
with
the
echoing
of
some
cry
or
call
along
the
passage
by
which
i
had
come
interrupted
the
conversation
and
caused
estella
to
say
to
me
now
boy
on
my
turning
round
they
all
looked
at
me
with
the
utmost
contempt
and
as
i
went
out
i
heard
sarah
pocket
say
well
i
am
sure
what
next
and
camilla
add
with
indignation
was
there
ever
such
a
fancy
the
i
de
a
as
we
were
going
with
our
candle
along
the
dark
passage
estella
stopped
all
of
a
sudden
and
facing
round
said
in
her
taunting
manner
with
her
face
quite
close
to
mine
well
well
miss
i
answered
almost
falling
over
her
and
checking
myself
she
stood
looking
at
me
and
of
course
i
stood
looking
at
her
am
i
pretty
yes
i
think
you
are
very
pretty
am
i
insulting
not
so
much
so
as
you
were
last
time
said
i
not
so
much
so
no
she
fired
when
she
asked
the
last
question
and
she
slapped
my
face
with
such
force
as
she
had
when
i
answered
it
now
said
she
you
little
coarse
monster
what
do
you
think
of
me
now
i
shall
not
tell
you
because
you
are
going
to
tell
up
stairs
is
that
it
no
said
i
that
s
not
it
why
don
t
you
cry
again
you
little
wretch
because
i
ll
never
cry
for
you
again
said
i
which
was
i
suppose
as
false
a
declaration
as
ever
was
made
for
i
was
inwardly
crying
for
her
then
and
i
know
what
i
know
of
the
pain
she
cost
me
afterwards
we
went
on
our
way
up
stairs
after
this
episode
and
as
we
were
going
up
we
met
a
gentleman
groping
his
way
down
whom
have
we
here
asked
the
gentleman
stopping
and
looking
at
me
a
boy
said
estella
he
was
a
burly
man
of
an
exceedingly
dark
complexion
with
an
exceedingly
large
head
and
a
corresponding
large
hand
he
took
my
chin
in
his
large
hand
and
turned
up
my
face
to
have
a
look
at
me
by
the
light
of
the
candle
he
was
prematurely
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
and
had
bushy
black
eyebrows
that
wouldn
t
lie
down
but
stood
up
bristling
his
eyes
were
set
very
deep
in
his
head
and
were
disagreeably
sharp
and
suspicious
he
had
a
large
watch
chain
and
strong
black
dots
where
his
beard
and
whiskers
would
have
been
if
he
had
let
them
he
was
nothing
to
me
and
i
could
have
had
no
foresight
then
that
he
ever
would
be
anything
to
me
but
it
happened
that
i
had
this
opportunity
of
observing
him
well
boy
of
the
neighborhood
hey
said
he
yes
sir
said
i
how
do
you
come
here
miss
havisham
sent
for
me
sir
i
explained
well
behave
yourself
i
have
a
pretty
large
experience
of
boys
and
you
re
a
bad
set
of
fellows
now
mind
said
he
biting
the
side
of
his
great
forefinger
as
he
frowned
at
me
you
behave
yourself
with
those
words
he
released
me
which
i
was
glad
of
for
his
hand
smelt
of
scented
soap
and
went
his
way
down
stairs
i
wondered
whether
he
could
be
a
doctor
but
no
i
thought
he
couldn
t
be
a
doctor
or
he
would
have
a
quieter
and
more
persuasive
manner
there
was
not
much
time
to
consider
the
subject
for
we
were
soon
in
miss
havisham
s
room
where
she
and
everything
else
were
just
as
i
had
left
them
estella
left
me
standing
near
the
door
and
i
stood
there
until
miss
havisham
cast
her
eyes
upon
me
from
the
dressing
table
so
she
said
without
being
startled
or
surprised
the
days
have
worn
away
have
they
yes
ma
am
to
day
is
there
there
there
with
the
impatient
movement
of
her
fingers
i
don
t
want
to
know
are
you
ready
to
play
i
was
obliged
to
answer
in
some
confusion
i
don
t
think
i
am
ma
am
not
at
cards
again
she
demanded
with
a
searching
look
yes
ma
am
i
could
do
that
if
i
was
wanted
since
this
house
strikes
you
old
and
grave
boy
said
miss
havisham
impatiently
and
you
are
unwilling
to
play
are
you
willing
to
work
i
could
answer
this
inquiry
with
a
better
heart
than
i
had
been
able
to
find
for
the
other
question
and
i
said
i
was
quite
willing
then
go
into
that
opposite
room
said
she
pointing
at
the
door
behind
me
with
her
withered
hand
and
wait
there
till
i
come
i
crossed
the
staircase
landing
and
entered
the
room
she
indicated
from
that
room
too
the
daylight
was
completely
excluded
and
it
had
an
airless
smell
that
was
oppressive
a
fire
had
been
lately
kindled
in
the
damp
old
fashioned
grate
and
it
was
more
disposed
to
go
out
than
to
burn
up
and
the
reluctant
smoke
which
hung
in
the
room
seemed
colder
than
the
clearer
air
like
our
own
marsh
mist
certain
wintry
branches
of
candles
on
the
high
chimney
piece
faintly
lighted
the
chamber
or
it
would
be
more
expressive
to
say
faintly
troubled
its
darkness
it
was
spacious
and
i
dare
say
had
once
been
handsome
but
every
discernible
thing
in
it
was
covered
with
dust
and
mould
and
dropping
to
pieces
the
most
prominent
object
was
a
long
table
with
a
tablecloth
spread
on
it
as
if
a
feast
had
been
in
preparation
when
the
house
and
the
clocks
all
stopped
together
an
epergne
or
centre
piece
of
some
kind
was
in
the
middle
of
this
cloth
it
was
so
heavily
overhung
with
cobwebs
that
its
form
was
quite
undistinguishable
and
as
i
looked
along
the
yellow
expanse
out
of
which
i
remember
its
seeming
to
grow
like
a
black
fungus
i
saw
speckle
legged
spiders
with
blotchy
bodies
running
home
to
it
and
running
out
from
it
as
if
some
circumstances
of
the
greatest
public
importance
had
just
transpired
in
the
spider
community
i
heard
the
mice
too
rattling
behind
the
panels
as
if
the
same
occurrence
were
important
to
their
interests
but
the
black
beetles
took
no
notice
of
the
agitation
and
groped
about
the
hearth
in
a
ponderous
elderly
way
as
if
they
were
short
sighted
and
hard
of
hearing
and
not
on
terms
with
one
another
these
crawling
things
had
fascinated
my
attention
and
i
was
watching
them
from
a
distance
when
miss
havisham
laid
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
in
her
other
hand
she
had
a
crutch
headed
stick
on
which
she
leaned
and
she
looked
like
the
witch
of
the
place
this
said
she
pointing
to
the
long
table
with
her
stick
is
where
i
will
be
laid
when
i
am
dead
they
shall
come
and
look
at
me
here
with
some
vague
misgiving
that
she
might
get
upon
the
table
then
and
there
and
die
at
once
the
complete
realization
of
the
ghastly
waxwork
at
the
fair
i
shrank
under
her
touch
what
do
you
think
that
is
she
asked
me
again
pointing
with
her
stick
that
where
those
cobwebs
are
i
can
t
guess
what
it
is
ma
am
it
s
a
great
cake
a
bride
cake
mine
she
looked
all
round
the
room
in
a
glaring
manner
and
then
said
leaning
on
me
while
her
hand
twitched
my
shoulder
come
come
come
walk
me
walk
me
i
made
out
from
this
that
the
work
i
had
to
do
was
to
walk
miss
havisham
round
and
round
the
room
accordingly
i
started
at
once
and
she
leaned
upon
my
shoulder
and
we
went
away
at
a
pace
that
might
have
been
an
imitation
founded
on
my
first
impulse
under
that
roof
of
mr
pumblechook
s
chaise
cart
she
was
not
physically
strong
and
after
a
little
time
said
slower
still
we
went
at
an
impatient
fitful
speed
and
as
we
went
she
twitched
the
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
worked
her
mouth
and
led
me
to
believe
that
we
were
going
fast
because
her
thoughts
went
fast
after
a
while
she
said
call
estella
so
i
went
out
on
the
landing
and
roared
that
name
as
i
had
done
on
the
previous
occasion
when
her
light
appeared
i
returned
to
miss
havisham
and
we
started
away
again
round
and
round
the
room
if
only
estella
had
come
to
be
a
spectator
of
our
proceedings
i
should
have
felt
sufficiently
discontented
but
as
she
brought
with
her
the
three
ladies
and
the
gentleman
whom
i
had
seen
below
i
didn
t
know
what
to
do
in
my
politeness
i
would
have
stopped
but
miss
havisham
twitched
my
shoulder
and
we
posted
on
with
a
shame
faced
consciousness
on
my
part
that
they
would
think
it
was
all
my
doing
dear
miss
havisham
said
miss
sarah
pocket
how
well
you
look
i
do
not
returned
miss
havisham
i
am
yellow
skin
and
bone
camilla
brightened
when
miss
pocket
met
with
this
rebuff
and
she
murmured
as
she
plaintively
contemplated
miss
havisham
poor
dear
soul
certainly
not
to
be
expected
to
look
well
poor
thing
the
idea
and
how
are
you
said
miss
havisham
to
camilla
as
we
were
close
to
camilla
then
i
would
have
stopped
as
a
matter
of
course
only
miss
havisham
wouldn
t
stop
we
swept
on
and
i
felt
that
i
was
highly
obnoxious
to
camilla
thank
you
miss
havisham
she
returned
i
am
as
well
as
can
be
expected
why
what
s
the
matter
with
you
asked
miss
havisham
with
exceeding
sharpness
nothing
worth
mentioning
replied
camilla
i
don
t
wish
to
make
a
display
of
my
feelings
but
i
have
habitually
thought
of
you
more
in
the
night
than
i
am
quite
equal
to
then
don
t
think
of
me
retorted
miss
havisham
very
easily
said
remarked
camilla
amiably
repressing
a
sob
while
a
hitch
came
into
her
upper
lip
and
her
tears
overflowed
raymond
is
a
witness
what
ginger
and
sal
volatile
i
am
obliged
to
take
in
the
night
raymond
is
a
witness
what
nervous
jerkings
i
have
in
my
legs
chokings
and
nervous
jerkings
however
are
nothing
new
to
me
when
i
think
with
anxiety
of
those
i
love
if
i
could
be
less
affectionate
and
sensitive
i
should
have
a
better
digestion
and
an
iron
set
of
nerves
i
am
sure
i
wish
it
could
be
so
but
as
to
not
thinking
of
you
in
the
night
the
idea
here
a
burst
of
tears
the
raymond
referred
to
i
understood
to
be
the
gentleman
present
and
him
i
understood
to
be
mr
camilla
he
came
to
the
rescue
at
this
point
and
said
in
a
consolatory
and
complimentary
voice
camilla
my
dear
it
is
well
known
that
your
family
feelings
are
gradually
undermining
you
to
the
extent
of
making
one
of
your
legs
shorter
than
the
other
i
am
not
aware
observed
the
grave
lady
whose
voice
i
had
heard
but
once
that
to
think
of
any
person
is
to
make
a
great
claim
upon
that
person
my
dear
miss
sarah
pocket
whom
i
now
saw
to
be
a
little
dry
brown
corrugated
old
woman
with
a
small
face
that
might
have
been
made
of
walnut
shells
and
a
large
mouth
like
a
cat
s
without
the
whiskers
supported
this
position
by
saying
no
indeed
my
dear
hem
thinking
is
easy
enough
said
the
grave
lady
what
is
easier
you
know
assented
miss
sarah
pocket
oh
yes
yes
cried
camilla
whose
fermenting
feelings
appeared
to
rise
from
her
legs
to
her
bosom
it
s
all
very
true
it
s
a
weakness
to
be
so
affectionate
but
i
can
t
help
it
no
doubt
my
health
would
be
much
better
if
it
was
otherwise
still
i
wouldn
t
change
my
disposition
if
i
could
it
s
the
cause
of
much
suffering
but
it
s
a
consolation
to
know
i
posses
it
when
i
wake
up
in
the
night
here
another
burst
of
feeling
miss
havisham
and
i
had
never
stopped
all
this
time
but
kept
going
round
and
round
the
room
now
brushing
against
the
skirts
of
the
visitors
now
giving
them
the
whole
length
of
the
dismal
chamber
there
s
matthew
said
camilla
never
mixing
with
any
natural
ties
never
coming
here
to
see
how
miss
havisham
is
i
have
taken
to
the
sofa
with
my
staylace
cut
and
have
lain
there
hours
insensible
with
my
head
over
the
side
and
my
hair
all
down
and
my
feet
i
don
t
know
where
much
higher
than
your
head
my
love
said
mr
camilla
i
have
gone
off
into
that
state
hours
and
hours
on
account
of
matthew
s
strange
and
inexplicable
conduct
and
nobody
has
thanked
me
really
i
must
say
i
should
think
not
interposed
the
grave
lady
you
see
my
dear
added
miss
sarah
pocket
a
blandly
vicious
personage
the
question
to
put
to
yourself
is
who
did
you
expect
to
thank
you
my
love
without
expecting
any
thanks
or
anything
of
the
sort
resumed
camilla
i
have
remained
in
that
state
hours
and
hours
and
raymond
is
a
witness
of
the
extent
to
which
i
have
choked
and
what
the
total
inefficacy
of
ginger
has
been
and
i
have
been
heard
at
the
piano
forte
tuner
s
across
the
street
where
the
poor
mistaken
children
have
even
supposed
it
to
be
pigeons
cooing
at
a
distance
and
now
to
be
told
here
camilla
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
and
began
to
be
quite
chemical
as
to
the
formation
of
new
combinations
there
when
this
same
matthew
was
mentioned
miss
havisham
stopped
me
and
herself
and
stood
looking
at
the
speaker
this
change
had
a
great
influence
in
bringing
camilla
s
chemistry
to
a
sudden
end
matthew
will
come
and
see
me
at
last
said
miss
havisham
sternly
when
i
am
laid
on
that
table
that
will
be
his
place
there
striking
the
table
with
her
stick
at
my
head
and
yours
will
be
there
and
your
husband
s
there
and
sarah
pocket
s
there
and
georgiana
s
there
now
you
all
know
where
to
take
your
stations
when
you
come
to
feast
upon
me
and
now
go
at
the
mention
of
each
name
she
had
struck
the
table
with
her
stick
in
a
new
place
she
now
said
walk
me
walk
me
and
we
went
on
again
i
suppose
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
exclaimed
camilla
but
comply
and
depart
it
s
something
to
have
seen
the
object
of
one
s
love
and
duty
for
even
so
short
a
time
i
shall
think
of
it
with
a
melancholy
satisfaction
when
i
wake
up
in
the
night
i
wish
matthew
could
have
that
comfort
but
he
sets
it
at
defiance
i
am
determined
not
to
make
a
display
of
my
feelings
but
it
s
very
hard
to
be
told
one
wants
to
feast
on
one
s
relations
as
if
one
was
a
giant
and
to
be
told
to
go
the
bare
idea
mr
camilla
interposing
as
mrs
camilla
laid
her
hand
upon
her
heaving
bosom
that
lady
assumed
an
unnatural
fortitude
of
manner
which
i
supposed
to
be
expressive
of
an
intention
to
drop
and
choke
when
out
of
view
and
kissing
her
hand
to
miss
havisham
was
escorted
forth
sarah
pocket
and
georgiana
contended
who
should
remain
last
but
sarah
was
too
knowing
to
be
outdone
and
ambled
round
georgiana
with
that
artful
slipperiness
that
the
latter
was
obliged
to
take
precedence
sarah
pocket
then
made
her
separate
effect
of
departing
with
bless
you
miss
havisham
dear
and
with
a
smile
of
forgiving
pity
on
her
walnut
shell
countenance
for
the
weaknesses
of
the
rest
while
estella
was
away
lighting
them
down
miss
havisham
still
walked
with
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
but
more
and
more
slowly
at
last
she
stopped
before
the
fire
and
said
after
muttering
and
looking
at
it
some
seconds
this
is
my
birthday
pip
i
was
going
to
wish
her
many
happy
returns
when
she
lifted
her
stick
i
don
t
suffer
it
to
be
spoken
of
i
don
t
suffer
those
who
were
here
just
now
or
any
one
to
speak
of
it
they
come
here
on
the
day
but
they
dare
not
refer
to
it
of
course
i
made
no
further
effort
to
refer
to
it
on
this
day
of
the
year
long
before
you
were
born
this
heap
of
decay
stabbing
with
her
crutched
stick
at
the
pile
of
cobwebs
on
the
table
but
not
touching
it
was
brought
here
it
and
i
have
worn
away
together
the
mice
have
gnawed
at
it
and
sharper
teeth
than
teeth
of
mice
have
gnawed
at
me
she
held
the
head
of
her
stick
against
her
heart
as
she
stood
looking
at
the
table
she
in
her
once
white
dress
all
yellow
and
withered
the
once
white
cloth
all
yellow
and
withered
everything
around
in
a
state
to
crumble
under
a
touch
when
the
ruin
is
complete
said
she
with
a
ghastly
look
and
when
they
lay
me
dead
in
my
bride
s
dress
on
the
bride
s
table
which
shall
be
done
and
which
will
be
the
finished
curse
upon
him
so
much
the
better
if
it
is
done
on
this
day
she
stood
looking
at
the
table
as
if
she
stood
looking
at
her
own
figure
lying
there
i
remained
quiet
estella
returned
and
she
too
remained
quiet
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
continued
thus
for
a
long
time
in
the
heavy
air
of
the
room
and
the
heavy
darkness
that
brooded
in
its
remoter
corners
i
even
had
an
alarming
fancy
that
estella
and
i
might
presently
begin
to
decay
at
length
not
coming
out
of
her
distraught
state
by
degrees
but
in
an
instant
miss
havisham
said
let
me
see
you
two
play
cards
why
have
you
not
begun
with
that
we
returned
to
her
room
and
sat
down
as
before
i
was
beggared
as
before
and
again
as
before
miss
havisham
watched
us
all
the
time
directed
my
attention
to
estella
s
beauty
and
made
me
notice
it
the
more
by
trying
her
jewels
on
estella
s
breast
and
hair
estella
for
her
part
likewise
treated
me
as
before
except
that
she
did
not
condescend
to
speak
when
we
had
played
some
half
dozen
games
a
day
was
appointed
for
my
return
and
i
was
taken
down
into
the
yard
to
be
fed
in
the
former
dog
like
manner
there
too
i
was
again
left
to
wander
about
as
i
liked
it
is
not
much
to
the
purpose
whether
a
gate
in
that
garden
wall
which
i
had
scrambled
up
to
peep
over
on
the
last
occasion
was
on
that
last
occasion
open
or
shut
enough
that
i
saw
no
gate
then
and
that
i
saw
one
now
as
it
stood
open
and
as
i
knew
that
estella
had
let
the
visitors
out
for
she
had
returned
with
the
keys
in
her
hand
i
strolled
into
the
garden
and
strolled
all
over
it
it
was
quite
a
wilderness
and
there
were
old
melon
frames
and
cucumber
frames
in
it
which
seemed
in
their
decline
to
have
produced
a
spontaneous
growth
of
weak
attempts
at
pieces
of
old
hats
and
boots
with
now
and
then
a
weedy
offshoot
into
the
likeness
of
a
battered
saucepan
when
i
had
exhausted
the
garden
and
a
greenhouse
with
nothing
in
it
but
a
fallen
down
grape
vine
and
some
bottles
i
found
myself
in
the
dismal
corner
upon
which
i
had
looked
out
of
the
window
never
questioning
for
a
moment
that
the
house
was
now
empty
i
looked
in
at
another
window
and
found
myself
to
my
great
surprise
exchanging
a
broad
stare
with
a
pale
young
gentleman
with
red
eyelids
and
light
hair
this
pale
young
gentleman
quickly
disappeared
and
reappeared
beside
me
he
had
been
at
his
books
when
i
had
found
myself
staring
at
him
and
i
now
saw
that
he
was
inky
halloa
said
he
young
fellow
halloa
being
a
general
observation
which
i
had
usually
observed
to
be
best
answered
by
itself
i
said
halloa
politely
omitting
young
fellow
who
let
you
in
said
he
miss
estella
who
gave
you
leave
to
prowl
about
miss
estella
come
and
fight
said
the
pale
young
gentleman
what
could
i
do
but
follow
him
i
have
often
asked
myself
the
question
since
but
what
else
could
i
do
his
manner
was
so
final
and
i
was
so
astonished
that
i
followed
where
he
led
as
if
i
had
been
under
a
spell
stop
a
minute
though
he
said
wheeling
round
before
we
had
gone
many
paces
i
ought
to
give
you
a
reason
for
fighting
too
there
it
is
in
a
most
irritating
manner
he
instantly
slapped
his
hands
against
one
another
daintily
flung
one
of
his
legs
up
behind
him
pulled
my
hair
slapped
his
hands
again
dipped
his
head
and
butted
it
into
my
stomach
the
bull
like
proceeding
last
mentioned
besides
that
it
was
unquestionably
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
liberty
was
particularly
disagreeable
just
after
bread
and
meat
i
therefore
hit
out
at
him
and
was
going
to
hit
out
again
when
he
said
aha
would
you
and
began
dancing
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
manner
quite
unparalleled
within
my
limited
experience
laws
of
the
game
said
he
here
he
skipped
from
his
left
leg
on
to
his
right
regular
rules
here
he
skipped
from
his
right
leg
on
to
his
left
come
to
the
ground
and
go
through
the
preliminaries
here
he
dodged
backwards
and
forwards
and
did
all
sorts
of
things
while
i
looked
helplessly
at
him
i
was
secretly
afraid
of
him
when
i
saw
him
so
dexterous
but
i
felt
morally
and
physically
convinced
that
his
light
head
of
hair
could
have
had
no
business
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
and
that
i
had
a
right
to
consider
it
irrelevant
when
so
obtruded
on
my
attention
therefore
i
followed
him
without
a
word
to
a
retired
nook
of
the
garden
formed
by
the
junction
of
two
walls
and
screened
by
some
rubbish
on
his
asking
me
if
i
was
satisfied
with
the
ground
and
on
my
replying
yes
he
begged
my
leave
to
absent
himself
for
a
moment
and
quickly
returned
with
a
bottle
of
water
and
a
sponge
dipped
in
vinegar
available
for
both
he
said
placing
these
against
the
wall
and
then
fell
to
pulling
off
not
only
his
jacket
and
waistcoat
but
his
shirt
too
in
a
manner
at
once
light
hearted
business
like
and
bloodthirsty
although
he
did
not
look
very
healthy
having
pimples
on
his
face
and
a
breaking
out
at
his
mouth
these
dreadful
preparations
quite
appalled
me
i
judged
him
to
be
about
my
own
age
but
he
was
much
taller
and
he
had
a
way
of
spinning
himself
about
that
was
full
of
appearance
for
the
rest
he
was
a
young
gentleman
in
a
gray
suit
when
not
denuded
for
battle
with
his
elbows
knees
wrists
and
heels
considerably
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
him
as
to
development
my
heart
failed
me
when
i
saw
him
squaring
at
me
with
every
demonstration
of
mechanical
nicety
and
eyeing
my
anatomy
as
if
he
were
minutely
choosing
his
bone
i
never
have
been
so
surprised
in
my
life
as
i
was
when
i
let
out
the
first
blow
and
saw
him
lying
on
his
back
looking
up
at
me
with
a
bloody
nose
and
his
face
exceedingly
fore
shortened
but
he
was
on
his
feet
directly
and
after
sponging
himself
with
a
great
show
of
dexterity
began
squaring
again
the
second
greatest
surprise
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
was
seeing
him
on
his
back
again
looking
up
at
me
out
of
a
black
eye
his
spirit
inspired
me
with
great
respect
he
seemed
to
have
no
strength
and
he
never
once
hit
me
hard
and
he
was
always
knocked
down
but
he
would
be
up
again
in
a
moment
sponging
himself
or
drinking
out
of
the
water
bottle
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
seconding
himself
according
to
form
and
then
came
at
me
with
an
air
and
a
show
that
made
me
believe
he
really
was
going
to
do
for
me
at
last
he
got
heavily
bruised
for
i
am
sorry
to
record
that
the
more
i
hit
him
the
harder
i
hit
him
but
he
came
up
again
and
again
and
again
until
at
last
he
got
a
bad
fall
with
the
back
of
his
head
against
the
wall
even
after
that
crisis
in
our
affairs
he
got
up
and
turned
round
and
round
confusedly
a
few
times
not
knowing
where
i
was
but
finally
went
on
his
knees
to
his
sponge
and
threw
it
up
at
the
same
time
panting
out
that
means
you
have
won
he
seemed
so
brave
and
innocent
that
although
i
had
not
proposed
the
contest
i
felt
but
a
gloomy
satisfaction
in
my
victory
indeed
i
go
so
far
as
to
hope
that
i
regarded
myself
while
dressing
as
a
species
of
savage
young
wolf
or
other
wild
beast
however
i
got
dressed
darkly
wiping
my
sanguinary
face
at
intervals
and
i
said
can
i
help
you
and
he
said
no
thankee
and
i
said
good
afternoon
and
he
said
same
to
you
when
i
got
into
the
courtyard
i
found
estella
waiting
with
the
keys
but
she
neither
asked
me
where
i
had
been
nor
why
i
had
kept
her
waiting
and
there
was
a
bright
flush
upon
her
face
as
though
something
had
happened
to
delight
her
instead
of
going
straight
to
the
gate
too
she
stepped
back
into
the
passage
and
beckoned
me
come
here
you
may
kiss
me
if
you
like
i
kissed
her
cheek
as
she
turned
it
to
me
i
think
i
would
have
gone
through
a
great
deal
to
kiss
her
cheek
but
i
felt
that
the
kiss
was
given
to
the
coarse
common
boy
as
a
piece
of
money
might
have
been
and
that
it
was
worth
nothing
what
with
the
birthday
visitors
and
what
with
the
cards
and
what
with
the
fight
my
stay
had
lasted
so
long
that
when
i
neared
home
the
light
on
the
spit
of
sand
off
the
point
on
the
marshes
was
gleaming
against
a
black
night
sky
and
joe
s
furnace
was
flinging
a
path
of
fire
across
the
road
chapter
xii
my
mind
grew
very
uneasy
on
the
subject
of
the
pale
young
gentleman
the
more
i
thought
of
the
fight
and
recalled
the
pale
young
gentleman
on
his
back
in
various
stages
of
puffy
and
incrimsoned
countenance
the
more
certain
it
appeared
that
something
would
be
done
to
me
i
felt
that
the
pale
young
gentleman
s
blood
was
on
my
head
and
that
the
law
would
avenge
it
without
having
any
definite
idea
of
the
penalties
i
had
incurred
it
was
clear
to
me
that
village
boys
could
not
go
stalking
about
the
country
ravaging
the
houses
of
gentlefolks
and
pitching
into
the
studious
youth
of
england
without
laying
themselves
open
to
severe
punishment
for
some
days
i
even
kept
close
at
home
and
looked
out
at
the
kitchen
door
with
the
greatest
caution
and
trepidation
before
going
on
an
errand
lest
the
officers
of
the
county
jail
should
pounce
upon
me
the
pale
young
gentleman
s
nose
had
stained
my
trousers
and
i
tried
to
wash
out
that
evidence
of
my
guilt
in
the
dead
of
night
i
had
cut
my
knuckles
against
the
pale
young
gentleman
s
teeth
and
i
twisted
my
imagination
into
a
thousand
tangles
as
i
devised
incredible
ways
of
accounting
for
that
damnatory
circumstance
when
i
should
be
haled
before
the
judges
when
the
day
came
round
for
my
return
to
the
scene
of
the
deed
of
violence
my
terrors
reached
their
height
whether
myrmidons
of
justice
specially
sent
down
from
london
would
be
lying
in
ambush
behind
the
gate
whether
miss
havisham
preferring
to
take
personal
vengeance
for
an
outrage
done
to
her
house
might
rise
in
those
grave
clothes
of
hers
draw
a
pistol
and
shoot
me
dead
whether
suborned
boys
a
numerous
band
of
mercenaries
might
be
engaged
to
fall
upon
me
in
the
brewery
and
cuff
me
until
i
was
no
more
it
was
high
testimony
to
my
confidence
in
the
spirit
of
the
pale
young
gentleman
that
i
never
imagined
him
accessory
to
these
retaliations
they
always
came
into
my
mind
as
the
acts
of
injudicious
relatives
of
his
goaded
on
by
the
state
of
his
visage
and
an
indignant
sympathy
with
the
family
features
however
go
to
miss
havisham
s
i
must
and
go
i
did
and
behold
nothing
came
of
the
late
struggle
it
was
not
alluded
to
in
any
way
and
no
pale
young
gentleman
was
to
be
discovered
on
the
premises
i
found
the
same
gate
open
and
i
explored
the
garden
and
even
looked
in
at
the
windows
of
the
detached
house
but
my
view
was
suddenly
stopped
by
the
closed
shutters
within
and
all
was
lifeless
only
in
the
corner
where
the
combat
had
taken
place
could
i
detect
any
evidence
of
the
young
gentleman
s
existence
there
were
traces
of
his
gore
in
that
spot
and
i
covered
them
with
garden
mould
from
the
eye
of
man
on
the
broad
landing
between
miss
havisham
s
own
room
and
that
other
room
in
which
the
long
table
was
laid
out
i
saw
a
garden
chair
a
light
chair
on
wheels
that
you
pushed
from
behind
it
had
been
placed
there
since
my
last
visit
and
i
entered
that
same
day
on
a
regular
occupation
of
pushing
miss
havisham
in
this
chair
when
she
was
tired
of
walking
with
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
round
her
own
room
and
across
the
landing
and
round
the
other
room
over
and
over
and
over
again
we
would
make
these
journeys
and
sometimes
they
would
last
as
long
as
three
hours
at
a
stretch
i
insensibly
fall
into
a
general
mention
of
these
journeys
as
numerous
because
it
was
at
once
settled
that
i
should
return
every
alternate
day
at
noon
for
these
purposes
and
because
i
am
now
going
to
sum
up
a
period
of
at
least
eight
or
ten
months
as
we
began
to
be
more
used
to
one
another
miss
havisham
talked
more
to
me
and
asked
me
such
questions
as
what
had
i
learnt
and
what
was
i
going
to
be
i
told
her
i
was
going
to
be
apprenticed
to
joe
i
believed
and
i
enlarged
upon
my
knowing
nothing
and
wanting
to
know
everything
in
the
hope
that
she
might
offer
some
help
towards
that
desirable
end
but
she
did
not
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
to
prefer
my
being
ignorant
neither
did
she
ever
give
me
any
money
or
anything
but
my
daily
dinner
nor
ever
stipulate
that
i
should
be
paid
for
my
services
estella
was
always
about
and
always
let
me
in
and
out
but
never
told
me
i
might
kiss
her
again
sometimes
she
would
coldly
tolerate
me
sometimes
she
would
condescend
to
me
sometimes
she
would
be
quite
familiar
with
me
sometimes
she
would
tell
me
energetically
that
she
hated
me
miss
havisham
would
often
ask
me
in
a
whisper
or
when
we
were
alone
does
she
grow
prettier
and
prettier
pip
and
when
i
said
yes
for
indeed
she
did
would
seem
to
enjoy
it
greedily
also
when
we
played
at
cards
miss
havisham
would
look
on
with
a
miserly
relish
of
estella
s
moods
whatever
they
were
and
sometimes
when
her
moods
were
so
many
and
so
contradictory
of
one
another
that
i
was
puzzled
what
to
say
or
do
miss
havisham
would
embrace
her
with
lavish
fondness
murmuring
something
in
her
ear
that
sounded
like
break
their
hearts
my
pride
and
hope
break
their
hearts
and
have
no
mercy
there
was
a
song
joe
used
to
hum
fragments
of
at
the
forge
of
which
the
burden
was
old
clem
this
was
not
a
very
ceremonious
way
of
rendering
homage
to
a
patron
saint
but
i
believe
old
clem
stood
in
that
relation
towards
smiths
it
was
a
song
that
imitated
the
measure
of
beating
upon
iron
and
was
a
mere
lyrical
excuse
for
the
introduction
of
old
clem
s
respected
name
thus
you
were
to
hammer
boys
round
old
clem
with
a
thump
and
a
sound
old
clem
beat
it
out
beat
it
out
old
clem
with
a
clink
for
the
stout
old
clem
blow
the
fire
blow
the
fire
old
clem
roaring
dryer
soaring
higher
old
clem
one
day
soon
after
the
appearance
of
the
chair
miss
havisham
suddenly
saying
to
me
with
the
impatient
movement
of
her
fingers
there
there
there
sing
i
was
surprised
into
crooning
this
ditty
as
i
pushed
her
over
the
floor
it
happened
so
to
catch
her
fancy
that
she
took
it
up
in
a
low
brooding
voice
as
if
she
were
singing
in
her
sleep
after
that
it
became
customary
with
us
to
have
it
as
we
moved
about
and
estella
would
often
join
in
though
the
whole
strain
was
so
subdued
even
when
there
were
three
of
us
that
it
made
less
noise
in
the
grim
old
house
than
the
lightest
breath
of
wind
what
could
i
become
with
these
surroundings
how
could
my
character
fail
to
be
influenced
by
them
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
if
my
thoughts
were
dazed
as
my
eyes
were
when
i
came
out
into
the
natural
light
from
the
misty
yellow
rooms
perhaps
i
might
have
told
joe
about
the
pale
young
gentleman
if
i
had
not
previously
been
betrayed
into
those
enormous
inventions
to
which
i
had
confessed
under
the
circumstances
i
felt
that
joe
could
hardly
fail
to
discern
in
the
pale
young
gentleman
an
appropriate
passenger
to
be
put
into
the
black
velvet
coach
therefore
i
said
nothing
of
him
besides
that
shrinking
from
having
miss
havisham
and
estella
discussed
which
had
come
upon
me
in
the
beginning
grew
much
more
potent
as
time
went
on
i
reposed
complete
confidence
in
no
one
but
biddy
but
i
told
poor
biddy
everything
why
it
came
natural
to
me
to
do
so
and
why
biddy
had
a
deep
concern
in
everything
i
told
her
i
did
not
know
then
though
i
think
i
know
now
meanwhile
councils
went
on
in
the
kitchen
at
home
fraught
with
almost
insupportable
aggravation
to
my
exasperated
spirit
that
ass
pumblechook
used
often
to
come
over
of
a
night
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
my
prospects
with
my
sister
and
i
really
do
believe
to
this
hour
with
less
penitence
than
i
ought
to
feel
that
if
these
hands
could
have
taken
a
linchpin
out
of
his
chaise
cart
they
would
have
done
it
the
miserable
man
was
a
man
of
that
confined
stolidity
of
mind
that
he
could
not
discuss
my
prospects
without
having
me
before
him
as
it
were
to
operate
upon
and
he
would
drag
me
up
from
my
stool
usually
by
the
collar
where
i
was
quiet
in
a
corner
and
putting
me
before
the
fire
as
if
i
were
going
to
be
cooked
would
begin
by
saying
now
mum
here
is
this
boy
here
is
this
boy
which
you
brought
up
by
hand
hold
up
your
head
boy
and
be
forever
grateful
unto
them
which
so
did
do
now
mum
with
respections
to
this
boy
and
then
he
would
rumple
my
hair
the
wrong
way
which
from
my
earliest
remembrance
as
already
hinted
i
have
in
my
soul
denied
the
right
of
any
fellow
creature
to
do
and
would
hold
me
before
him
by
the
sleeve
a
spectacle
of
imbecility
only
to
be
equalled
by
himself
then
he
and
my
sister
would
pair
off
in
such
nonsensical
speculations
about
miss
havisham
and
about
what
she
would
do
with
me
and
for
me
that
i
used
to
want
quite
painfully
to
burst
into
spiteful
tears
fly
at
pumblechook
and
pummel
him
all
over
in
these
dialogues
my
sister
spoke
to
me
as
if
she
were
morally
wrenching
one
of
my
teeth
out
at
every
reference
while
pumblechook
himself
self
constituted
my
patron
would
sit
supervising
me
with
a
depreciatory
eye
like
the
architect
of
my
fortunes
who
thought
himself
engaged
on
a
very
unremunerative
job
in
these
discussions
joe
bore
no
part
but
he
was
often
talked
at
while
they
were
in
progress
by
reason
of
mrs
joe
s
perceiving
that
he
was
not
favorable
to
my
being
taken
from
the
forge
i
was
fully
old
enough
now
to
be
apprenticed
to
joe
and
when
joe
sat
with
the
poker
on
his
knees
thoughtfully
raking
out
the
ashes
between
the
lower
bars
my
sister
would
so
distinctly
construe
that
innocent
action
into
opposition
on
his
part
that
she
would
dive
at
him
take
the
poker
out
of
his
hands
shake
him
and
put
it
away
there
was
a
most
irritating
end
to
every
one
of
these
debates
all
in
a
moment
with
nothing
to
lead
up
to
it
my
sister
would
stop
herself
in
a
yawn
and
catching
sight
of
me
as
it
were
incidentally
would
swoop
upon
me
with
come
there
s
enough
of
you
you
get
along
to
bed
you
ve
given
trouble
enough
for
one
night
i
hope
as
if
i
had
besought
them
as
a
favor
to
bother
my
life
out
we
went
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
and
it
seemed
likely
that
we
should
continue
to
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
when
one
day
miss
havisham
stopped
short
as
she
and
i
were
walking
she
leaning
on
my
shoulder
and
said
with
some
displeasure
you
are
growing
tall
pip
i
thought
it
best
to
hint
through
the
medium
of
a
meditative
look
that
this
might
be
occasioned
by
circumstances
over
which
i
had
no
control
she
said
no
more
at
the
time
but
she
presently
stopped
and
looked
at
me
again
and
presently
again
and
after
that
looked
frowning
and
moody
on
the
next
day
of
my
attendance
when
our
usual
exercise
was
over
and
i
had
landed
her
at
her
dressing
table
she
stayed
me
with
a
movement
of
her
impatient
fingers
tell
me
the
name
again
of
that
blacksmith
of

meaning
the
master
you
were
to
be
apprenticed
to
yes
miss
havisham
you
had
better
be
apprenticed
at
once
would
gargery
come
here
with
you
and
bring
your
indentures

you
think
i
signified
that
i
had
no
doubt
he
would
take
it
as
an
honor
to
be
asked
then
let
him
come
at
any
particular
time
miss
havisham
there
there
i
know
nothing
about
times
let
him
come
soon
and
come
along
with
you
when
i
got
home
at
night
and
delivered
this
message
for
joe
my
sister
went
on
the
rampage
in
a
more
alarming
degree
than
at
any
previous
period
she
asked
me
and
joe
whether
we
supposed
she
was
door
mats
under
our
feet
and
how
we
dared
to
use
her
so
and
what
company
we
graciously
thought
she
was
fit
for
when
she
had
exhausted
a
torrent
of
such
inquiries
she
threw
a
candlestick
at
joe
burst
into
a
loud
sobbing
got
out
the
dustpan
which
was
always
a
very
bad
sign
put
on
her
coarse
apron
and
began
cleaning
up
to
a
terrible
extent
not
satisfied
with
a
dry
cleaning
she
took
to
a
pail
and
scrubbing
brush
and
cleaned
us
out
of
house
and
home
so
that
we
stood
shivering
in
the
back
yard
it
was
ten
o
clock
at
night
before
we
ventured
to
creep
in
again
and
then
she
asked
joe
why
he
hadn
t
married
a
negress
slave
at
once
joe
offered
no
answer
poor
fellow
but
stood
feeling
his
whisker
and
looking
dejectedly
at
me
as
if
he
thought
it
really
might
have
been
a
better
speculation
chapter
xiii
it
was
a
trial
to
my
feelings
on
the
next
day
but
one
to
see
joe
arraying
himself
in
his
sunday
clothes
to
accompany
me
to
miss
havisham
s
however
as
he
thought
his
court
suit
necessary
to
the
occasion
it
was
not
for
me
to
tell
him
that
he
looked
far
better
in
his
working
dress
the
rather
because
i
knew
he
made
himself
so
dreadfully
uncomfortable
entirely
on
my
account
and
that
it
was
for
me
he
pulled
up
his
shirt
collar
so
very
high
behind
that
it
made
the
hair
on
the
crown
of
his
head
stand
up
like
a
tuft
of
feathers
at
breakfast
time
my
sister
declared
her
intention
of
going
to
town
with
us
and
being
left
at
uncle
pumblechook
s
and
called
for
when
we
had
done
with
our
fine
ladies
a
way
of
putting
the
case
from
which
joe
appeared
inclined
to
augur
the
worst
the
forge
was
shut
up
for
the
day
and
joe
inscribed
in
chalk
upon
the
door
as
it
was
his
custom
to
do
on
the
very
rare
occasions
when
he
was
not
at
work
the
monosyllable
hout
accompanied
by
a
sketch
of
an
arrow
supposed
to
be
flying
in
the
direction
he
had
taken
we
walked
to
town
my
sister
leading
the
way
in
a
very
large
beaver
bonnet
and
carrying
a
basket
like
the
great
seal
of
england
in
plaited
straw
a
pair
of
pattens
a
spare
shawl
and
an
umbrella
though
it
was
a
fine
bright
day
i
am
not
quite
clear
whether
these
articles
were
carried
penitentially
or
ostentatiously
but
i
rather
think
they
were
displayed
as
articles
of
property
much
as
cleopatra
or
any
other
sovereign
lady
on
the
rampage
might
exhibit
her
wealth
in
a
pageant
or
procession
when
we
came
to
pumblechook
s
my
sister
bounced
in
and
left
us
as
it
was
almost
noon
joe
and
i
held
straight
on
to
miss
havisham
s
house
estella
opened
the
gate
as
usual
and
the
moment
she
appeared
joe
took
his
hat
off
and
stood
weighing
it
by
the
brim
in
both
his
hands
as
if
he
had
some
urgent
reason
in
his
mind
for
being
particular
to
half
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
estella
took
no
notice
of
either
of
us
but
led
us
the
way
that
i
knew
so
well
i
followed
next
to
her
and
joe
came
last
when
i
looked
back
at
joe
in
the
long
passage
he
was
still
weighing
his
hat
with
the
greatest
care
and
was
coming
after
us
in
long
strides
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
estella
told
me
we
were
both
to
go
in
so
i
took
joe
by
the
coat
cuff
and
conducted
him
into
miss
havisham
s
presence
she
was
seated
at
her
dressing
table
and
looked
round
at
us
immediately
oh
said
she
to
joe
you
are
the
husband
of
the
sister
of
this
boy
i
could
hardly
have
imagined
dear
old
joe
looking
so
unlike
himself
or
so
like
some
extraordinary
bird
standing
as
he
did
speechless
with
his
tuft
of
feathers
ruffled
and
his
mouth
open
as
if
he
wanted
a
worm
you
are
the
husband
repeated
miss
havisham
of
the
sister
of
this
boy
it
was
very
aggravating
but
throughout
the
interview
joe
persisted
in
addressing
me
instead
of
miss
havisham
which
i
meantersay
pip
joe
now
observed
in
a
manner
that
was
at
once
expressive
of
forcible
argumentation
strict
confidence
and
great
politeness
as
i
hup
and
married
your
sister
and
i
were
at
the
time
what
you
might
call
if
you
was
anyways
inclined
a
single
man
well
said
miss
havisham
and
you
have
reared
the
boy
with
the
intention
of
taking
him
for
your
apprentice
is
that
so
mr
gargery
you
know
pip
replied
joe
as
you
and
me
were
ever
friends
and
it
were
looked
for
ard
to
betwixt
us
as
being
calc
lated
to
lead
to
larks
not
but
what
pip
if
you
had
ever
made
objections
to
the
business
such
as
its
being
open
to
black
and
sut
or
such
like
not
but
what
they
would
have
been
attended
to
don
t
you
see
has
the
boy
said
miss
havisham
ever
made
any
objection
does
he
like
the
trade
which
it
is
well
beknown
to
yourself
pip
returned
joe
strengthening
his
former
mixture
of
argumentation
confidence
and
politeness
that
it
were
the
wish
of
your
own
hart
i
saw
the
idea
suddenly
break
upon
him
that
he
would
adapt
his
epitaph
to
the
occasion
before
he
went
on
to
say
and
there
weren
t
no
objection
on
your
part
and
pip
it
were
the
great
wish
of
your
hart
it
was
quite
in
vain
for
me
to
endeavor
to
make
him
sensible
that
he
ought
to
speak
to
miss
havisham
the
more
i
made
faces
and
gestures
to
him
to
do
it
the
more
confidential
argumentative
and
polite
he
persisted
in
being
to
me
have
you
brought
his
indentures
with
you
asked
miss
havisham
well
pip
you
know
replied
joe
as
if
that
were
a
little
unreasonable
you
yourself
see
me
put
em
in
my
at
and
therefore
you
know
as
they
are
here
with
which
he
took
them
out
and
gave
them
not
to
miss
havisham
but
to
me
i
am
afraid
i
was
ashamed
of
the
dear
good
fellow
i
know
i
was
ashamed
of
him
when
i
saw
that
estella
stood
at
the
back
of
miss
havisham
s
chair
and
that
her
eyes
laughed
mischievously
i
took
the
indentures
out
of
his
hand
and
gave
them
to
miss
havisham
you
expected
said
miss
havisham
as
she
looked
them
over
no
premium
with
the
boy
joe
i
remonstrated
for
he
made
no
reply
at
all
why
don
t
you
answer
pip
returned
joe
cutting
me
short
as
if
he
were
hurt
which
i
meantersay
that
were
not
a
question
requiring
a
answer
betwixt
yourself
and
me
and
which
you
know
the
answer
to
be
full
well
no
you
know
it
to
be
no
pip
and
wherefore
should
i
say
it
miss
havisham
glanced
at
him
as
if
she
understood
what
he
really
was
better
than
i
had
thought
possible
seeing
what
he
was
there
and
took
up
a
little
bag
from
the
table
beside
her
pip
has
earned
a
premium
here
she
said
and
here
it
is
there
are
five
and
twenty
guineas
in
this
bag
give
it
to
your
master
pip
as
if
he
were
absolutely
out
of
his
mind
with
the
wonder
awakened
in
him
by
her
strange
figure
and
the
strange
room
joe
even
at
this
pass
persisted
in
addressing
me
this
is
wery
liberal
on
your
part
pip
said
joe
and
it
is
as
such
received
and
grateful
welcome
though
never
looked
for
far
nor
near
nor
nowheres
and
now
old
chap
said
joe
conveying
to
me
a
sensation
first
of
burning
and
then
of
freezing
for
i
felt
as
if
that
familiar
expression
were
applied
to
miss
havisham
and
now
old
chap
may
we
do
our
duty
may
you
and
me
do
our
duty
both
on
us
by
one
and
another
and
by
them
which
your
liberal
present
have
conweyed
to
be
for
the
satisfaction
of
mind
of
them
as
never
here
joe
showed
that
he
felt
he
had
fallen
into
frightful
difficulties
until
he
triumphantly
rescued
himself
with
the
words
and
from
myself
far
be
it
these
words
had
such
a
round
and
convincing
sound
for
him
that
he
said
them
twice
good
by
pip
said
miss
havisham
let
them
out
estella
am
i
to
come
again
miss
havisham
i
asked
no
gargery
is
your
master
now
gargery
one
word
thus
calling
him
back
as
i
went
out
of
the
door
i
heard
her
say
to
joe
in
a
distinct
emphatic
voice
the
boy
has
been
a
good
boy
here
and
that
is
his
reward
of
course
as
an
honest
man
you
will
expect
no
other
and
no
more
how
joe
got
out
of
the
room
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine
but
i
know
that
when
he
did
get
out
he
was
steadily
proceeding
up
stairs
instead
of
coming
down
and
was
deaf
to
all
remonstrances
until
i
went
after
him
and
laid
hold
of
him
in
another
minute
we
were
outside
the
gate
and
it
was
locked
and
estella
was
gone
when
we
stood
in
the
daylight
alone
again
joe
backed
up
against
a
wall
and
said
to
me
astonishing
and
there
he
remained
so
long
saying
astonishing
at
intervals
so
often
that
i
began
to
think
his
senses
were
never
coming
back
at
length
he
prolonged
his
remark
into
pip
i
do
assure
you
this
is
as
ton
ishing
and
so
by
degrees
became
conversational
and
able
to
walk
away
i
have
reason
to
think
that
joe
s
intellects
were
brightened
by
the
encounter
they
had
passed
through
and
that
on
our
way
to
pumblechook
s
he
invented
a
subtle
and
deep
design
my
reason
is
to
be
found
in
what
took
place
in
mr
pumblechook
s
parlor
where
on
our
presenting
ourselves
my
sister
sat
in
conference
with
that
detested
seedsman
well
cried
my
sister
addressing
us
both
at
once
and
what
s
happened
to
you
i
wonder
you
condescend
to
come
back
to
such
poor
society
as
this
i
am
sure
i
do
miss
havisham
said
joe
with
a
fixed
look
at
me
like
an
effort
of
remembrance
made
it
wery
partick
ler
that
we
should
give
her
were
it
compliments
or
respects
pip
compliments
i
said
which
that
were
my
own
belief
answered
joe
her
compliments
to
mrs
j
gargery
much
good
they
ll
do
me
observed
my
sister
but
rather
gratified
too
and
wishing
pursued
joe
with
another
fixed
look
at
me
like
another
effort
of
remembrance
that
the
state
of
miss
havisham
s
elth
were
sitch
as
would
have
allowed
were
it
pip
of
her
having
the
pleasure
i
added
of
ladies
company
said
joe
and
drew
a
long
breath
well
cried
my
sister
with
a
mollified
glance
at
mr
pumblechook
she
might
have
had
the
politeness
to
send
that
message
at
first
but
it
s
better
late
than
never
and
what
did
she
give
young
rantipole
here
she
giv
him
said
joe
nothing
mrs
joe
was
going
to
break
out
but
joe
went
on
what
she
giv
said
joe
she
giv
to
his
friends
and
by
his
friends
were
her
explanation
i
mean
into
the
hands
of
his
sister
mrs
j
gargery
them
were
her
words
mrs
j
gargery
she
mayn
t
have
know
d
added
joe
with
an
appearance
of
reflection
whether
it
were
joe
or
jorge
my
sister
looked
at
pumblechook
who
smoothed
the
elbows
of
his
wooden
arm
chair
and
nodded
at
her
and
at
the
fire
as
if
he
had
known
all
about
it
beforehand
and
how
much
have
you
got
asked
my
sister
laughing
positively
laughing
what
would
present
company
say
to
ten
pound
demanded
joe
they
d
say
returned
my
sister
curtly
pretty
well
not
too
much
but
pretty
well
it
s
more
than
that
then
said
joe
that
fearful
impostor
pumblechook
immediately
nodded
and
said
as
he
rubbed
the
arms
of
his
chair
it
s
more
than
that
mum
why
you
don
t
mean
to
say
began
my
sister
yes
i
do
mum
said
pumblechook
but
wait
a
bit
go
on
joseph
good
in
you
go
on
what
would
present
company
say
proceeded
joe
to
twenty
pound
handsome
would
be
the
word
returned
my
sister
well
then
said
joe
it
s
more
than
twenty
pound
that
abject
hypocrite
pumblechook
nodded
again
and
said
with
a
patronizing
laugh
it
s
more
than
that
mum
good
again
follow
her
up
joseph
then
to
make
an
end
of
it
said
joe
delightedly
handing
the
bag
to
my
sister
it
s
five
and
twenty
pound
it
s
five
and
twenty
pound
mum
echoed
that
basest
of
swindlers
pumblechook
rising
to
shake
hands
with
her
and
it
s
no
more
than
your
merits
as
i
said
when
my
opinion
was
asked
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
the
money
if
the
villain
had
stopped
here
his
case
would
have
been
sufficiently
awful
but
he
blackened
his
guilt
by
proceeding
to
take
me
into
custody
with
a
right
of
patronage
that
left
all
his
former
criminality
far
behind
now
you
see
joseph
and
wife
said
pumblechook
as
he
took
me
by
the
arm
above
the
elbow
i
am
one
of
them
that
always
go
right
through
with
what
they
ve
begun
this
boy
must
be
bound
out
of
hand
that
s
my
way
bound
out
of
hand
goodness
knows
uncle
pumblechook
said
my
sister
grasping
the
money
we
re
deeply
beholden
to
you
never
mind
me
mum
returned
that
diabolical
cornchandler
a
pleasure
s
a
pleasure
all
the
world
over
but
this
boy
you
know
we
must
have
him
bound
i
said
i
d
see
to
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
justices
were
sitting
in
the
town
hall
near
at
hand
and
we
at
once
went
over
to
have
me
bound
apprentice
to
joe
in
the
magisterial
presence
i
say
we
went
over
but
i
was
pushed
over
by
pumblechook
exactly
as
if
i
had
that
moment
picked
a
pocket
or
fired
a
rick
indeed
it
was
the
general
impression
in
court
that
i
had
been
taken
red
handed
for
as
pumblechook
shoved
me
before
him
through
the
crowd
i
heard
some
people
say
what
s
he
done
and
others
he
s
a
young
un
too
but
looks
bad
don
t
he
one
person
of
mild
and
benevolent
aspect
even
gave
me
a
tract
ornamented
with
a
woodcut
of
a
malevolent
young
man
fitted
up
with
a
perfect
sausage
shop
of
fetters
and
entitled
to
be
read
in
my
cell
the
hall
was
a
queer
place
i
thought
with
higher
pews
in
it
than
a
church
and
with
people
hanging
over
the
pews
looking
on
and
with
mighty
justices
one
with
a
powdered
head
leaning
back
in
chairs
with
folded
arms
or
taking
snuff
or
going
to
sleep
or
writing
or
reading
the
newspapers
and
with
some
shining
black
portraits
on
the
walls
which
my
unartistic
eye
regarded
as
a
composition
of
hardbake
and
sticking
plaster
here
in
a
corner
my
indentures
were
duly
signed
and
attested
and
i
was
bound
mr
pumblechook
holding
me
all
the
while
as
if
we
had
looked
in
on
our
way
to
the
scaffold
to
have
those
little
preliminaries
disposed
of
when
we
had
come
out
again
and
had
got
rid
of
the
boys
who
had
been
put
into
great
spirits
by
the
expectation
of
seeing
me
publicly
tortured
and
who
were
much
disappointed
to
find
that
my
friends
were
merely
rallying
round
me
we
went
back
to
pumblechook
s
and
there
my
sister
became
so
excited
by
the
twenty
five
guineas
that
nothing
would
serve
her
but
we
must
have
a
dinner
out
of
that
windfall
at
the
blue
boar
and
that
pumblechook
must
go
over
in
his
chaise
cart
and
bring
the
hubbles
and
mr
wopsle
it
was
agreed
to
be
done
and
a
most
melancholy
day
i
passed
for
it
inscrutably
appeared
to
stand
to
reason
in
the
minds
of
the
whole
company
that
i
was
an
excrescence
on
the
entertainment
and
to
make
it
worse
they
all
asked
me
from
time
to
time
in
short
whenever
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
why
i
didn
t
enjoy
myself
and
what
could
i
possibly
do
then
but
say
i
was
enjoying
myself
when
i
wasn
t
however
they
were
grown
up
and
had
their
own
way
and
they
made
the
most
of
it
that
swindling
pumblechook
exalted
into
the
beneficent
contriver
of
the
whole
occasion
actually
took
the
top
of
the
table
and
when
he
addressed
them
on
the
subject
of
my
being
bound
and
had
fiendishly
congratulated
them
on
my
being
liable
to
imprisonment
if
i
played
at
cards
drank
strong
liquors
kept
late
hours
or
bad
company
or
indulged
in
other
vagaries
which
the
form
of
my
indentures
appeared
to
contemplate
as
next
to
inevitable
he
placed
me
standing
on
a
chair
beside
him
to
illustrate
his
remarks
my
only
other
remembrances
of
the
great
festival
are
that
they
wouldn
t
let
me
go
to
sleep
but
whenever
they
saw
me
dropping
off
woke
me
up
and
told
me
to
enjoy
myself
that
rather
late
in
the
evening
mr
wopsle
gave
us
collins
s
ode
and
threw
his
bloodstained
sword
in
thunder
down
with
such
effect
that
a
waiter
came
in
and
said
the
commercials
underneath
sent
up
their
compliments
and
it
wasn
t
the
tumblers
arms
that
they
were
all
in
excellent
spirits
on
the
road
home
and
sang
o
lady
fair
mr
wopsle
taking
the
bass
and
asserting
with
a
tremendously
strong
voice
in
reply
to
the
inquisitive
bore
who
leads
that
piece
of
music
in
a
most
impertinent
manner
by
wanting
to
know
all
about
everybody
s
private
affairs
that
he
was
the
man
with
his
white
locks
flowing
and
that
he
was
upon
the
whole
the
weakest
pilgrim
going
finally
i
remember
that
when
i
got
into
my
little
bedroom
i
was
truly
wretched
and
had
a
strong
conviction
on
me
that
i
should
never
like
joe
s
trade
i
had
liked
it
once
but
once
was
not
now
chapter
xiv
it
is
a
most
miserable
thing
to
feel
ashamed
of
home
there
may
be
black
ingratitude
in
the
thing
and
the
punishment
may
be
retributive
and
well
deserved
but
that
it
is
a
miserable
thing
i
can
testify
home
had
never
been
a
very
pleasant
place
to
me
because
of
my
sister
s
temper
but
joe
had
sanctified
it
and
i
had
believed
in
it
i
had
believed
in
the
best
parlor
as
a
most
elegant
saloon
i
had
believed
in
the
front
door
as
a
mysterious
portal
of
the
temple
of
state
whose
solemn
opening
was
attended
with
a
sacrifice
of
roast
fowls
i
had
believed
in
the
kitchen
as
a
chaste
though
not
magnificent
apartment
i
had
believed
in
the
forge
as
the
glowing
road
to
manhood
and
independence
within
a
single
year
all
this
was
changed
now
it
was
all
coarse
and
common
and
i
would
not
have
had
miss
havisham
and
estella
see
it
on
any
account
how
much
of
my
ungracious
condition
of
mind
may
have
been
my
own
fault
how
much
miss
havisham
s
how
much
my
sister
s
is
now
of
no
moment
to
me
or
to
any
one
the
change
was
made
in
me
the
thing
was
done
well
or
ill
done
excusably
or
inexcusably
it
was
done
once
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
when
i
should
at
last
roll
up
my
shirt
sleeves
and
go
into
the
forge
joe
s
prentice
i
should
be
distinguished
and
happy
now
the
reality
was
in
my
hold
i
only
felt
that
i
was
dusty
with
the
dust
of
small
coal
and
that
i
had
a
weight
upon
my
daily
remembrance
to
which
the
anvil
was
a
feather
there
have
been
occasions
in
my
later
life
i
suppose
as
in
most
lives
when
i
have
felt
for
a
time
as
if
a
thick
curtain
had
fallen
on
all
its
interest
and
romance
to
shut
me
out
from
anything
save
dull
endurance
any
more
never
has
that
curtain
dropped
so
heavy
and
blank
as
when
my
way
in
life
lay
stretched
out
straight
before
me
through
the
newly
entered
road
of
apprenticeship
to
joe
i
remember
that
at
a
later
period
of
my
time
i
used
to
stand
about
the
churchyard
on
sunday
evenings
when
night
was
falling
comparing
my
own
perspective
with
the
windy
marsh
view
and
making
out
some
likeness
between
them
by
thinking
how
flat
and
low
both
were
and
how
on
both
there
came
an
unknown
way
and
a
dark
mist
and
then
the
sea
i
was
quite
as
dejected
on
the
first
working
day
of
my
apprenticeship
as
in
that
after
time
but
i
am
glad
to
know
that
i
never
breathed
a
murmur
to
joe
while
my
indentures
lasted
it
is
about
the
only
thing
i
am
glad
to
know
of
myself
in
that
connection
for
though
it
includes
what
i
proceed
to
add
all
the
merit
of
what
i
proceed
to
add
was
joe
s
it
was
not
because
i
was
faithful
but
because
joe
was
faithful
that
i
never
ran
away
and
went
for
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
it
was
not
because
i
had
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of
industry
but
because
joe
had
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of
industry
that
i
worked
with
tolerable
zeal
against
the
grain
it
is
not
possible
to
know
how
far
the
influence
of
any
amiable
honest
hearted
duty
doing
man
flies
out
into
the
world
but
it
is
very
possible
to
know
how
it
has
touched
one
s
self
in
going
by
and
i
know
right
well
that
any
good
that
intermixed
itself
with
my
apprenticeship
came
of
plain
contented
joe
and
not
of
restlessly
aspiring
discontented
me
what
i
wanted
who
can
say
how
can
i
say
when
i
never
knew
what
i
dreaded
was
that
in
some
unlucky
hour
i
being
at
my
grimiest
and
commonest
should
lift
up
my
eyes
and
see
estella
looking
in
at
one
of
the
wooden
windows
of
the
forge
i
was
haunted
by
the
fear
that
she
would
sooner
or
later
find
me
out
with
a
black
face
and
hands
doing
the
coarsest
part
of
my
work
and
would
exult
over
me
and
despise
me
often
after
dark
when
i
was
pulling
the
bellows
for
joe
and
we
were
singing
old
clem
and
when
the
thought
how
we
used
to
sing
it
at
miss
havisham
s
would
seem
to
show
me
estella
s
face
in
the
fire
with
her
pretty
hair
fluttering
in
the
wind
and
her
eyes
scorning
me
often
at
such
a
time
i
would
look
towards
those
panels
of
black
night
in
the
wall
which
the
wooden
windows
then
were
and
would
fancy
that
i
saw
her
just
drawing
her
face
away
and
would
believe
that
she
had
come
at
last
after
that
when
we
went
in
to
supper
the
place
and
the
meal
would
have
a
more
homely
look
than
ever
and
i
would
feel
more
ashamed
of
home
than
ever
in
my
own
ungracious
breast
chapter
xv
as
i
was
getting
too
big
for
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
s
room
my
education
under
that
preposterous
female
terminated
not
however
until
biddy
had
imparted
to
me
everything
she
knew
from
the
little
catalogue
of
prices
to
a
comic
song
she
had
once
bought
for
a
half
penny
although
the
only
coherent
part
of
the
latter
piece
of
literature
were
the
opening
lines
when
i
went
to
lunnon
town
sirs
too
rul
loo
rul
too
rul
loo
rul
wasn
t
i
done
very
brown
sirs
too
rul
loo
rul
too
rul
loo
rul
still
in
my
desire
to
be
wiser
i
got
this
composition
by
heart
with
the
utmost
gravity
nor
do
i
recollect
that
i
questioned
its
merit
except
that
i
thought
as
i
still
do
the
amount
of
too
rul
somewhat
in
excess
of
the
poetry
in
my
hunger
for
information
i
made
proposals
to
mr
wopsle
to
bestow
some
intellectual
crumbs
upon
me
with
which
he
kindly
complied
as
it
turned
out
however
that
he
only
wanted
me
for
a
dramatic
lay
figure
to
be
contradicted
and
embraced
and
wept
over
and
bullied
and
clutched
and
stabbed
and
knocked
about
in
a
variety
of
ways
i
soon
declined
that
course
of
instruction
though
not
until
mr
wopsle
in
his
poetic
fury
had
severely
mauled
me
whatever
i
acquired
i
tried
to
impart
to
joe
this
statement
sounds
so
well
that
i
cannot
in
my
conscience
let
it
pass
unexplained
i
wanted
to
make
joe
less
ignorant
and
common
that
he
might
be
worthier
of
my
society
and
less
open
to
estella
s
reproach
the
old
battery
out
on
the
marshes
was
our
place
of
study
and
a
broken
slate
and
a
short
piece
of
slate
pencil
were
our
educational
implements
to
which
joe
always
added
a
pipe
of
tobacco
i
never
knew
joe
to
remember
anything
from
one
sunday
to
another
or
to
acquire
under
my
tuition
any
piece
of
information
whatever
yet
he
would
smoke
his
pipe
at
the
battery
with
a
far
more
sagacious
air
than
anywhere
else
even
with
a
learned
air
as
if
he
considered
himself
to
be
advancing
immensely
dear
fellow
i
hope
he
did
it
was
pleasant
and
quiet
out
there
with
the
sails
on
the
river
passing
beyond
the
earthwork
and
sometimes
when
the
tide
was
low
looking
as
if
they
belonged
to
sunken
ships
that
were
still
sailing
on
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
whenever
i
watched
the
vessels
standing
out
to
sea
with
their
white
sails
spread
i
somehow
thought
of
miss
havisham
and
estella
and
whenever
the
light
struck
aslant
afar
off
upon
a
cloud
or
sail
or
green
hillside
or
water
line
it
was
just
the
same
miss
havisham
and
estella
and
the
strange
house
and
the
strange
life
appeared
to
have
something
to
do
with
everything
that
was
picturesque
one
sunday
when
joe
greatly
enjoying
his
pipe
had
so
plumed
himself
on
being
most
awful
dull
that
i
had
given
him
up
for
the
day
i
lay
on
the
earthwork
for
some
time
with
my
chin
on
my
hand
descrying
traces
of
miss
havisham
and
estella
all
over
the
prospect
in
the
sky
and
in
the
water
until
at
last
i
resolved
to
mention
a
thought
concerning
them
that
had
been
much
in
my
head
joe
said
i
don
t
you
think
i
ought
to
make
miss
havisham
a
visit
well
pip
returned
joe
slowly
considering
what
for
what
for
joe
what
is
any
visit
made
for
there
is
some
wisits
p
r
aps
said
joe
as
for
ever
remains
open
to
the
question
pip
but
in
regard
to
wisiting
miss
havisham
she
might
think
you
wanted
something
expected
something
of
her
don
t
you
think
i
might
say
that
i
did
not
joe
you
might
old
chap
said
joe
and
she
might
credit
it
similarly
she
mightn
t
joe
felt
as
i
did
that
he
had
made
a
point
there
and
he
pulled
hard
at
his
pipe
to
keep
himself
from
weakening
it
by
repetition
you
see
pip
joe
pursued
as
soon
as
he
was
past
that
danger
miss
havisham
done
the
handsome
thing
by
you
when
miss
havisham
done
the
handsome
thing
by
you
she
called
me
back
to
say
to
me
as
that
were
all
yes
joe
i
heard
her
all
joe
repeated
very
emphatically
yes
joe
i
tell
you
i
heard
her
which
i
meantersay
pip
it
might
be
that
her
meaning
were
make
a
end
on
it
as
you
was
me
to
the
north
and
you
to
the
south
keep
in
sunders
i
had
thought
of
that
too
and
it
was
very
far
from
comforting
to
me
to
find
that
he
had
thought
of
it
for
it
seemed
to
render
it
more
probable
but
joe
yes
old
chap
here
am
i
getting
on
in
the
first
year
of
my
time
and
since
the
day
of
my
being
bound
i
have
never
thanked
miss
havisham
or
asked
after
her
or
shown
that
i
remember
her
that
s
true
pip
and
unless
you
was
to
turn
her
out
a
set
of
shoes
all
four
round
and
which
i
meantersay
as
even
a
set
of
shoes
all
four
round
might
not
be
acceptable
as
a
present
in
a
total
wacancy
of
hoofs
i
don
t
mean
that
sort
of
remembrance
joe
i
don
t
mean
a
present
but
joe
had
got
the
idea
of
a
present
in
his
head
and
must
harp
upon
it
or
even
said
he
if
you
was
helped
to
knocking
her
up
a
new
chain
for
the
front
door
or
say
a
gross
or
two
of
shark
headed
screws
for
general
use
or
some
light
fancy
article
such
as
a
toasting
fork
when
she
took
her
muffins
or
a
gridiron
when
she
took
a
sprat
or
such
like
i
don
t
mean
any
present
at
all
joe
i
interposed
well
said
joe
still
harping
on
it
as
though
i
had
particularly
pressed
it
if
i
was
yourself
pip
i
wouldn
t
no
i
would
not
for
what
s
a
door
chain
when
she
s
got
one
always
up
and
shark
headers
is
open
to
misrepresentations
and
if
it
was
a
toasting
fork
you
d
go
into
brass
and
do
yourself
no
credit
and
the
oncommonest
workman
can
t
show
himself
oncommon
in
a
gridiron
for
a
gridiron
is
a
gridiron
said
joe
steadfastly
impressing
it
upon
me
as
if
he
were
endeavouring
to
rouse
me
from
a
fixed
delusion
and
you
may
haim
at
what
you
like
but
a
gridiron
it
will
come
out
either
by
your
leave
or
again
your
leave
and
you
can
t
help
yourself
my
dear
joe
i
cried
in
desperation
taking
hold
of
his
coat
don
t
go
on
in
that
way
i
never
thought
of
making
miss
havisham
any
present
no
pip
joe
assented
as
if
he
had
been
contending
for
that
all
along
and
what
i
say
to
you
is
you
are
right
pip
yes
joe
but
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
as
we
are
rather
slack
just
now
if
you
would
give
me
a
half
holiday
to
morrow
i
think
i
would
go
up
town
and
make
a
call
on
miss
est
havisham
which
her
name
said
joe
gravely
ain
t
estavisham
pip
unless
she
have
been
rechris
ened
i
know
joe
i
know
it
was
a
slip
of
mine
what
do
you
think
of
it
joe
in
brief
joe
thought
that
if
i
thought
well
of
it
he
thought
well
of
it
but
he
was
particular
in
stipulating
that
if
i
were
not
received
with
cordiality
or
if
i
were
not
encouraged
to
repeat
my
visit
as
a
visit
which
had
no
ulterior
object
but
was
simply
one
of
gratitude
for
a
favor
received
then
this
experimental
trip
should
have
no
successor
by
these
conditions
i
promised
to
abide
now
joe
kept
a
journeyman
at
weekly
wages
whose
name
was
orlick
he
pretended
that
his
christian
name
was
dolge
a
clear
impossibility
but
he
was
a
fellow
of
that
obstinate
disposition
that
i
believe
him
to
have
been
the
prey
of
no
delusion
in
this
particular
but
wilfully
to
have
imposed
that
name
upon
the
village
as
an
affront
to
its
understanding
he
was
a
broadshouldered
loose
limbed
swarthy
fellow
of
great
strength
never
in
a
hurry
and
always
slouching
he
never
even
seemed
to
come
to
his
work
on
purpose
but
would
slouch
in
as
if
by
mere
accident
and
when
he
went
to
the
jolly
bargemen
to
eat
his
dinner
or
went
away
at
night
he
would
slouch
out
like
cain
or
the
wandering
jew
as
if
he
had
no
idea
where
he
was
going
and
no
intention
of
ever
coming
back
he
lodged
at
a
sluice
keeper
s
out
on
the
marshes
and
on
working
days
would
come
slouching
from
his
hermitage
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
dinner
loosely
tied
in
a
bundle
round
his
neck
and
dangling
on
his
back
on
sundays
he
mostly
lay
all
day
on
the
sluice
gates
or
stood
against
ricks
and
barns
he
always
slouched
locomotively
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
when
accosted
or
otherwise
required
to
raise
them
he
looked
up
in
a
half
resentful
half
puzzled
way
as
though
the
only
thought
he
ever
had
was
that
it
was
rather
an
odd
and
injurious
fact
that
he
should
never
be
thinking
this
morose
journeyman
had
no
liking
for
me
when
i
was
very
small
and
timid
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
devil
lived
in
a
black
corner
of
the
forge
and
that
he
knew
the
fiend
very
well
also
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
up
the
fire
once
in
seven
years
with
a
live
boy
and
that
i
might
consider
myself
fuel
when
i
became
joe
s
prentice
orlick
was
perhaps
confirmed
in
some
suspicion
that
i
should
displace
him
howbeit
he
liked
me
still
less
not
that
he
ever
said
anything
or
did
anything
openly
importing
hostility
i
only
noticed
that
he
always
beat
his
sparks
in
my
direction
and
that
whenever
i
sang
old
clem
he
came
in
out
of
time
dolge
orlick
was
at
work
and
present
next
day
when
i
reminded
joe
of
my
half
holiday
he
said
nothing
at
the
moment
for
he
and
joe
had
just
got
a
piece
of
hot
iron
between
them
and
i
was
at
the
bellows
but
by
and
by
he
said
leaning
on
his
hammer
now
master
sure
you
re
not
a
going
to
favor
only
one
of
us
if
young
pip
has
a
half
holiday
do
as
much
for
old
orlick
i
suppose
he
was
about
five
and
twenty
but
he
usually
spoke
of
himself
as
an
ancient
person
why
what
ll
you
do
with
a
half
holiday
if
you
get
it
said
joe
what
ll
i
do
with
it
what
ll
he
do
with
it
i
ll
do
as
much
with
it
as
him
said
orlick
as
to
pip
he
s
going
up
town
said
joe
well
then
as
to
old
orlick
he
s
a
going
up
town
retorted
that
worthy
two
can
go
up
town
tain
t
only
one
wot
can
go
up
town
don
t
lose
your
temper
said
joe
shall
if
i
like
growled
orlick
some
and
their
up
towning
now
master
come
no
favoring
in
this
shop
be
a
man
the
master
refusing
to
entertain
the
subject
until
the
journeyman
was
in
a
better
temper
orlick
plunged
at
the
furnace
drew
out
a
red
hot
bar
made
at
me
with
it
as
if
he
were
going
to
run
it
through
my
body
whisked
it
round
my
head
laid
it
on
the
anvil
hammered
it
out
as
if
it
were
i
i
thought
and
the
sparks
were
my
spirting
blood
and
finally
said
when
he
had
hammered
himself
hot
and
the
iron
cold
and
he
again
leaned
on
his
hammer
now
master
are
you
all
right
now
demanded
joe
ah
i
am
all
right
said
gruff
old
orlick
then
as
in
general
you
stick
to
your
work
as
well
as
most
men
said
joe
let
it
be
a
half
holiday
for
all
my
sister
had
been
standing
silent
in
the
yard
within
hearing
she
was
a
most
unscrupulous
spy
and
listener
and
she
instantly
looked
in
at
one
of
the
windows
like
you
you
fool
said
she
to
joe
giving
holidays
to
great
idle
hulkers
like
that
you
are
a
rich
man
upon
my
life
to
waste
wages
in
that
way
i
wish
i
was
his
master
you
d
be
everybody
s
master
if
you
durst
retorted
orlick
with
an
ill
favored
grin
let
her
alone
said
joe
i
d
be
a
match
for
all
noodles
and
all
rogues
returned
my
sister
beginning
to
work
herself
into
a
mighty
rage
and
i
couldn
t
be
a
match
for
the
noodles
without
being
a
match
for
your
master
who
s
the
dunder
headed
king
of
the
noodles
and
i
couldn
t
be
a
match
for
the
rogues
without
being
a
match
for
you
who
are
the
blackest
looking
and
the
worst
rogue
between
this
and
france
now
you
re
a
foul
shrew
mother
gargery
growled
the
journeyman
if
that
makes
a
judge
of
rogues
you
ought
to
be
a
good
un
let
her
alone
will
you
said
joe
what
did
you
say
cried
my
sister
beginning
to
scream
what
did
you
say
what
did
that
fellow
orlick
say
to
me
pip
what
did
he
call
me
with
my
husband
standing
by
oh
oh
oh
each
of
these
exclamations
was
a
shriek
and
i
must
remark
of
my
sister
what
is
equally
true
of
all
the
violent
women
i
have
ever
seen
that
passion
was
no
excuse
for
her
because
it
is
undeniable
that
instead
of
lapsing
into
passion
she
consciously
and
deliberately
took
extraordinary
pains
to
force
herself
into
it
and
became
blindly
furious
by
regular
stages
what
was
the
name
he
gave
me
before
the
base
man
who
swore
to
defend
me
oh
hold
me
oh
ah
h
h
growled
the
journeyman
between
his
teeth
i
d
hold
you
if
you
was
my
wife
i
d
hold
you
under
the
pump
and
choke
it
out
of
you
i
tell
you
let
her
alone
said
joe
oh
to
hear
him
cried
my
sister
with
a
clap
of
her
hands
and
a
scream
together
which
was
her
next
stage
to
hear
the
names
he
s
giving
me
that
orlick
in
my
own
house
me
a
married
woman
with
my
husband
standing
by
oh
oh
here
my
sister
after
a
fit
of
clappings
and
screamings
beat
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
and
upon
her
knees
and
threw
her
cap
off
and
pulled
her
hair
down
which
were
the
last
stages
on
her
road
to
frenzy
being
by
this
time
a
perfect
fury
and
a
complete
success
she
made
a
dash
at
the
door
which
i
had
fortunately
locked
what
could
the
wretched
joe
do
now
after
his
disregarded
parenthetical
interruptions
but
stand
up
to
his
journeyman
and
ask
him
what
he
meant
by
interfering
betwixt
himself
and
mrs
joe
and
further
whether
he
was
man
enough
to
come
on
old
orlick
felt
that
the
situation
admitted
of
nothing
less
than
coming
on
and
was
on
his
defence
straightway
so
without
so
much
as
pulling
off
their
singed
and
burnt
aprons
they
went
at
one
another
like
two
giants
but
if
any
man
in
that
neighborhood
could
stand
uplong
against
joe
i
never
saw
the
man
orlick
as
if
he
had
been
of
no
more
account
than
the
pale
young
gentleman
was
very
soon
among
the
coal
dust
and
in
no
hurry
to
come
out
of
it
then
joe
unlocked
the
door
and
picked
up
my
sister
who
had
dropped
insensible
at
the
window
but
who
had
seen
the
fight
first
i
think
and
who
was
carried
into
the
house
and
laid
down
and
who
was
recommended
to
revive
and
would
do
nothing
but
struggle
and
clench
her
hands
in
joe
s
hair
then
came
that
singular
calm
and
silence
which
succeed
all
uproars
and
then
with
the
vague
sensation
which
i
have
always
connected
with
such
a
lull
namely
that
it
was
sunday
and
somebody
was
dead
i
went
up
stairs
to
dress
myself
when
i
came
down
again
i
found
joe
and
orlick
sweeping
up
without
any
other
traces
of
discomposure
than
a
slit
in
one
of
orlick
s
nostrils
which
was
neither
expressive
nor
ornamental
a
pot
of
beer
had
appeared
from
the
jolly
bargemen
and
they
were
sharing
it
by
turns
in
a
peaceable
manner
the
lull
had
a
sedative
and
philosophical
influence
on
joe
who
followed
me
out
into
the
road
to
say
as
a
parting
observation
that
might
do
me
good
on
the
rampage
pip
and
off
the
rampage
pip
such
is
life
with
what
absurd
emotions
for
we
think
the
feelings
that
are
very
serious
in
a
man
quite
comical
in
a
boy
i
found
myself
again
going
to
miss
havisham
s
matters
little
here
nor
how
i
passed
and
repassed
the
gate
many
times
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
ring
nor
how
i
debated
whether
i
should
go
away
without
ringing
nor
how
i
should
undoubtedly
have
gone
if
my
time
had
been
my
own
to
come
back
miss
sarah
pocket
came
to
the
gate
no
estella
how
then
you
here
again
said
miss
pocket
what
do
you
want
when
i
said
that
i
only
came
to
see
how
miss
havisham
was
sarah
evidently
deliberated
whether
or
no
she
should
send
me
about
my
business
but
unwilling
to
hazard
the
responsibility
she
let
me
in
and
presently
brought
the
sharp
message
that
i
was
to
come
up
everything
was
unchanged
and
miss
havisham
was
alone
well
said
she
fixing
her
eyes
upon
me
i
hope
you
want
nothing
you
ll
get
nothing
no
indeed
miss
havisham
i
only
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
am
doing
very
well
in
my
apprenticeship
and
am
always
much
obliged
to
you
there
there
with
the
old
restless
fingers
come
now
and
then
come
on
your
birthday
ay
she
cried
suddenly
turning
herself
and
her
chair
towards
me
you
are
looking
round
for
estella
hey
i
had
been
looking
round
in
fact
for
estella
and
i
stammered
that
i
hoped
she
was
well
abroad
said
miss
havisham
educating
for
a
lady
far
out
of
reach
prettier
than
ever
admired
by
all
who
see
her
do
you
feel
that
you
have
lost
her
there
was
such
a
malignant
enjoyment
in
her
utterance
of
the
last
words
and
she
broke
into
such
a
disagreeable
laugh
that
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
she
spared
me
the
trouble
of
considering
by
dismissing
me
when
the
gate
was
closed
upon
me
by
sarah
of
the
walnut
shell
countenance
i
felt
more
than
ever
dissatisfied
with
my
home
and
with
my
trade
and
with
everything
and
that
was
all
i
took
by
that
motion
as
i
was
loitering
along
the
high
street
looking
in
disconsolately
at
the
shop
windows
and
thinking
what
i
would
buy
if
i
were
a
gentleman
who
should
come
out
of
the
bookshop
but
mr
wopsle
mr
wopsle
had
in
his
hand
the
affecting
tragedy
of
george
barnwell
in
which
he
had
that
moment
invested
sixpence
with
the
view
of
heaping
every
word
of
it
on
the
head
of
pumblechook
with
whom
he
was
going
to
drink
tea
no
sooner
did
he
see
me
than
he
appeared
to
consider
that
a
special
providence
had
put
a
prentice
in
his
way
to
be
read
at
and
he
laid
hold
of
me
and
insisted
on
my
accompanying
him
to
the
pumblechookian
parlor
as
i
knew
it
would
be
miserable
at
home
and
as
the
nights
were
dark
and
the
way
was
dreary
and
almost
any
companionship
on
the
road
was
better
than
none
i
made
no
great
resistance
consequently
we
turned
into
pumblechook
s
just
as
the
street
and
the
shops
were
lighting
up
as
i
never
assisted
at
any
other
representation
of
george
barnwell
i
don
t
know
how
long
it
may
usually
take
but
i
know
very
well
that
it
took
until
half
past
nine
o
clock
that
night
and
that
when
mr
wopsle
got
into
newgate
i
thought
he
never
would
go
to
the
scaffold
he
became
so
much
slower
than
at
any
former
period
of
his
disgraceful
career
i
thought
it
a
little
too
much
that
he
should
complain
of
being
cut
short
in
his
flower
after
all
as
if
he
had
not
been
running
to
seed
leaf
after
leaf
ever
since
his
course
began
this
however
was
a
mere
question
of
length
and
wearisomeness
what
stung
me
was
the
identification
of
the
whole
affair
with
my
unoffending
self
when
barnwell
began
to
go
wrong
i
declare
that
i
felt
positively
apologetic
pumblechook
s
indignant
stare
so
taxed
me
with
it
wopsle
too
took
pains
to
present
me
in
the
worst
light
at
once
ferocious
and
maudlin
i
was
made
to
murder
my
uncle
with
no
extenuating
circumstances
whatever
millwood
put
me
down
in
argument
on
every
occasion
it
became
sheer
monomania
in
my
master
s
daughter
to
care
a
button
for
me
and
all
i
can
say
for
my
gasping
and
procrastinating
conduct
on
the
fatal
morning
is
that
it
was
worthy
of
the
general
feebleness
of
my
character
even
after
i
was
happily
hanged
and
wopsle
had
closed
the
book
pumblechook
sat
staring
at
me
and
shaking
his
head
and
saying
take
warning
boy
take
warning
as
if
it
were
a
well
known
fact
that
i
contemplated
murdering
a
near
relation
provided
i
could
only
induce
one
to
have
the
weakness
to
become
my
benefactor
it
was
a
very
dark
night
when
it
was
all
over
and
when
i
set
out
with
mr
wopsle
on
the
walk
home
beyond
town
we
found
a
heavy
mist
out
and
it
fell
wet
and
thick
the
turnpike
lamp
was
a
blur
quite
out
of
the
lamp
s
usual
place
apparently
and
its
rays
looked
solid
substance
on
the
fog
we
were
noticing
this
and
saying
how
that
the
mist
rose
with
a
change
of
wind
from
a
certain
quarter
of
our
marshes
when
we
came
upon
a
man
slouching
under
the
lee
of
the
turnpike
house
halloa
we
said
stopping
orlick
there
ah
he
answered
slouching
out
i
was
standing
by
a
minute
on
the
chance
of
company
you
are
late
i
remarked
orlick
not
unnaturally
answered
well
and
you
re
late
we
have
been
said
mr
wopsle
exalted
with
his
late
performance
we
have
been
indulging
mr
orlick
in
an
intellectual
evening
old
orlick
growled
as
if
he
had
nothing
to
say
about
that
and
we
all
went
on
together
i
asked
him
presently
whether
he
had
been
spending
his
half
holiday
up
and
down
town
yes
said
he
all
of
it
i
come
in
behind
yourself
i
didn
t
see
you
but
i
must
have
been
pretty
close
behind
you
by
the
by
the
guns
is
going
again
at
the
hulks
said
i
ay
there
s
some
of
the
birds
flown
from
the
cages
the
guns
have
been
going
since
dark
about
you
ll
hear
one
presently
in
effect
we
had
not
walked
many
yards
further
when
the
well
remembered
boom
came
towards
us
deadened
by
the
mist
and
heavily
rolled
away
along
the
low
grounds
by
the
river
as
if
it
were
pursuing
and
threatening
the
fugitives
a
good
night
for
cutting
off
in
said
orlick
we
d
be
puzzled
how
to
bring
down
a
jail
bird
on
the
wing
to
night
the
subject
was
a
suggestive
one
to
me
and
i
thought
about
it
in
silence
mr
wopsle
as
the
ill
requited
uncle
of
the
evening
s
tragedy
fell
to
meditating
aloud
in
his
garden
at
camberwell
orlick
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
slouched
heavily
at
my
side
it
was
very
dark
very
wet
very
muddy
and
so
we
splashed
along
now
and
then
the
sound
of
the
signal
cannon
broke
upon
us
again
and
again
rolled
sulkily
along
the
course
of
the
river
i
kept
myself
to
myself
and
my
thoughts
mr
wopsle
died
amiably
at
camberwell
and
exceedingly
game
on
bosworth
field
and
in
the
greatest
agonies
at
glastonbury
orlick
sometimes
growled
beat
it
out
beat
it
out
old
clem
with
a
clink
for
the
stout
old
clem
i
thought
he
had
been
drinking
but
he
was
not
drunk
thus
we
came
to
the
village
the
way
by
which
we
approached
it
took
us
past
the
three
jolly
bargemen
which
we
were
surprised
to
find
it
being
eleven
o
clock
in
a
state
of
commotion
with
the
door
wide
open
and
unwonted
lights
that
had
been
hastily
caught
up
and
put
down
scattered
about
mr
wopsle
dropped
in
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
surmising
that
a
convict
had
been
taken
but
came
running
out
in
a
great
hurry
there
s
something
wrong
said
he
without
stopping
up
at
your
place
pip
run
all
what
is
it
i
asked
keeping
up
with
him
so
did
orlick
at
my
side
i
can
t
quite
understand
the
house
seems
to
have
been
violently
entered
when
joe
gargery
was
out
supposed
by
convicts
somebody
has
been
attacked
and
hurt
we
were
running
too
fast
to
admit
of
more
being
said
and
we
made
no
stop
until
we
got
into
our
kitchen
it
was
full
of
people
the
whole
village
was
there
or
in
the
yard
and
there
was
a
surgeon
and
there
was
joe
and
there
were
a
group
of
women
all
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
kitchen
the
unemployed
bystanders
drew
back
when
they
saw
me
and
so
i
became
aware
of
my
sister
lying
without
sense
or
movement
on
the
bare
boards
where
she
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
dealt
by
some
unknown
hand
when
her
face
was
turned
towards
the
fire
destined
never
to
be
on
the
rampage
again
while
she
was
the
wife
of
joe
chapter
xvi
with
my
head
full
of
george
barnwell
i
was
at
first
disposed
to
believe
that
i
must
have
had
some
hand
in
the
attack
upon
my
sister
or
at
all
events
that
as
her
near
relation
popularly
known
to
be
under
obligations
to
her
i
was
a
more
legitimate
object
of
suspicion
than
any
one
else
but
when
in
the
clearer
light
of
next
morning
i
began
to
reconsider
the
matter
and
to
hear
it
discussed
around
me
on
all
sides
i
took
another
view
of
the
case
which
was
more
reasonable
joe
had
been
at
the
three
jolly
bargemen
smoking
his
pipe
from
a
quarter
after
eight
o
clock
to
a
quarter
before
ten
while
he
was
there
my
sister
had
been
seen
standing
at
the
kitchen
door
and
had
exchanged
good
night
with
a
farm
laborer
going
home
the
man
could
not
be
more
particular
as
to
the
time
at
which
he
saw
her
he
got
into
dense
confusion
when
he
tried
to
be
than
that
it
must
have
been
before
nine
when
joe
went
home
at
five
minutes
before
ten
he
found
her
struck
down
on
the
floor
and
promptly
called
in
assistance
the
fire
had
not
then
burnt
unusually
low
nor
was
the
snuff
of
the
candle
very
long
the
candle
however
had
been
blown
out
nothing
had
been
taken
away
from
any
part
of
the
house
neither
beyond
the
blowing
out
of
the
candle
which
stood
on
a
table
between
the
door
and
my
sister
and
was
behind
her
when
she
stood
facing
the
fire
and
was
struck
was
there
any
disarrangement
of
the
kitchen
excepting
such
as
she
herself
had
made
in
falling
and
bleeding
but
there
was
one
remarkable
piece
of
evidence
on
the
spot
she
had
been
struck
with
something
blunt
and
heavy
on
the
head
and
spine
after
the
blows
were
dealt
something
heavy
had
been
thrown
down
at
her
with
considerable
violence
as
she
lay
on
her
face
and
on
the
ground
beside
her
when
joe
picked
her
up
was
a
convict
s
leg
iron
which
had
been
filed
asunder
now
joe
examining
this
iron
with
a
smith
s
eye
declared
it
to
have
been
filed
asunder
some
time
ago
the
hue
and
cry
going
off
to
the
hulks
and
people
coming
thence
to
examine
the
iron
joe
s
opinion
was
corroborated
they
did
not
undertake
to
say
when
it
had
left
the
prison
ships
to
which
it
undoubtedly
had
once
belonged
but
they
claimed
to
know
for
certain
that
that
particular
manacle
had
not
been
worn
by
either
of
the
two
convicts
who
had
escaped
last
night
further
one
of
those
two
was
already
retaken
and
had
not
freed
himself
of
his
iron
knowing
what
i
knew
i
set
up
an
inference
of
my
own
here
i
believed
the
iron
to
be
my
convict
s
iron
the
iron
i
had
seen
and
heard
him
filing
at
on
the
marshes
but
my
mind
did
not
accuse
him
of
having
put
it
to
its
latest
use
for
i
believed
one
of
two
other
persons
to
have
become
possessed
of
it
and
to
have
turned
it
to
this
cruel
account
either
orlick
or
the
strange
man
who
had
shown
me
the
file
now
as
to
orlick
he
had
gone
to
town
exactly
as
he
told
us
when
we
picked
him
up
at
the
turnpike
he
had
been
seen
about
town
all
the
evening
he
had
been
in
divers
companies
in
several
public
houses
and
he
had
come
back
with
myself
and
mr
wopsle
there
was
nothing
against
him
save
the
quarrel
and
my
sister
had
quarrelled
with
him
and
with
everybody
else
about
her
ten
thousand
times
as
to
the
strange
man
if
he
had
come
back
for
his
two
bank
notes
there
could
have
been
no
dispute
about
them
because
my
sister
was
fully
prepared
to
restore
them
besides
there
had
been
no
altercation
the
assailant
had
come
in
so
silently
and
suddenly
that
she
had
been
felled
before
she
could
look
round
it
was
horrible
to
think
that
i
had
provided
the
weapon
however
undesignedly
but
i
could
hardly
think
otherwise
i
suffered
unspeakable
trouble
while
i
considered
and
reconsidered
whether
i
should
at
last
dissolve
that
spell
of
my
childhood
and
tell
joe
all
the
story
for
months
afterwards
i
every
day
settled
the
question
finally
in
the
negative
and
reopened
and
reargued
it
next
morning
the
contention
came
after
all
to
this
the
secret
was
such
an
old
one
now
had
so
grown
into
me
and
become
a
part
of
myself
that
i
could
not
tear
it
away
in
addition
to
the
dread
that
having
led
up
to
so
much
mischief
it
would
be
now
more
likely
than
ever
to
alienate
joe
from
me
if
he
believed
it
i
had
a
further
restraining
dread
that
he
would
not
believe
it
but
would
assort
it
with
the
fabulous
dogs
and
veal
cutlets
as
a
monstrous
invention
however
i
temporized
with
myself
of
course
for
was
i
not
wavering
between
right
and
wrong
when
the
thing
is
always
done
and
resolved
to
make
a
full
disclosure
if
i
should
see
any
such
new
occasion
as
a
new
chance
of
helping
in
the
discovery
of
the
assailant
the
constables
and
the
bow
street
men
from
london
for
this
happened
in
the
days
of
the
extinct
red
waistcoated
police
were
about
the
house
for
a
week
or
two
and
did
pretty
much
what
i
have
heard
and
read
of
like
authorities
doing
in
other
such
cases
they
took
up
several
obviously
wrong
people
and
they
ran
their
heads
very
hard
against
wrong
ideas
and
persisted
in
trying
to
fit
the
circumstances
to
the
ideas
instead
of
trying
to
extract
ideas
from
the
circumstances
also
they
stood
about
the
door
of
the
jolly
bargemen
with
knowing
and
reserved
looks
that
filled
the
whole
neighborhood
with
admiration
and
they
had
a
mysterious
manner
of
taking
their
drink
that
was
almost
as
good
as
taking
the
culprit
but
not
quite
for
they
never
did
it
long
after
these
constitutional
powers
had
dispersed
my
sister
lay
very
ill
in
bed
her
sight
was
disturbed
so
that
she
saw
objects
multiplied
and
grasped
at
visionary
teacups
and
wineglasses
instead
of
the
realities
her
hearing
was
greatly
impaired
her
memory
also
and
her
speech
was
unintelligible
when
at
last
she
came
round
so
far
as
to
be
helped
down
stairs
it
was
still
necessary
to
keep
my
slate
always
by
her
that
she
might
indicate
in
writing
what
she
could
not
indicate
in
speech
as
she
was
very
bad
handwriting
apart
a
more
than
indifferent
speller
and
as
joe
was
a
more
than
indifferent
reader
extraordinary
complications
arose
between
them
which
i
was
always
called
in
to
solve
the
administration
of
mutton
instead
of
medicine
the
substitution
of
tea
for
joe
and
the
baker
for
bacon
were
among
the
mildest
of
my
own
mistakes
however
her
temper
was
greatly
improved
and
she
was
patient
a
tremulous
uncertainty
of
the
action
of
all
her
limbs
soon
became
a
part
of
her
regular
state
and
afterwards
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
months
she
would
often
put
her
hands
to
her
head
and
would
then
remain
for
about
a
week
at
a
time
in
some
gloomy
aberration
of
mind
we
were
at
a
loss
to
find
a
suitable
attendant
for
her
until
a
circumstance
happened
conveniently
to
relieve
us
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
conquered
a
confirmed
habit
of
living
into
which
she
had
fallen
and
biddy
became
a
part
of
our
establishment
it
may
have
been
about
a
month
after
my
sister
s
reappearance
in
the
kitchen
when
biddy
came
to
us
with
a
small
speckled
box
containing
the
whole
of
her
worldly
effects
and
became
a
blessing
to
the
household
above
all
she
was
a
blessing
to
joe
for
the
dear
old
fellow
was
sadly
cut
up
by
the
constant
contemplation
of
the
wreck
of
his
wife
and
had
been
accustomed
while
attending
on
her
of
an
evening
to
turn
to
me
every
now
and
then
and
say
with
his
blue
eyes
moistened
such
a
fine
figure
of
a
woman
as
she
once
were
pip
biddy
instantly
taking
the
cleverest
charge
of
her
as
though
she
had
studied
her
from
infancy
joe
became
able
in
some
sort
to
appreciate
the
greater
quiet
of
his
life
and
to
get
down
to
the
jolly
bargemen
now
and
then
for
a
change
that
did
him
good
it
was
characteristic
of
the
police
people
that
they
had
all
more
or
less
suspected
poor
joe
though
he
never
knew
it
and
that
they
had
to
a
man
concurred
in
regarding
him
as
one
of
the
deepest
spirits
they
had
ever
encountered
biddy
s
first
triumph
in
her
new
office
was
to
solve
a
difficulty
that
had
completely
vanquished
me
i
had
tried
hard
at
it
but
had
made
nothing
of
it
thus
it
was
again
and
again
and
again
my
sister
had
traced
upon
the
slate
a
character
that
looked
like
a
curious
t
and
then
with
the
utmost
eagerness
had
called
our
attention
to
it
as
something
she
particularly
wanted
i
had
in
vain
tried
everything
producible
that
began
with
a
t
from
tar
to
toast
and
tub
at
length
it
had
come
into
my
head
that
the
sign
looked
like
a
hammer
and
on
my
lustily
calling
that
word
in
my
sister
s
ear
she
had
begun
to
hammer
on
the
table
and
had
expressed
a
qualified
assent
thereupon
i
had
brought
in
all
our
hammers
one
after
another
but
without
avail
then
i
bethought
me
of
a
crutch
the
shape
being
much
the
same
and
i
borrowed
one
in
the
village
and
displayed
it
to
my
sister
with
considerable
confidence
but
she
shook
her
head
to
that
extent
when
she
was
shown
it
that
we
were
terrified
lest
in
her
weak
and
shattered
state
she
should
dislocate
her
neck
when
my
sister
found
that
biddy
was
very
quick
to
understand
her
this
mysterious
sign
reappeared
on
the
slate
biddy
looked
thoughtfully
at
it
heard
my
explanation
looked
thoughtfully
at
my
sister
looked
thoughtfully
at
joe
who
was
always
represented
on
the
slate
by
his
initial
letter
and
ran
into
the
forge
followed
by
joe
and
me
why
of
course
cried
biddy
with
an
exultant
face
don
t
you
see
it
s
him
orlick
without
a
doubt
she
had
lost
his
name
and
could
only
signify
him
by
his
hammer
we
told
him
why
we
wanted
him
to
come
into
the
kitchen
and
he
slowly
laid
down
his
hammer
wiped
his
brow
with
his
arm
took
another
wipe
at
it
with
his
apron
and
came
slouching
out
with
a
curious
loose
vagabond
bend
in
the
knees
that
strongly
distinguished
him
i
confess
that
i
expected
to
see
my
sister
denounce
him
and
that
i
was
disappointed
by
the
different
result
she
manifested
the
greatest
anxiety
to
be
on
good
terms
with
him
was
evidently
much
pleased
by
his
being
at
length
produced
and
motioned
that
she
would
have
him
given
something
to
drink
she
watched
his
countenance
as
if
she
were
particularly
wishful
to
be
assured
that
he
took
kindly
to
his
reception
she
showed
every
possible
desire
to
conciliate
him
and
there
was
an
air
of
humble
propitiation
in
all
she
did
such
as
i
have
seen
pervade
the
bearing
of
a
child
towards
a
hard
master
after
that
day
a
day
rarely
passed
without
her
drawing
the
hammer
on
her
slate
and
without
orlick
s
slouching
in
and
standing
doggedly
before
her
as
if
he
knew
no
more
than
i
did
what
to
make
of
it
chapter
xvii
i
now
fell
into
a
regular
routine
of
apprenticeship
life
which
was
varied
beyond
the
limits
of
the
village
and
the
marshes
by
no
more
remarkable
circumstance
than
the
arrival
of
my
birthday
and
my
paying
another
visit
to
miss
havisham
i
found
miss
sarah
pocket
still
on
duty
at
the
gate
i
found
miss
havisham
just
as
i
had
left
her
and
she
spoke
of
estella
in
the
very
same
way
if
not
in
the
very
same
words
the
interview
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
and
she
gave
me
a
guinea
when
i
was
going
and
told
me
to
come
again
on
my
next
birthday
i
may
mention
at
once
that
this
became
an
annual
custom
i
tried
to
decline
taking
the
guinea
on
the
first
occasion
but
with
no
better
effect
than
causing
her
to
ask
me
very
angrily
if
i
expected
more
then
and
after
that
i
took
it
so
unchanging
was
the
dull
old
house
the
yellow
light
in
the
darkened
room
the
faded
spectre
in
the
chair
by
the
dressing
table
glass
that
i
felt
as
if
the
stopping
of
the
clocks
had
stopped
time
in
that
mysterious
place
and
while
i
and
everything
else
outside
it
grew
older
it
stood
still
daylight
never
entered
the
house
as
to
my
thoughts
and
remembrances
of
it
any
more
than
as
to
the
actual
fact
it
bewildered
me
and
under
its
influence
i
continued
at
heart
to
hate
my
trade
and
to
be
ashamed
of
home
imperceptibly
i
became
conscious
of
a
change
in
biddy
however
her
shoes
came
up
at
the
heel
her
hair
grew
bright
and
neat
her
hands
were
always
clean
she
was
not
beautiful
she
was
common
and
could
not
be
like
estella
but
she
was
pleasant
and
wholesome
and
sweet
tempered
she
had
not
been
with
us
more
than
a
year
i
remember
her
being
newly
out
of
mourning
at
the
time
it
struck
me
when
i
observed
to
myself
one
evening
that
she
had
curiously
thoughtful
and
attentive
eyes
eyes
that
were
very
pretty
and
very
good
it
came
of
my
lifting
up
my
own
eyes
from
a
task
i
was
poring
at
writing
some
passages
from
a
book
to
improve
myself
in
two
ways
at
once
by
a
sort
of
stratagem
and
seeing
biddy
observant
of
what
i
was
about
i
laid
down
my
pen
and
biddy
stopped
in
her
needlework
without
laying
it
down
biddy
said
i
how
do
you
manage
it
either
i
am
very
stupid
or
you
are
very
clever
what
is
it
that
i
manage
i
don
t
know
returned
biddy
smiling
she
managed
our
whole
domestic
life
and
wonderfully
too
but
i
did
not
mean
that
though
that
made
what
i
did
mean
more
surprising
how
do
you
manage
biddy
said
i
to
learn
everything
that
i
learn
and
always
to
keep
up
with
me
i
was
beginning
to
be
rather
vain
of
my
knowledge
for
i
spent
my
birthday
guineas
on
it
and
set
aside
the
greater
part
of
my
pocket
money
for
similar
investment
though
i
have
no
doubt
now
that
the
little
i
knew
was
extremely
dear
at
the
price
i
might
as
well
ask
you
said
biddy
how
you
manage
no
because
when
i
come
in
from
the
forge
of
a
night
any
one
can
see
me
turning
to
at
it
but
you
never
turn
to
at
it
biddy
i
suppose
i
must
catch
it
like
a
cough
said
biddy
quietly
and
went
on
with
her
sewing
pursuing
my
idea
as
i
leaned
back
in
my
wooden
chair
and
looked
at
biddy
sewing
away
with
her
head
on
one
side
i
began
to
think
her
rather
an
extraordinary
girl
for
i
called
to
mind
now
that
she
was
equally
accomplished
in
the
terms
of
our
trade
and
the
names
of
our
different
sorts
of
work
and
our
various
tools
in
short
whatever
i
knew
biddy
knew
theoretically
she
was
already
as
good
a
blacksmith
as
i
or
better
you
are
one
of
those
biddy
said
i
who
make
the
most
of
every
chance
you
never
had
a
chance
before
you
came
here
and
see
how
improved
you
are
biddy
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
and
went
on
with
her
sewing
i
was
your
first
teacher
though
wasn
t
i
said
she
as
she
sewed
biddy
i
exclaimed
in
amazement
why
you
are
crying
no
i
am
not
said
biddy
looking
up
and
laughing
what
put
that
in
your
head
what
could
have
put
it
in
my
head
but
the
glistening
of
a
tear
as
it
dropped
on
her
work
i
sat
silent
recalling
what
a
drudge
she
had
been
until
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
successfully
overcame
that
bad
habit
of
living
so
highly
desirable
to
be
got
rid
of
by
some
people
i
recalled
the
hopeless
circumstances
by
which
she
had
been
surrounded
in
the
miserable
little
shop
and
the
miserable
little
noisy
evening
school
with
that
miserable
old
bundle
of
incompetence
always
to
be
dragged
and
shouldered
i
reflected
that
even
in
those
untoward
times
there
must
have
been
latent
in
biddy
what
was
now
developing
for
in
my
first
uneasiness
and
discontent
i
had
turned
to
her
for
help
as
a
matter
of
course
biddy
sat
quietly
sewing
shedding
no
more
tears
and
while
i
looked
at
her
and
thought
about
it
all
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
i
had
not
been
sufficiently
grateful
to
biddy
i
might
have
been
too
reserved
and
should
have
patronized
her
more
though
i
did
not
use
that
precise
word
in
my
meditations
with
my
confidence
yes
biddy
i
observed
when
i
had
done
turning
it
over
you
were
my
first
teacher
and
that
at
a
time
when
we
little
thought
of
ever
being
together
like
this
in
this
kitchen
ah
poor
thing
replied
biddy
it
was
like
her
self
forgetfulness
to
transfer
the
remark
to
my
sister
and
to
get
up
and
be
busy
about
her
making
her
more
comfortable
that
s
sadly
true
well
said
i
we
must
talk
together
a
little
more
as
we
used
to
do
and
i
must
consult
you
a
little
more
as
i
used
to
do
let
us
have
a
quiet
walk
on
the
marshes
next
sunday
biddy
and
a
long
chat
my
sister
was
never
left
alone
now
but
joe
more
than
readily
undertook
the
care
of
her
on
that
sunday
afternoon
and
biddy
and
i
went
out
together
it
was
summer
time
and
lovely
weather
when
we
had
passed
the
village
and
the
church
and
the
churchyard
and
were
out
on
the
marshes
and
began
to
see
the
sails
of
the
ships
as
they
sailed
on
i
began
to
combine
miss
havisham
and
estella
with
the
prospect
in
my
usual
way
when
we
came
to
the
river
side
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
with
the
water
rippling
at
our
feet
making
it
all
more
quiet
than
it
would
have
been
without
that
sound
i
resolved
that
it
was
a
good
time
and
place
for
the
admission
of
biddy
into
my
inner
confidence
biddy
said
i
after
binding
her
to
secrecy
i
want
to
be
a
gentleman
o
i
wouldn
t
if
i
was
you
she
returned
i
don
t
think
it
would
answer
biddy
said
i
with
some
severity
i
have
particular
reasons
for
wanting
to
be
a
gentleman
you
know
best
pip
but
don
t
you
think
you
are
happier
as
you
are
biddy
i
exclaimed
impatiently
i
am
not
at
all
happy
as
i
am
i
am
disgusted
with
my
calling
and
with
my
life
i
have
never
taken
to
either
since
i
was
bound
don
t
be
absurd
was
i
absurd
said
biddy
quietly
raising
her
eyebrows
i
am
sorry
for
that
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
i
only
want
you
to
do
well
and
to
be
comfortable
well
then
understand
once
for
all
that
i
never
shall
or
can
be
comfortable
or
anything
but
miserable
there
biddy
unless
i
can
lead
a
very
different
sort
of
life
from
the
life
i
lead
now
that
s
a
pity
said
biddy
shaking
her
head
with
a
sorrowful
air
now
i
too
had
so
often
thought
it
a
pity
that
in
the
singular
kind
of
quarrel
with
myself
which
i
was
always
carrying
on
i
was
half
inclined
to
shed
tears
of
vexation
and
distress
when
biddy
gave
utterance
to
her
sentiment
and
my
own
i
told
her
she
was
right
and
i
knew
it
was
much
to
be
regretted
but
still
it
was
not
to
be
helped
if
i
could
have
settled
down
i
said
to
biddy
plucking
up
the
short
grass
within
reach
much
as
i
had
once
upon
a
time
pulled
my
feelings
out
of
my
hair
and
kicked
them
into
the
brewery
wall
if
i
could
have
settled
down
and
been
but
half
as
fond
of
the
forge
as
i
was
when
i
was
little
i
know
it
would
have
been
much
better
for
me
you
and
i
and
joe
would
have
wanted
nothing
then
and
joe
and
i
would
perhaps
have
gone
partners
when
i
was
out
of
my
time
and
i
might
even
have
grown
up
to
keep
company
with
you
and
we
might
have
sat
on
this
very
bank
on
a
fine
sunday
quite
different
people
i
should
have
been
good
enough
for
you
shouldn
t
i
biddy
biddy
sighed
as
she
looked
at
the
ships
sailing
on
and
returned
for
answer
yes
i
am
not
over
particular
it
scarcely
sounded
flattering
but
i
knew
she
meant
well
instead
of
that
said
i
plucking
up
more
grass
and
chewing
a
blade
or
two
see
how
i
am
going
on
dissatisfied
and
uncomfortable
and
what
would
it
signify
to
me
being
coarse
and
common
if
nobody
had
told
me
so
biddy
turned
her
face
suddenly
towards
mine
and
looked
far
more
attentively
at
me
than
she
had
looked
at
the
sailing
ships
it
was
neither
a
very
true
nor
a
very
polite
thing
to
say
she
remarked
directing
her
eyes
to
the
ships
again
who
said
it
i
was
disconcerted
for
i
had
broken
away
without
quite
seeing
where
i
was
going
to
it
was
not
to
be
shuffled
off
now
however
and
i
answered
the
beautiful
young
lady
at
miss
havisham
s
and
she
s
more
beautiful
than
anybody
ever
was
and
i
admire
her
dreadfully
and
i
want
to
be
a
gentleman
on
her
account
having
made
this
lunatic
confession
i
began
to
throw
my
torn
up
grass
into
the
river
as
if
i
had
some
thoughts
of
following
it
do
you
want
to
be
a
gentleman
to
spite
her
or
to
gain
her
over
biddy
quietly
asked
me
after
a
pause
i
don
t
know
i
moodily
answered
because
if
it
is
to
spite
her
biddy
pursued
i
should
think
but
you
know
best
that
might
be
better
and
more
independently
done
by
caring
nothing
for
her
words
and
if
it
is
to
gain
her
over
i
should
think
but
you
know
best
she
was
not
worth
gaining
over
exactly
what
i
myself
had
thought
many
times
exactly
what
was
perfectly
manifest
to
me
at
the
moment
but
how
could
i
a
poor
dazed
village
lad
avoid
that
wonderful
inconsistency
into
which
the
best
and
wisest
of
men
fall
every
day
it
may
be
all
quite
true
said
i
to
biddy
but
i
admire
her
dreadfully
in
short
i
turned
over
on
my
face
when
i
came
to
that
and
got
a
good
grasp
on
the
hair
on
each
side
of
my
head
and
wrenched
it
well
all
the
while
knowing
the
madness
of
my
heart
to
be
so
very
mad
and
misplaced
that
i
was
quite
conscious
it
would
have
served
my
face
right
if
i
had
lifted
it
up
by
my
hair
and
knocked
it
against
the
pebbles
as
a
punishment
for
belonging
to
such
an
idiot
biddy
was
the
wisest
of
girls
and
she
tried
to
reason
no
more
with
me
she
put
her
hand
which
was
a
comfortable
hand
though
roughened
by
work
upon
my
hands
one
after
another
and
gently
took
them
out
of
my
hair
then
she
softly
patted
my
shoulder
in
a
soothing
way
while
with
my
face
upon
my
sleeve
i
cried
a
little
exactly
as
i
had
done
in
the
brewery
yard
and
felt
vaguely
convinced
that
i
was
very
much
ill
used
by
somebody
or
by
everybody
i
can
t
say
which
i
am
glad
of
one
thing
said
biddy
and
that
is
that
you
have
felt
you
could
give
me
your
confidence
pip
and
i
am
glad
of
another
thing
and
that
is
that
of
course
you
know
you
may
depend
upon
my
keeping
it
and
always
so
far
deserving
it
if
your
first
teacher
dear
such
a
poor
one
and
so
much
in
need
of
being
taught
herself
had
been
your
teacher
at
the
present
time
she
thinks
she
knows
what
lesson
she
would
set
but
it
would
be
a
hard
one
to
learn
and
you
have
got
beyond
her
and
it
s
of
no
use
now
so
with
a
quiet
sigh
for
me
biddy
rose
from
the
bank
and
said
with
a
fresh
and
pleasant
change
of
voice
shall
we
walk
a
little
farther
or
go
home
biddy
i
cried
getting
up
putting
my
arm
round
her
neck
and
giving
her
a
kiss
i
shall
always
tell
you
everything
till
you
re
a
gentleman
said
biddy
you
know
i
never
shall
be
so
that
s
always
not
that
i
have
any
occasion
to
tell
you
anything
for
you
know
everything
i
know
as
i
told
you
at
home
the
other
night
ah
said
biddy
quite
in
a
whisper
as
she
looked
away
at
the
ships
and
then
repeated
with
her
former
pleasant
change
shall
we
walk
a
little
farther
or
go
home
i
said
to
biddy
we
would
walk
a
little
farther
and
we
did
so
and
the
summer
afternoon
toned
down
into
the
summer
evening
and
it
was
very
beautiful
i
began
to
consider
whether
i
was
not
more
naturally
and
wholesomely
situated
after
all
in
these
circumstances
than
playing
beggar
my
neighbor
by
candle
light
in
the
room
with
the
stopped
clocks
and
being
despised
by
estella
i
thought
it
would
be
very
good
for
me
if
i
could
get
her
out
of
my
head
with
all
the
rest
of
those
remembrances
and
fancies
and
could
go
to
work
determined
to
relish
what
i
had
to
do
and
stick
to
it
and
make
the
best
of
it
i
asked
myself
the
question
whether
i
did
not
surely
know
that
if
estella
were
beside
me
at
that
moment
instead
of
biddy
she
would
make
me
miserable
i
was
obliged
to
admit
that
i
did
know
it
for
a
certainty
and
i
said
to
myself
pip
what
a
fool
you
are
we
talked
a
good
deal
as
we
walked
and
all
that
biddy
said
seemed
right
biddy
was
never
insulting
or
capricious
or
biddy
to
day
and
somebody
else
to
morrow
she
would
have
derived
only
pain
and
no
pleasure
from
giving
me
pain
she
would
far
rather
have
wounded
her
own
breast
than
mine
how
could
it
be
then
that
i
did
not
like
her
much
the
better
of
the
two
biddy
said
i
when
we
were
walking
homeward
i
wish
you
could
put
me
right
i
wish
i
could
said
biddy
if
i
could
only
get
myself
to
fall
in
love
with
you
you
don
t
mind
my
speaking
so
openly
to
such
an
old
acquaintance
oh
dear
not
at
all
said
biddy
don
t
mind
me
if
i
could
only
get
myself
to
do
it
that
would
be
the
thing
for
me
but
you
never
will
you
see
said
biddy
it
did
not
appear
quite
so
unlikely
to
me
that
evening
as
it
would
have
done
if
we
had
discussed
it
a
few
hours
before
i
therefore
observed
i
was
not
quite
sure
of
that
but
biddy
said
she
was
and
she
said
it
decisively
in
my
heart
i
believed
her
to
be
right
and
yet
i
took
it
rather
ill
too
that
she
should
be
so
positive
on
the
point
when
we
came
near
the
churchyard
we
had
to
cross
an
embankment
and
get
over
a
stile
near
a
sluice
gate
there
started
up
from
the
gate
or
from
the
rushes
or
from
the
ooze
which
was
quite
in
his
stagnant
way
old
orlick
halloa
he
growled
where
are
you
two
going
where
should
we
be
going
but
home
well
then
said
he
i
m
jiggered
if
i
don
t
see
you
home
this
penalty
of
being
jiggered
was
a
favorite
supposititious
case
of
his
he
attached
no
definite
meaning
to
the
word
that
i
am
aware
of
but
used
it
like
his
own
pretended
christian
name
to
affront
mankind
and
convey
an
idea
of
something
savagely
damaging
when
i
was
younger
i
had
had
a
general
belief
that
if
he
had
jiggered
me
personally
he
would
have
done
it
with
a
sharp
and
twisted
hook
biddy
was
much
against
his
going
with
us
and
said
to
me
in
a
whisper
don
t
let
him
come
i
don
t
like
him
as
i
did
not
like
him
either
i
took
the
liberty
of
saying
that
we
thanked
him
but
we
didn
t
want
seeing
home
he
received
that
piece
of
information
with
a
yell
of
laughter
and
dropped
back
but
came
slouching
after
us
at
a
little
distance
curious
to
know
whether
biddy
suspected
him
of
having
had
a
hand
in
that
murderous
attack
of
which
my
sister
had
never
been
able
to
give
any
account
i
asked
her
why
she
did
not
like
him
oh
she
replied
glancing
over
her
shoulder
as
he
slouched
after
us
because
i
i
am
afraid
he
likes
me
did
he
ever
tell
you
he
liked
you
i
asked
indignantly
no
said
biddy
glancing
over
her
shoulder
again
he
never
told
me
so
but
he
dances
at
me
whenever
he
can
catch
my
eye
however
novel
and
peculiar
this
testimony
of
attachment
i
did
not
doubt
the
accuracy
of
the
interpretation
i
was
very
hot
indeed
upon
old
orlick
s
daring
to
admire
her
as
hot
as
if
it
were
an
outrage
on
myself
but
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
you
know
said
biddy
calmly
no
biddy
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
only
i
don
t
like
it
i
don
t
approve
of
it
nor
i
neither
said
biddy
though
that
makes
no
difference
to
you
exactly
said
i
but
i
must
tell
you
i
should
have
no
opinion
of
you
biddy
if
he
danced
at
you
with
your
own
consent
i
kept
an
eye
on
orlick
after
that
night
and
whenever
circumstances
were
favorable
to
his
dancing
at
biddy
got
before
him
to
obscure
that
demonstration
he
had
struck
root
in
joe
s
establishment
by
reason
of
my
sister
s
sudden
fancy
for
him
or
i
should
have
tried
to
get
him
dismissed
he
quite
understood
and
reciprocated
my
good
intentions
as
i
had
reason
to
know
thereafter
and
now
because
my
mind
was
not
confused
enough
before
i
complicated
its
confusion
fifty
thousand
fold
by
having
states
and
seasons
when
i
was
clear
that
biddy
was
immeasurably
better
than
estella
and
that
the
plain
honest
working
life
to
which
i
was
born
had
nothing
in
it
to
be
ashamed
of
but
offered
me
sufficient
means
of
self
respect
and
happiness
at
those
times
i
would
decide
conclusively
that
my
disaffection
to
dear
old
joe
and
the
forge
was
gone
and
that
i
was
growing
up
in
a
fair
way
to
be
partners
with
joe
and
to
keep
company
with
biddy
when
all
in
a
moment
some
confounding
remembrance
of
the
havisham
days
would
fall
upon
me
like
a
destructive
missile
and
scatter
my
wits
again
scattered
wits
take
a
long
time
picking
up
and
often
before
i
had
got
them
well
together
they
would
be
dispersed
in
all
directions
by
one
stray
thought
that
perhaps
after
all
miss
havisham
was
going
to
make
my
fortune
when
my
time
was
out
if
my
time
had
run
out
it
would
have
left
me
still
at
the
height
of
my
perplexities
i
dare
say
it
never
did
run
out
however
but
was
brought
to
a
premature
end
as
i
proceed
to
relate
chapter
xviii
it
was
in
the
fourth
year
of
my
apprenticeship
to
joe
and
it
was
a
saturday
night
there
was
a
group
assembled
round
the
fire
at
the
three
jolly
bargemen
attentive
to
mr
wopsle
as
he
read
the
newspaper
aloud
of
that
group
i
was
one
a
highly
popular
murder
had
been
committed
and
mr
wopsle
was
imbrued
in
blood
to
the
eyebrows
he
gloated
over
every
abhorrent
adjective
in
the
description
and
identified
himself
with
every
witness
at
the
inquest
he
faintly
moaned
i
am
done
for
as
the
victim
and
he
barbarously
bellowed
i
ll
serve
you
out
as
the
murderer
he
gave
the
medical
testimony
in
pointed
imitation
of
our
local
practitioner
and
he
piped
and
shook
as
the
aged
turnpike
keeper
who
had
heard
blows
to
an
extent
so
very
paralytic
as
to
suggest
a
doubt
regarding
the
mental
competency
of
that
witness
the
coroner
in
mr
wopsle
s
hands
became
timon
of
athens
the
beadle
coriolanus
he
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
and
we
all
enjoyed
ourselves
and
were
delightfully
comfortable
in
this
cosey
state
of
mind
we
came
to
the
verdict
wilful
murder
then
and
not
sooner
i
became
aware
of
a
strange
gentleman
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
settle
opposite
me
looking
on
there
was
an
expression
of
contempt
on
his
face
and
he
bit
the
side
of
a
great
forefinger
as
he
watched
the
group
of
faces
well
said
the
stranger
to
mr
wopsle
when
the
reading
was
done
you
have
settled
it
all
to
your
own
satisfaction
i
have
no
doubt
everybody
started
and
looked
up
as
if
it
were
the
murderer
he
looked
at
everybody
coldly
and
sarcastically
guilty
of
course
said
he
out
with
it
come
sir
returned
mr
wopsle
without
having
the
honor
of
your
acquaintance
i
do
say
guilty
upon
this
we
all
took
courage
to
unite
in
a
confirmatory
murmur
i
know
you
do
said
the
stranger
i
knew
you
would
i
told
you
so
but
now
i
ll
ask
you
a
question
do
you
know
or
do
you
not
know
that
the
law
of
england
supposes
every
man
to
be
innocent
until
he
is
proved
proved
to
be
guilty
sir
mr
wopsle
began
to
reply
as
an
englishman
myself
i
come
said
the
stranger
biting
his
forefinger
at
him
don
t
evade
the
question
either
you
know
it
or
you
don
t
know
it
which
is
it
to
be
he
stood
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
himself
on
one
side
in
a
bullying
interrogative
manner
and
he
threw
his
forefinger
at
mr
wopsle
as
it
were
to
mark
him
out
before
biting
it
again
now
said
he
do
you
know
it
or
don
t
you
know
it
certainly
i
know
it
replied
mr
wopsle
certainly
you
know
it
then
why
didn
t
you
say
so
at
first
now
i
ll
ask
you
another
question
taking
possession
of
mr
wopsle
as
if
he
had
a
right
to
him
do
you
know
that
none
of
these
witnesses
have
yet
been
cross
examined
mr
wopsle
was
beginning
i
can
only
say
when
the
stranger
stopped
him
what
you
won
t
answer
the
question
yes
or
no
now
i
ll
try
you
again
throwing
his
finger
at
him
again
attend
to
me
are
you
aware
or
are
you
not
aware
that
none
of
these
witnesses
have
yet
been
cross
examined
come
i
only
want
one
word
from
you
yes
or
no
mr
wopsle
hesitated
and
we
all
began
to
conceive
rather
a
poor
opinion
of
him
come
said
the
stranger
i
ll
help
you
you
don
t
deserve
help
but
i
ll
help
you
look
at
that
paper
you
hold
in
your
hand
what
is
it
what
is
it
repeated
mr
wopsle
eyeing
it
much
at
a
loss
is
it
pursued
the
stranger
in
his
most
sarcastic
and
suspicious
manner
the
printed
paper
you
have
just
been
reading
from
undoubtedly
undoubtedly
now
turn
to
that
paper
and
tell
me
whether
it
distinctly
states
that
the
prisoner
expressly
said
that
his
legal
advisers
instructed
him
altogether
to
reserve
his
defence
i
read
that
just
now
mr
wopsle
pleaded
never
mind
what
you
read
just
now
sir
i
don
t
ask
you
what
you
read
just
now
you
may
read
the
lord
s
prayer
backwards
if
you
like
and
perhaps
have
done
it
before
to
day
turn
to
the
paper
no
no
no
my
friend
not
to
the
top
of
the
column
you
know
better
than
that
to
the
bottom
to
the
bottom
we
all
began
to
think
mr
wopsle
full
of
subterfuge
well
have
you
found
it
here
it
is
said
mr
wopsle
now
follow
that
passage
with
your
eye
and
tell
me
whether
it
distinctly
states
that
the
prisoner
expressly
said
that
he
was
instructed
by
his
legal
advisers
wholly
to
reserve
his
defence
come
do
you
make
that
of
it
mr
wopsle
answered
those
are
not
the
exact
words
not
the
exact
words
repeated
the
gentleman
bitterly
is
that
the
exact
substance
yes
said
mr
wopsle
yes
repeated
the
stranger
looking
round
at
the
rest
of
the
company
with
his
right
hand
extended
towards
the
witness
wopsle
and
now
i
ask
you
what
you
say
to
the
conscience
of
that
man
who
with
that
passage
before
his
eyes
can
lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow
after
having
pronounced
a
fellow
creature
guilty
unheard
we
all
began
to
suspect
that
mr
wopsle
was
not
the
man
we
had
thought
him
and
that
he
was
beginning
to
be
found
out
and
that
same
man
remember
pursued
the
gentleman
throwing
his
finger
at
mr
wopsle
heavily
that
same
man
might
be
summoned
as
a
juryman
upon
this
very
trial
and
having
thus
deeply
committed
himself
might
return
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
and
lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow
after
deliberately
swearing
that
he
would
well
and
truly
try
the
issue
joined
between
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
and
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
and
would
a
true
verdict
give
according
to
the
evidence
so
help
him
god
we
were
all
deeply
persuaded
that
the
unfortunate
wopsle
had
gone
too
far
and
had
better
stop
in
his
reckless
career
while
there
was
yet
time
the
strange
gentleman
with
an
air
of
authority
not
to
be
disputed
and
with
a
manner
expressive
of
knowing
something
secret
about
every
one
of
us
that
would
effectually
do
for
each
individual
if
he
chose
to
disclose
it
left
the
back
of
the
settle
and
came
into
the
space
between
the
two
settles
in
front
of
the
fire
where
he
remained
standing
his
left
hand
in
his
pocket
and
he
biting
the
forefinger
of
his
right
from
information
i
have
received
said
he
looking
round
at
us
as
we
all
quailed
before
him
i
have
reason
to
believe
there
is
a
blacksmith
among
you
by
name
joseph
or
joe
gargery
which
is
the
man
here
is
the
man
said
joe
the
strange
gentleman
beckoned
him
out
of
his
place
and
joe
went
you
have
an
apprentice
pursued
the
stranger
commonly
known
as
pip
is
he
here
i
am
here
i
cried
the
stranger
did
not
recognize
me
but
i
recognized
him
as
the
gentleman
i
had
met
on
the
stairs
on
the
occasion
of
my
second
visit
to
miss
havisham
i
had
known
him
the
moment
i
saw
him
looking
over
the
settle
and
now
that
i
stood
confronting
him
with
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
i
checked
off
again
in
detail
his
large
head
his
dark
complexion
his
deep
set
eyes
his
bushy
black
eyebrows
his
large
watch
chain
his
strong
black
dots
of
beard
and
whisker
and
even
the
smell
of
scented
soap
on
his
great
hand
i
wish
to
have
a
private
conference
with
you
two
said
he
when
he
had
surveyed
me
at
his
leisure
it
will
take
a
little
time
perhaps
we
had
better
go
to
your
place
of
residence
i
prefer
not
to
anticipate
my
communication
here
you
will
impart
as
much
or
as
little
of
it
as
you
please
to
your
friends
afterwards
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
amidst
a
wondering
silence
we
three
walked
out
of
the
jolly
bargemen
and
in
a
wondering
silence
walked
home
while
going
along
the
strange
gentleman
occasionally
looked
at
me
and
occasionally
bit
the
side
of
his
finger
as
we
neared
home
joe
vaguely
acknowledging
the
occasion
as
an
impressive
and
ceremonious
one
went
on
ahead
to
open
the
front
door
our
conference
was
held
in
the
state
parlor
which
was
feebly
lighted
by
one
candle
it
began
with
the
strange
gentleman
s
sitting
down
at
the
table
drawing
the
candle
to
him
and
looking
over
some
entries
in
his
pocket
book
he
then
put
up
the
pocket
book
and
set
the
candle
a
little
aside
after
peering
round
it
into
the
darkness
at
joe
and
me
to
ascertain
which
was
which
my
name
he
said
is
jaggers
and
i
am
a
lawyer
in
london
i
am
pretty
well
known
i
have
unusual
business
to
transact
with
you
and
i
commence
by
explaining
that
it
is
not
of
my
originating
if
my
advice
had
been
asked
i
should
not
have
been
here
it
was
not
asked
and
you
see
me
here
what
i
have
to
do
as
the
confidential
agent
of
another
i
do
no
less
no
more
finding
that
he
could
not
see
us
very
well
from
where
he
sat
he
got
up
and
threw
one
leg
over
the
back
of
a
chair
and
leaned
upon
it
thus
having
one
foot
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
one
foot
on
the
ground
now
joseph
gargery
i
am
the
bearer
of
an
offer
to
relieve
you
of
this
young
fellow
your
apprentice
you
would
not
object
to
cancel
his
indentures
at
his
request
and
for
his
good
you
would
want
nothing
for
so
doing
lord
forbid
that
i
should
want
anything
for
not
standing
in
pip
s
way
said
joe
staring
lord
forbidding
is
pious
but
not
to
the
purpose
returned
mr
jaggers
the
question
is
would
you
want
anything
do
you
want
anything
the
answer
is
returned
joe
sternly
no
i
thought
mr
jaggers
glanced
at
joe
as
if
he
considered
him
a
fool
for
his
disinterestedness
but
i
was
too
much
bewildered
between
breathless
curiosity
and
surprise
to
be
sure
of
it
very
well
said
mr
jaggers
recollect
the
admission
you
have
made
and
don
t
try
to
go
from
it
presently
who
s
a
going
to
try
retorted
joe
i
don
t
say
anybody
is
do
you
keep
a
dog
yes
i
do
keep
a
dog
bear
in
mind
then
that
brag
is
a
good
dog
but
holdfast
is
a
better
bear
that
in
mind
will
you
repeated
mr
jaggers
shutting
his
eyes
and
nodding
his
head
at
joe
as
if
he
were
forgiving
him
something
now
i
return
to
this
young
fellow
and
the
communication
i
have
got
to
make
is
that
he
has
great
expectations
joe
and
i
gasped
and
looked
at
one
another
i
am
instructed
to
communicate
to
him
said
mr
jaggers
throwing
his
finger
at
me
sideways
that
he
will
come
into
a
handsome
property
further
that
it
is
the
desire
of
the
present
possessor
of
that
property
that
he
be
immediately
removed
from
his
present
sphere
of
life
and
from
this
place
and
be
brought
up
as
a
gentleman
in
a
word
as
a
young
fellow
of
great
expectations
my
dream
was
out
my
wild
fancy
was
surpassed
by
sober
reality
miss
havisham
was
going
to
make
my
fortune
on
a
grand
scale
now
mr
pip
pursued
the
lawyer
i
address
the
rest
of
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
you
are
to
understand
first
that
it
is
the
request
of
the
person
from
whom
i
take
my
instructions
that
you
always
bear
the
name
of
pip
you
will
have
no
objection
i
dare
say
to
your
great
expectations
being
encumbered
with
that
easy
condition
but
if
you
have
any
objection
this
is
the
time
to
mention
it
my
heart
was
beating
so
fast
and
there
was
such
a
singing
in
my
ears
that
i
could
scarcely
stammer
i
had
no
objection
i
should
think
not
now
you
are
to
understand
secondly
mr
pip
that
the
name
of
the
person
who
is
your
liberal
benefactor
remains
a
profound
secret
until
the
person
chooses
to
reveal
it
i
am
empowered
to
mention
that
it
is
the
intention
of
the
person
to
reveal
it
at
first
hand
by
word
of
mouth
to
yourself
when
or
where
that
intention
may
be
carried
out
i
cannot
say
no
one
can
say
it
may
be
years
hence
now
you
are
distinctly
to
understand
that
you
are
most
positively
prohibited
from
making
any
inquiry
on
this
head
or
any
allusion
or
reference
however
distant
to
any
individual
whomsoever
as
the
individual
in
all
the
communications
you
may
have
with
me
if
you
have
a
suspicion
in
your
own
breast
keep
that
suspicion
in
your
own
breast
it
is
not
the
least
to
the
purpose
what
the
reasons
of
this
prohibition
are
they
may
be
the
strongest
and
gravest
reasons
or
they
may
be
mere
whim
this
is
not
for
you
to
inquire
into
the
condition
is
laid
down
your
acceptance
of
it
and
your
observance
of
it
as
binding
is
the
only
remaining
condition
that
i
am
charged
with
by
the
person
from
whom
i
take
my
instructions
and
for
whom
i
am
not
otherwise
responsible
that
person
is
the
person
from
whom
you
derive
your
expectations
and
the
secret
is
solely
held
by
that
person
and
by
me
again
not
a
very
difficult
condition
with
which
to
encumber
such
a
rise
in
fortune
but
if
you
have
any
objection
to
it
this
is
the
time
to
mention
it
speak
out
once
more
i
stammered
with
difficulty
that
i
had
no
objection
i
should
think
not
now
mr
pip
i
have
done
with
stipulations
though
he
called
me
mr
pip
and
began
rather
to
make
up
to
me
he
still
could
not
get
rid
of
a
certain
air
of
bullying
suspicion
and
even
now
he
occasionally
shut
his
eyes
and
threw
his
finger
at
me
while
he
spoke
as
much
as
to
express
that
he
knew
all
kinds
of
things
to
my
disparagement
if
he
only
chose
to
mention
them
we
come
next
to
mere
details
of
arrangement
you
must
know
that
although
i
have
used
the
term
expectations
more
than
once
you
are
not
endowed
with
expectations
only
there
is
already
lodged
in
my
hands
a
sum
of
money
amply
sufficient
for
your
suitable
education
and
maintenance
you
will
please
consider
me
your
guardian
oh
for
i
was
going
to
thank
him
i
tell
you
at
once
i
am
paid
for
my
services
or
i
shouldn
t
render
them
it
is
considered
that
you
must
be
better
educated
in
accordance
with
your
altered
position
and
that
you
will
be
alive
to
the
importance
and
necessity
of
at
once
entering
on
that
advantage
i
said
i
had
always
longed
for
it
never
mind
what
you
have
always
longed
for
mr
pip
he
retorted
keep
to
the
record
if
you
long
for
it
now
that
s
enough
am
i
answered
that
you
are
ready
to
be
placed
at
once
under
some
proper
tutor
is
that
it
i
stammered
yes
that
was
it
good
now
your
inclinations
are
to
be
consulted
i
don
t
think
that
wise
mind
but
it
s
my
trust
have
you
ever
heard
of
any
tutor
whom
you
would
prefer
to
another
i
had
never
heard
of
any
tutor
but
biddy
and
mr
wopsle
s
great
aunt
so
i
replied
in
the
negative
there
is
a
certain
tutor
of
whom
i
have
some
knowledge
who
i
think
might
suit
the
purpose
said
mr
jaggers
i
don
t
recommend
him
observe
because
i
never
recommend
anybody
the
gentleman
i
speak
of
is
one
mr
matthew
pocket
ah
i
caught
at
the
name
directly
miss
havisham
s
relation
the
matthew
whom
mr
and
mrs
camilla
had
spoken
of
the
matthew
whose
place
was
to
be
at
miss
havisham
s
head
when
she
lay
dead
in
her
bride
s
dress
on
the
bride
s
table
you
know
the
name
said
mr
jaggers
looking
shrewdly
at
me
and
then
shutting
up
his
eyes
while
he
waited
for
my
answer
my
answer
was
that
i
had
heard
of
the
name
oh
said
he
you
have
heard
of
the
name
but
the
question
is
what
do
you
say
of
it
i
said
or
tried
to
say
that
i
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
recommendation
no
my
young
friend
he
interrupted
shaking
his
great
head
very
slowly
recollect
yourself
not
recollecting
myself
i
began
again
that
i
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
recommendation
no
my
young
friend
he
interrupted
shaking
his
head
and
frowning
and
smiling
both
at
once
no
no
no
it
s
very
well
done
but
it
won
t
do
you
are
too
young
to
fix
me
with
it
recommendation
is
not
the
word
mr
pip
try
another
correcting
myself
i
said
that
i
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
mention
of
mr
matthew
pocket
that
s
more
like
it
cried
mr
jaggers
and
i
added
i
would
gladly
try
that
gentleman
good
you
had
better
try
him
in
his
own
house
the
way
shall
be
prepared
for
you
and
you
can
see
his
son
first
who
is
in
london
when
will
you
come
to
london
i
said
glancing
at
joe
who
stood
looking
on
motionless
that
i
supposed
i
could
come
directly
first
said
mr
jaggers
you
should
have
some
new
clothes
to
come
in
and
they
should
not
be
working
clothes
say
this
day
week
you
ll
want
some
money
shall
i
leave
you
twenty
guineas
he
produced
a
long
purse
with
the
greatest
coolness
and
counted
them
out
on
the
table
and
pushed
them
over
to
me
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
taken
his
leg
from
the
chair
he
sat
astride
of
the
chair
when
he
had
pushed
the
money
over
and
sat
swinging
his
purse
and
eyeing
joe
well
joseph
gargery
you
look
dumbfoundered
i
am
said
joe
in
a
very
decided
manner
it
was
understood
that
you
wanted
nothing
for
yourself
remember
it
were
understood
said
joe
and
it
are
understood
and
it
ever
will
be
similar
according
but
what
said
mr
jaggers
swinging
his
purse
what
if
it
was
in
my
instructions
to
make
you
a
present
as
compensation
as
compensation
what
for
joe
demanded
for
the
loss
of
his
services
joe
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
with
the
touch
of
a
woman
i
have
often
thought
him
since
like
the
steam
hammer
that
can
crush
a
man
or
pat
an
egg
shell
in
his
combination
of
strength
with
gentleness
pip
is
that
hearty
welcome
said
joe
to
go
free
with
his
services
to
honor
and
fortun
as
no
words
can
tell
him
but
if
you
think
as
money
can
make
compensation
to
me
for
the
loss
of
the
little
child
what
come
to
the
forge
and
ever
the
best
of
friends
o
dear
good
joe
whom
i
was
so
ready
to
leave
and
so
unthankful
to
i
see
you
again
with
your
muscular
blacksmith
s
arm
before
your
eyes
and
your
broad
chest
heaving
and
your
voice
dying
away
o
dear
good
faithful
tender
joe
i
feel
the
loving
tremble
of
your
hand
upon
my
arm
as
solemnly
this
day
as
if
it
had
been
the
rustle
of
an
angel
s
wing
but
i
encouraged
joe
at
the
time
i
was
lost
in
the
mazes
of
my
future
fortunes
and
could
not
retrace
the
by
paths
we
had
trodden
together
i
begged
joe
to
be
comforted
for
as
he
said
we
had
ever
been
the
best
of
friends
and
as
i
said
we
ever
would
be
so
joe
scooped
his
eyes
with
his
disengaged
wrist
as
if
he
were
bent
on
gouging
himself
but
said
not
another
word
mr
jaggers
had
looked
on
at
this
as
one
who
recognized
in
joe
the
village
idiot
and
in
me
his
keeper
when
it
was
over
he
said
weighing
in
his
hand
the
purse
he
had
ceased
to
swing
now
joseph
gargery
i
warn
you
this
is
your
last
chance
no
half
measures
with
me
if
you
mean
to
take
a
present
that
i
have
it
in
charge
to
make
you
speak
out
and
you
shall
have
it
if
on
the
contrary
you
mean
to
say
here
to
his
great
amazement
he
was
stopped
by
joe
s
suddenly
working
round
him
with
every
demonstration
of
a
fell
pugilistic
purpose
which
i
meantersay
cried
joe
that
if
you
come
into
my
place
bull
baiting
and
badgering
me
come
out
which
i
meantersay
as
sech
if
you
re
a
man
come
on
which
i
meantersay
that
what
i
say
i
meantersay
and
stand
or
fall
by
i
drew
joe
away
and
he
immediately
became
placable
merely
stating
to
me
in
an
obliging
manner
and
as
a
polite
expostulatory
notice
to
any
one
whom
it
might
happen
to
concern
that
he
were
not
a
going
to
be
bull
baited
and
badgered
in
his
own
place
mr
jaggers
had
risen
when
joe
demonstrated
and
had
backed
near
the
door
without
evincing
any
inclination
to
come
in
again
he
there
delivered
his
valedictory
remarks
they
were
these
well
mr
pip
i
think
the
sooner
you
leave
here
as
you
are
to
be
a
gentleman
the
better
let
it
stand
for
this
day
week
and
you
shall
receive
my
printed
address
in
the
meantime
you
can
take
a
hackney
coach
at
the
stage
coach
office
in
london
and
come
straight
to
me
understand
that
i
express
no
opinion
one
way
or
other
on
the
trust
i
undertake
i
am
paid
for
undertaking
it
and
i
do
so
now
understand
that
finally
understand
that
he
was
throwing
his
finger
at
both
of
us
and
i
think
would
have
gone
on
but
for
his
seeming
to
think
joe
dangerous
and
going
off
something
came
into
my
head
which
induced
me
to
run
after
him
as
he
was
going
down
to
the
jolly
bargemen
where
he
had
left
a
hired
carriage
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
jaggers
halloa
said
he
facing
round
what
s
the
matter
i
wish
to
be
quite
right
mr
jaggers
and
to
keep
to
your
directions
so
i
thought
i
had
better
ask
would
there
be
any
objection
to
my
taking
leave
of
any
one
i
know
about
here
before
i
go
away
no
said
he
looking
as
if
he
hardly
understood
me
i
don
t
mean
in
the
village
only
but
up
town
no
said
he
no
objection
i
thanked
him
and
ran
home
again
and
there
i
found
that
joe
had
already
locked
the
front
door
and
vacated
the
state
parlor
and
was
seated
by
the
kitchen
fire
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
gazing
intently
at
the
burning
coals
i
too
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
gazed
at
the
coals
and
nothing
was
said
for
a
long
time
my
sister
was
in
her
cushioned
chair
in
her
corner
and
biddy
sat
at
her
needle
work
before
the
fire
and
joe
sat
next
biddy
and
i
sat
next
joe
in
the
corner
opposite
my
sister
the
more
i
looked
into
the
glowing
coals
the
more
incapable
i
became
of
looking
at
joe
the
longer
the
silence
lasted
the
more
unable
i
felt
to
speak
at
length
i
got
out
joe
have
you
told
biddy
no
pip
returned
joe
still
looking
at
the
fire
and
holding
his
knees
tight
as
if
he
had
private
information
that
they
intended
to
make
off
somewhere
which
i
left
it
to
yourself
pip
i
would
rather
you
told
joe
pip
s
a
gentleman
of
fortun
then
said
joe
and
god
bless
him
in
it
biddy
dropped
her
work
and
looked
at
me
joe
held
his
knees
and
looked
at
me
i
looked
at
both
of
them
after
a
pause
they
both
heartily
congratulated
me
but
there
was
a
certain
touch
of
sadness
in
their
congratulations
that
i
rather
resented
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
impress
biddy
and
through
biddy
joe
with
the
grave
obligation
i
considered
my
friends
under
to
know
nothing
and
say
nothing
about
the
maker
of
my
fortune
it
would
all
come
out
in
good
time
i
observed
and
in
the
meanwhile
nothing
was
to
be
said
save
that
i
had
come
into
great
expectations
from
a
mysterious
patron
biddy
nodded
her
head
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
as
she
took
up
her
work
again
and
said
she
would
be
very
particular
and
joe
still
detaining
his
knees
said
ay
ay
i
ll
be
ekervally
partickler
pip
and
then
they
congratulated
me
again
and
went
on
to
express
so
much
wonder
at
the
notion
of
my
being
a
gentleman
that
i
didn
t
half
like
it
infinite
pains
were
then
taken
by
biddy
to
convey
to
my
sister
some
idea
of
what
had
happened
to
the
best
of
my
belief
those
efforts
entirely
failed
she
laughed
and
nodded
her
head
a
great
many
times
and
even
repeated
after
biddy
the
words
pip
and
property
but
i
doubt
if
they
had
more
meaning
in
them
than
an
election
cry
and
i
cannot
suggest
a
darker
picture
of
her
state
of
mind
i
never
could
have
believed
it
without
experience
but
as
joe
and
biddy
became
more
at
their
cheerful
ease
again
i
became
quite
gloomy
dissatisfied
with
my
fortune
of
course
i
could
not
be
but
it
is
possible
that
i
may
have
been
without
quite
knowing
it
dissatisfied
with
myself
any
how
i
sat
with
my
elbow
on
my
knee
and
my
face
upon
my
hand
looking
into
the
fire
as
those
two
talked
about
my
going
away
and
about
what
they
should
do
without
me
and
all
that
and
whenever
i
caught
one
of
them
looking
at
me
though
never
so
pleasantly
and
they
often
looked
at
me
particularly
biddy
i
felt
offended
as
if
they
were
expressing
some
mistrust
of
me
though
heaven
knows
they
never
did
by
word
or
sign
at
those
times
i
would
get
up
and
look
out
at
the
door
for
our
kitchen
door
opened
at
once
upon
the
night
and
stood
open
on
summer
evenings
to
air
the
room
the
very
stars
to
which
i
then
raised
my
eyes
i
am
afraid
i
took
to
be
but
poor
and
humble
stars
for
glittering
on
the
rustic
objects
among
which
i
had
passed
my
life
saturday
night
said
i
when
we
sat
at
our
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
five
more
days
and
then
the
day
before
the
day
they
ll
soon
go
yes
pip
observed
joe
whose
voice
sounded
hollow
in
his
beer
mug
they
ll
soon
go
soon
soon
go
said
biddy
i
have
been
thinking
joe
that
when
i
go
down
town
on
monday
and
order
my
new
clothes
i
shall
tell
the
tailor
that
i
ll
come
and
put
them
on
there
or
that
i
ll
have
them
sent
to
mr
pumblechook
s
it
would
be
very
disagreeable
to
be
stared
at
by
all
the
people
here
mr
and
mrs
hubble
might
like
to
see
you
in
your
new
gen
teel
figure
too
pip
said
joe
industriously
cutting
his
bread
with
his
cheese
on
it
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
and
glancing
at
my
untasted
supper
as
if
he
thought
of
the
time
when
we
used
to
compare
slices
so
might
wopsle
and
the
jolly
bargemen
might
take
it
as
a
compliment
that
s
just
what
i
don
t
want
joe
they
would
make
such
a
business
of
it
such
a
coarse
and
common
business
that
i
couldn
t
bear
myself
ah
that
indeed
pip
said
joe
if
you
couldn
t
abear
yourself
biddy
asked
me
here
as
she
sat
holding
my
sister
s
plate
have
you
thought
about
when
you
ll
show
yourself
to
mr
gargery
and
your
sister
and
me
you
will
show
yourself
to
us
won
t
you
biddy
i
returned
with
some
resentment
you
are
so
exceedingly
quick
that
it
s
difficult
to
keep
up
with
you
she
always
were
quick
observed
joe
if
you
had
waited
another
moment
biddy
you
would
have
heard
me
say
that
i
shall
bring
my
clothes
here
in
a
bundle
one
evening
most
likely
on
the
evening
before
i
go
away
biddy
said
no
more
handsomely
forgiving
her
i
soon
exchanged
an
affectionate
good
night
with
her
and
joe
and
went
up
to
bed
when
i
got
into
my
little
room
i
sat
down
and
took
a
long
look
at
it
as
a
mean
little
room
that
i
should
soon
be
parted
from
and
raised
above
for
ever
it
was
furnished
with
fresh
young
remembrances
too
and
even
at
the
same
moment
i
fell
into
much
the
same
confused
division
of
mind
between
it
and
the
better
rooms
to
which
i
was
going
as
i
had
been
in
so
often
between
the
forge
and
miss
havisham
s
and
biddy
and
estella
the
sun
had
been
shining
brightly
all
day
on
the
roof
of
my
attic
and
the
room
was
warm
as
i
put
the
window
open
and
stood
looking
out
i
saw
joe
come
slowly
forth
at
the
dark
door
below
and
take
a
turn
or
two
in
the
air
and
then
i
saw
biddy
come
and
bring
him
a
pipe
and
light
it
for
him
he
never
smoked
so
late
and
it
seemed
to
hint
to
me
that
he
wanted
comforting
for
some
reason
or
other
he
presently
stood
at
the
door
immediately
beneath
me
smoking
his
pipe
and
biddy
stood
there
too
quietly
talking
to
him
and
i
knew
that
they
talked
of
me
for
i
heard
my
name
mentioned
in
an
endearing
tone
by
both
of
them
more
than
once
i
would
not
have
listened
for
more
if
i
could
have
heard
more
so
i
drew
away
from
the
window
and
sat
down
in
my
one
chair
by
the
bedside
feeling
it
very
sorrowful
and
strange
that
this
first
night
of
my
bright
fortunes
should
be
the
loneliest
i
had
ever
known
looking
towards
the
open
window
i
saw
light
wreaths
from
joe
s
pipe
floating
there
and
i
fancied
it
was
like
a
blessing
from
joe
not
obtruded
on
me
or
paraded
before
me
but
pervading
the
air
we
shared
together
i
put
my
light
out
and
crept
into
bed
and
it
was
an
uneasy
bed
now
and
i
never
slept
the
old
sound
sleep
in
it
any
more
chapter
xix
morning
made
a
considerable
difference
in
my
general
prospect
of
life
and
brightened
it
so
much
that
it
scarcely
seemed
the
same
what
lay
heaviest
on
my
mind
was
the
consideration
that
six
days
intervened
between
me
and
the
day
of
departure
for
i
could
not
divest
myself
of
a
misgiving
that
something
might
happen
to
london
in
the
meanwhile
and
that
when
i
got
there
it
would
be
either
greatly
deteriorated
or
clean
gone
joe
and
biddy
were
very
sympathetic
and
pleasant
when
i
spoke
of
our
approaching
separation
but
they
only
referred
to
it
when
i
did
after
breakfast
joe
brought
out
my
indentures
from
the
press
in
the
best
parlor
and
we
put
them
in
the
fire
and
i
felt
that
i
was
free
with
all
the
novelty
of
my
emancipation
on
me
i
went
to
church
with
joe
and
thought
perhaps
the
clergyman
wouldn
t
have
read
that
about
the
rich
man
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
if
he
had
known
all
after
our
early
dinner
i
strolled
out
alone
purposing
to
finish
off
the
marshes
at
once
and
get
them
done
with
as
i
passed
the
church
i
felt
as
i
had
felt
during
service
in
the
morning
a
sublime
compassion
for
the
poor
creatures
who
were
destined
to
go
there
sunday
after
sunday
all
their
lives
through
and
to
lie
obscurely
at
last
among
the
low
green
mounds
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
do
something
for
them
one
of
these
days
and
formed
a
plan
in
outline
for
bestowing
a
dinner
of
roast
beef
and
plum
pudding
a
pint
of
ale
and
a
gallon
of
condescension
upon
everybody
in
the
village
if
i
had
often
thought
before
with
something
allied
to
shame
of
my
companionship
with
the
fugitive
whom
i
had
once
seen
limping
among
those
graves
what
were
my
thoughts
on
this
sunday
when
the
place
recalled
the
wretch
ragged
and
shivering
with
his
felon
iron
and
badge
my
comfort
was
that
it
happened
a
long
time
ago
and
that
he
had
doubtless
been
transported
a
long
way
off
and
that
he
was
dead
to
me
and
might
be
veritably
dead
into
the
bargain
no
more
low
wet
grounds
no
more
dikes
and
sluices
no
more
of
these
grazing
cattle
though
they
seemed
in
their
dull
manner
to
wear
a
more
respectful
air
now
and
to
face
round
in
order
that
they
might
stare
as
long
as
possible
at
the
possessor
of
such
great
expectations
farewell
monotonous
acquaintances
of
my
childhood
henceforth
i
was
for
london
and
greatness
not
for
smith
s
work
in
general
and
for
you
i
made
my
exultant
way
to
the
old
battery
and
lying
down
there
to
consider
the
question
whether
miss
havisham
intended
me
for
estella
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
i
was
much
surprised
to
find
joe
sitting
beside
me
smoking
his
pipe
he
greeted
me
with
a
cheerful
smile
on
my
opening
my
eyes
and
said
as
being
the
last
time
pip
i
thought
i
d
foller
and
joe
i
am
very
glad
you
did
so
thankee
pip
you
may
be
sure
dear
joe
i
went
on
after
we
had
shaken
hands
that
i
shall
never
forget
you
no
no
pip
said
joe
in
a
comfortable
tone
i
m
sure
of
that
ay
ay
old
chap
bless
you
it
were
only
necessary
to
get
it
well
round
in
a
man
s
mind
to
be
certain
on
it
but
it
took
a
bit
of
time
to
get
it
well
round
the
change
come
so
oncommon
plump
didn
t
it
somehow
i
was
not
best
pleased
with
joe
s
being
so
mightily
secure
of
me
i
should
have
liked
him
to
have
betrayed
emotion
or
to
have
said
it
does
you
credit
pip
or
something
of
that
sort
therefore
i
made
no
remark
on
joe
s
first
head
merely
saying
as
to
his
second
that
the
tidings
had
indeed
come
suddenly
but
that
i
had
always
wanted
to
be
a
gentleman
and
had
often
and
often
speculated
on
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
one
have
you
though
said
joe
astonishing
it
s
a
pity
now
joe
said
i
that
you
did
not
get
on
a
little
more
when
we
had
our
lessons
here
isn
t
it
well
i
don
t
know
returned
joe
i
m
so
awful
dull
i
m
only
master
of
my
own
trade
it
were
always
a
pity
as
i
was
so
awful
dull
but
it
s
no
more
of
a
pity
now
than
it
was
this
day
twelvemonth
don
t
you
see
what
i
had
meant
was
that
when
i
came
into
my
property
and
was
able
to
do
something
for
joe
it
would
have
been
much
more
agreeable
if
he
had
been
better
qualified
for
a
rise
in
station
he
was
so
perfectly
innocent
of
my
meaning
however
that
i
thought
i
would
mention
it
to
biddy
in
preference
so
when
we
had
walked
home
and
had
had
tea
i
took
biddy
into
our
little
garden
by
the
side
of
the
lane
and
after
throwing
out
in
a
general
way
for
the
elevation
of
her
spirits
that
i
should
never
forget
her
said
i
had
a
favor
to
ask
of
her
and
it
is
biddy
said
i
that
you
will
not
omit
any
opportunity
of
helping
joe
on
a
little
how
helping
him
on
asked
biddy
with
a
steady
sort
of
glance
well
joe
is
a
dear
good
fellow
in
fact
i
think
he
is
the
dearest
fellow
that
ever
lived
but
he
is
rather
backward
in
some
things
for
instance
biddy
in
his
learning
and
his
manners
although
i
was
looking
at
biddy
as
i
spoke
and
although
she
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
when
i
had
spoken
she
did
not
look
at
me
o
his
manners
won
t
his
manners
do
then
asked
biddy
plucking
a
black
currant
leaf
my
dear
biddy
they
do
very
well
here
o
they
do
very
well
here
interrupted
biddy
looking
closely
at
the
leaf
in
her
hand
hear
me
out
but
if
i
were
to
remove
joe
into
a
higher
sphere
as
i
shall
hope
to
remove
him
when
i
fully
come
into
my
property
they
would
hardly
do
him
justice
and
don
t
you
think
he
knows
that
asked
biddy
it
was
such
a
very
provoking
question
for
it
had
never
in
the
most
distant
manner
occurred
to
me
that
i
said
snappishly
biddy
what
do
you
mean
biddy
having
rubbed
the
leaf
to
pieces
between
her
hands
and
the
smell
of
a
black
currant
bush
has
ever
since
recalled
to
me
that
evening
in
the
little
garden
by
the
side
of
the
lane
said
have
you
never
considered
that
he
may
be
proud
proud
i
repeated
with
disdainful
emphasis
o
there
are
many
kinds
of
pride
said
biddy
looking
full
at
me
and
shaking
her
head
pride
is
not
all
of
one
kind
well
what
are
you
stopping
for
said
i
not
all
of
one
kind
resumed
biddy
he
may
be
too
proud
to
let
any
one
take
him
out
of
a
place
that
he
is
competent
to
fill
and
fills
well
and
with
respect
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
he
is
though
it
sounds
bold
in
me
to
say
so
for
you
must
know
him
far
better
than
i
do
now
biddy
said
i
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
this
in
you
i
did
not
expect
to
see
this
in
you
you
are
envious
biddy
and
grudging
you
are
dissatisfied
on
account
of
my
rise
in
fortune
and
you
can
t
help
showing
it
if
you
have
the
heart
to
think
so
returned
biddy
say
so
say
so
over
and
over
again
if
you
have
the
heart
to
think
so
if
you
have
the
heart
to
be
so
you
mean
biddy
said
i
in
a
virtuous
and
superior
tone
don
t
put
it
off
upon
me
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
it
and
it
s
a
it
s
a
bad
side
of
human
nature
i
did
intend
to
ask
you
to
use
any
little
opportunities
you
might
have
after
i
was
gone
of
improving
dear
joe
but
after
this
i
ask
you
nothing
i
am
extremely
sorry
to
see
this
in
you
biddy
i
repeated
it
s
a
it
s
a
bad
side
of
human
nature
whether
you
scold
me
or
approve
of
me
returned
poor
biddy
you
may
equally
depend
upon
my
trying
to
do
all
that
lies
in
my
power
here
at
all
times
and
whatever
opinion
you
take
away
of
me
shall
make
no
difference
in
my
remembrance
of
you
yet
a
gentleman
should
not
be
unjust
neither
said
biddy
turning
away
her
head
i
again
warmly
repeated
that
it
was
a
bad
side
of
human
nature
in
which
sentiment
waiving
its
application
i
have
since
seen
reason
to
think
i
was
right
and
i
walked
down
the
little
path
away
from
biddy
and
biddy
went
into
the
house
and
i
went
out
at
the
garden
gate
and
took
a
dejected
stroll
until
supper
time
again
feeling
it
very
sorrowful
and
strange
that
this
the
second
night
of
my
bright
fortunes
should
be
as
lonely
and
unsatisfactory
as
the
first
but
morning
once
more
brightened
my
view
and
i
extended
my
clemency
to
biddy
and
we
dropped
the
subject
putting
on
the
best
clothes
i
had
i
went
into
town
as
early
as
i
could
hope
to
find
the
shops
open
and
presented
myself
before
mr
trabb
the
tailor
who
was
having
his
breakfast
in
the
parlor
behind
his
shop
and
who
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
come
out
to
me
but
called
me
in
to
him
well
said
mr
trabb
in
a
hail
fellow
well
met
kind
of
way
how
are
you
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
mr
trabb
had
sliced
his
hot
roll
into
three
feather
beds
and
was
slipping
butter
in
between
the
blankets
and
covering
it
up
he
was
a
prosperous
old
bachelor
and
his
open
window
looked
into
a
prosperous
little
garden
and
orchard
and
there
was
a
prosperous
iron
safe
let
into
the
wall
at
the
side
of
his
fireplace
and
i
did
not
doubt
that
heaps
of
his
prosperity
were
put
away
in
it
in
bags
mr
trabb
said
i
it
s
an
unpleasant
thing
to
have
to
mention
because
it
looks
like
boasting
but
i
have
come
into
a
handsome
property
a
change
passed
over
mr
trabb
he
forgot
the
butter
in
bed
got
up
from
the
bedside
and
wiped
his
fingers
on
the
tablecloth
exclaiming
lord
bless
my
soul
i
am
going
up
to
my
guardian
in
london
said
i
casually
drawing
some
guineas
out
of
my
pocket
and
looking
at
them
and
i
want
a
fashionable
suit
of
clothes
to
go
in
i
wish
to
pay
for
them
i
added
otherwise
i
thought
he
might
only
pretend
to
make
them
with
ready
money
my
dear
sir
said
mr
trabb
as
he
respectfully
bent
his
body
opened
his
arms
and
took
the
liberty
of
touching
me
on
the
outside
of
each
elbow
don
t
hurt
me
by
mentioning
that
may
i
venture
to
congratulate
you
would
you
do
me
the
favor
of
stepping
into
the
shop
mr
trabb
s
boy
was
the
most
audacious
boy
in
all
that
country
side
when
i
had
entered
he
was
sweeping
the
shop
and
he
had
sweetened
his
labors
by
sweeping
over
me
he
was
still
sweeping
when
i
came
out
into
the
shop
with
mr
trabb
and
he
knocked
the
broom
against
all
possible
corners
and
obstacles
to
express
as
i
understood
it
equality
with
any
blacksmith
alive
or
dead
hold
that
noise
said
mr
trabb
with
the
greatest
sternness
or
i
ll
knock
your
head
off
do
me
the
favor
to
be
seated
sir
now
this
said
mr
trabb
taking
down
a
roll
of
cloth
and
tiding
it
out
in
a
flowing
manner
over
the
counter
preparatory
to
getting
his
hand
under
it
to
show
the
gloss
is
a
very
sweet
article
i
can
recommend
it
for
your
purpose
sir
because
it
really
is
extra
super
but
you
shall
see
some
others
give
me
number
four
you
to
the
boy
and
with
a
dreadfully
severe
stare
foreseeing
the
danger
of
that
miscreant
s
brushing
me
with
it
or
making
some
other
sign
of
familiarity
mr
trabb
never
removed
his
stern
eye
from
the
boy
until
he
had
deposited
number
four
on
the
counter
and
was
at
a
safe
distance
again
then
he
commanded
him
to
bring
number
five
and
number
eight
and
let
me
have
none
of
your
tricks
here
said
mr
trabb
or
you
shall
repent
it
you
young
scoundrel
the
longest
day
you
have
to
live
mr
trabb
then
bent
over
number
four
and
in
a
sort
of
deferential
confidence
recommended
it
to
me
as
a
light
article
for
summer
wear
an
article
much
in
vogue
among
the
nobility
and
gentry
an
article
that
it
would
ever
be
an
honor
to
him
to
reflect
upon
a
distinguished
fellow
townsman
s
if
he
might
claim
me
for
a
fellow
townsman
having
worn
are
you
bringing
numbers
five
and
eight
you
vagabond
said
mr
trabb
to
the
boy
after
that
or
shall
i
kick
you
out
of
the
shop
and
bring
them
myself
i
selected
the
materials
for
a
suit
with
the
assistance
of
mr
trabb
s
judgment
and
re
entered
the
parlor
to
be
measured
for
although
mr
trabb
had
my
measure
already
and
had
previously
been
quite
contented
with
it
he
said
apologetically
that
it
wouldn
t
do
under
existing
circumstances
sir
wouldn
t
do
at
all
so
mr
trabb
measured
and
calculated
me
in
the
parlor
as
if
i
were
an
estate
and
he
the
finest
species
of
surveyor
and
gave
himself
such
a
world
of
trouble
that
i
felt
that
no
suit
of
clothes
could
possibly
remunerate
him
for
his
pains
when
he
had
at
last
done
and
had
appointed
to
send
the
articles
to
mr
pumblechook
s
on
the
thursday
evening
he
said
with
his
hand
upon
the
parlor
lock
i
know
sir
that
london
gentlemen
cannot
be
expected
to
patronize
local
work
as
a
rule
but
if
you
would
give
me
a
turn
now
and
then
in
the
quality
of
a
townsman
i
should
greatly
esteem
it
good
morning
sir
much
obliged
door
the
last
word
was
flung
at
the
boy
who
had
not
the
least
notion
what
it
meant
but
i
saw
him
collapse
as
his
master
rubbed
me
out
with
his
hands
and
my
first
decided
experience
of
the
stupendous
power
of
money
was
that
it
had
morally
laid
upon
his
back
trabb
s
boy
after
this
memorable
event
i
went
to
the
hatter
s
and
the
bootmaker
s
and
the
hosier
s
and
felt
rather
like
mother
hubbard
s
dog
whose
outfit
required
the
services
of
so
many
trades
i
also
went
to
the
coach
office
and
took
my
place
for
seven
o
clock
on
saturday
morning
it
was
not
necessary
to
explain
everywhere
that
i
had
come
into
a
handsome
property
but
whenever
i
said
anything
to
that
effect
it
followed
that
the
officiating
tradesman
ceased
to
have
his
attention
diverted
through
the
window
by
the
high
street
and
concentrated
his
mind
upon
me
when
i
had
ordered
everything
i
wanted
i
directed
my
steps
towards
pumblechook
s
and
as
i
approached
that
gentleman
s
place
of
business
i
saw
him
standing
at
his
door
he
was
waiting
for
me
with
great
impatience
he
had
been
out
early
with
the
chaise
cart
and
had
called
at
the
forge
and
heard
the
news
he
had
prepared
a
collation
for
me
in
the
barnwell
parlor
and
he
too
ordered
his
shopman
to
come
out
of
the
gangway
as
my
sacred
person
passed
my
dear
friend
said
mr
pumblechook
taking
me
by
both
hands
when
he
and
i
and
the
collation
were
alone
i
give
you
joy
of
your
good
fortune
well
deserved
well
deserved
this
was
coming
to
the
point
and
i
thought
it
a
sensible
way
of
expressing
himself
to
think
said
mr
pumblechook
after
snorting
admiration
at
me
for
some
moments
that
i
should
have
been
the
humble
instrument
of
leading
up
to
this
is
a
proud
reward
i
begged
mr
pumblechook
to
remember
that
nothing
was
to
be
ever
said
or
hinted
on
that
point
my
dear
young
friend
said
mr
pumblechook
if
you
will
allow
me
to
call
you
so
i
murmured
certainly
and
mr
pumblechook
took
me
by
both
hands
again
and
communicated
a
movement
to
his
waistcoat
which
had
an
emotional
appearance
though
it
was
rather
low
down
my
dear
young
friend
rely
upon
my
doing
my
little
all
in
your
absence
by
keeping
the
fact
before
the
mind
of
joseph
joseph
said
mr
pumblechook
in
the
way
of
a
compassionate
adjuration
joseph
joseph
thereupon
he
shook
his
head
and
tapped
it
expressing
his
sense
of
deficiency
in
joseph
but
my
dear
young
friend
said
mr
pumblechook
you
must
be
hungry
you
must
be
exhausted
be
seated
here
is
a
chicken
had
round
from
the
boar
here
is
a
tongue
had
round
from
the
boar
here
s
one
or
two
little
things
had
round
from
the
boar
that
i
hope
you
may
not
despise
but
do
i
said
mr
pumblechook
getting
up
again
the
moment
after
he
had
sat
down
see
afore
me
him
as
i
ever
sported
with
in
his
times
of
happy
infancy
and
may
i
may
i
this
may
i
meant
might
he
shake
hands
i
consented
and
he
was
fervent
and
then
sat
down
again
here
is
wine
said
mr
pumblechook
let
us
drink
thanks
to
fortune
and
may
she
ever
pick
out
her
favorites
with
equal
judgment
and
yet
i
cannot
said
mr
pumblechook
getting
up
again
see
afore
me
one
and
likewise
drink
to
one
without
again
expressing
may
i
may
i
i
said
he
might
and
he
shook
hands
with
me
again
and
emptied
his
glass
and
turned
it
upside
down
i
did
the
same
and
if
i
had
turned
myself
upside
down
before
drinking
the
wine
could
not
have
gone
more
direct
to
my
head
mr
pumblechook
helped
me
to
the
liver
wing
and
to
the
best
slice
of
tongue
none
of
those
out
of
the
way
no
thoroughfares
of
pork
now
and
took
comparatively
speaking
no
care
of
himself
at
all
ah
poultry
poultry
you
little
thought
said
mr
pumblechook
apostrophizing
the
fowl
in
the
dish
when
you
was
a
young
fledgling
what
was
in
store
for
you
you
little
thought
you
was
to
be
refreshment
beneath
this
humble
roof
for
one
as
call
it
a
weakness
if
you
will
said
mr
pumblechook
getting
up
again
but
may
i
may
i
it
began
to
be
unnecessary
to
repeat
the
form
of
saying
he
might
so
he
did
it
at
once
how
he
ever
did
it
so
often
without
wounding
himself
with
my
knife
i
don
t
know
and
your
sister
he
resumed
after
a
little
steady
eating
which
had
the
honor
of
bringing
you
up
by
hand
it
s
a
sad
picter
to
reflect
that
she
s
no
longer
equal
to
fully
understanding
the
honor
may
i
saw
he
was
about
to
come
at
me
again
and
i
stopped
him
we
ll
drink
her
health
said
i
ah
cried
mr
pumblechook
leaning
back
in
his
chair
quite
flaccid
with
admiration
that
s
the
way
you
know
em
sir
i
don
t
know
who
sir
was
but
he
certainly
was
not
i
and
there
was
no
third
person
present
that
s
the
way
you
know
the
noble
minded
sir
ever
forgiving
and
ever
affable
it
might
said
the
servile
pumblechook
putting
down
his
untasted
glass
in
a
hurry
and
getting
up
again
to
a
common
person
have
the
appearance
of
repeating
but
may
i
when
he
had
done
it
he
resumed
his
seat
and
drank
to
my
sister
let
us
never
be
blind
said
mr
pumblechook
to
her
faults
of
temper
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
she
meant
well
at
about
this
time
i
began
to
observe
that
he
was
getting
flushed
in
the
face
as
to
myself
i
felt
all
face
steeped
in
wine
and
smarting
i
mentioned
to
mr
pumblechook
that
i
wished
to
have
my
new
clothes
sent
to
his
house
and
he
was
ecstatic
on
my
so
distinguishing
him
i
mentioned
my
reason
for
desiring
to
avoid
observation
in
the
village
and
he
lauded
it
to
the
skies
there
was
nobody
but
himself
he
intimated
worthy
of
my
confidence
and
in
short
might
he
then
he
asked
me
tenderly
if
i
remembered
our
boyish
games
at
sums
and
how
we
had
gone
together
to
have
me
bound
apprentice
and
in
effect
how
he
had
ever
been
my
favorite
fancy
and
my
chosen
friend
if
i
had
taken
ten
times
as
many
glasses
of
wine
as
i
had
i
should
have
known
that
he
never
had
stood
in
that
relation
towards
me
and
should
in
my
heart
of
hearts
have
repudiated
the
idea
yet
for
all
that
i
remember
feeling
convinced
that
i
had
been
much
mistaken
in
him
and
that
he
was
a
sensible
practical
good
hearted
prime
fellow
by
degrees
he
fell
to
reposing
such
great
confidence
in
me
as
to
ask
my
advice
in
reference
to
his
own
affairs
he
mentioned
that
there
was
an
opportunity
for
a
great
amalgamation
and
monopoly
of
the
corn
and
seed
trade
on
those
premises
if
enlarged
such
as
had
never
occurred
before
in
that
or
any
other
neighborhood
what
alone
was
wanting
to
the
realization
of
a
vast
fortune
he
considered
to
be
more
capital
those
were
the
two
little
words
more
capital
now
it
appeared
to
him
pumblechook
that
if
that
capital
were
got
into
the
business
through
a
sleeping
partner
sir
which
sleeping
partner
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
walk
in
by
self
or
deputy
whenever
he
pleased
and
examine
the
books
and
walk
in
twice
a
year
and
take
his
profits
away
in
his
pocket
to
the
tune
of
fifty
per
cent
it
appeared
to
him
that
that
might
be
an
opening
for
a
young
gentleman
of
spirit
combined
with
property
which
would
be
worthy
of
his
attention
but
what
did
i
think
he
had
great
confidence
in
my
opinion
and
what
did
i
think
i
gave
it
as
my
opinion
wait
a
bit
the
united
vastness
and
distinctness
of
this
view
so
struck
him
that
he
no
longer
asked
if
he
might
shake
hands
with
me
but
said
he
really
must
and
did
we
drank
all
the
wine
and
mr
pumblechook
pledged
himself
over
and
over
again
to
keep
joseph
up
to
the
mark
i
don
t
know
what
mark
and
to
render
me
efficient
and
constant
service
i
don
t
know
what
service
he
also
made
known
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
certainly
after
having
kept
his
secret
wonderfully
well
that
he
had
always
said
of
me
that
boy
is
no
common
boy
and
mark
me
his
fortun
will
be
no
common
fortun
he
said
with
a
tearful
smile
that
it
was
a
singular
thing
to
think
of
now
and
i
said
so
too
finally
i
went
out
into
the
air
with
a
dim
perception
that
there
was
something
unwonted
in
the
conduct
of
the
sunshine
and
found
that
i
had
slumberously
got
to
the
turnpike
without
having
taken
any
account
of
the
road
there
i
was
roused
by
mr
pumblechook
s
hailing
me
he
was
a
long
way
down
the
sunny
street
and
was
making
expressive
gestures
for
me
to
stop
i
stopped
and
he
came
up
breathless
no
my
dear
friend
said
he
when
he
had
recovered
wind
for
speech
not
if
i
can
help
it
this
occasion
shall
not
entirely
pass
without
that
affability
on
your
part
may
i
as
an
old
friend
and
well
wisher
may
i
we
shook
hands
for
the
hundredth
time
at
least
and
he
ordered
a
young
carter
out
of
my
way
with
the
greatest
indignation
then
he
blessed
me
and
stood
waving
his
hand
to
me
until
i
had
passed
the
crook
in
the
road
and
then
i
turned
into
a
field
and
had
a
long
nap
under
a
hedge
before
i
pursued
my
way
home
i
had
scant
luggage
to
take
with
me
to
london
for
little
of
the
little
i
possessed
was
adapted
to
my
new
station
but
i
began
packing
that
same
afternoon
and
wildly
packed
up
things
that
i
knew
i
should
want
next
morning
in
a
fiction
that
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
so
tuesday
wednesday
and
thursday
passed
and
on
friday
morning
i
went
to
mr
pumblechook
s
to
put
on
my
new
clothes
and
pay
my
visit
to
miss
havisham
mr
pumblechook
s
own
room
was
given
up
to
me
to
dress
in
and
was
decorated
with
clean
towels
expressly
for
the
event
my
clothes
were
rather
a
disappointment
of
course
probably
every
new
and
eagerly
expected
garment
ever
put
on
since
clothes
came
in
fell
a
trifle
short
of
the
wearer
s
expectation
but
after
i
had
had
my
new
suit
on
some
half
an
hour
and
had
gone
through
an
immensity
of
posturing
with
mr
pumblechook
s
very
limited
dressing
glass
in
the
futile
endeavor
to
see
my
legs
it
seemed
to
fit
me
better
it
being
market
morning
at
a
neighboring
town
some
ten
miles
off
mr
pumblechook
was
not
at
home
i
had
not
told
him
exactly
when
i
meant
to
leave
and
was
not
likely
to
shake
hands
with
him
again
before
departing
this
was
all
as
it
should
be
and
i
went
out
in
my
new
array
fearfully
ashamed
of
having
to
pass
the
shopman
and
suspicious
after
all
that
i
was
at
a
personal
disadvantage
something
like
joe
s
in
his
sunday
suit
i
went
circuitously
to
miss
havisham
s
by
all
the
back
ways
and
rang
at
the
bell
constrainedly
on
account
of
the
stiff
long
fingers
of
my
gloves
sarah
pocket
came
to
the
gate
and
positively
reeled
back
when
she
saw
me
so
changed
her
walnut
shell
countenance
likewise
turned
from
brown
to
green
and
yellow
you
said
she
you
good
gracious
what
do
you
want
i
am
going
to
london
miss
pocket
said
i
and
want
to
say
good
by
to
miss
havisham
i
was
not
expected
for
she
left
me
locked
in
the
yard
while
she
went
to
ask
if
i
were
to
be
admitted
after
a
very
short
delay
she
returned
and
took
me
up
staring
at
me
all
the
way
miss
havisham
was
taking
exercise
in
the
room
with
the
long
spread
table
leaning
on
her
crutch
stick
the
room
was
lighted
as
of
yore
and
at
the
sound
of
our
entrance
she
stopped
and
turned
she
was
then
just
abreast
of
the
rotted
bride
cake
don
t
go
sarah
she
said
well
pip
i
start
for
london
miss
havisham
to
morrow
i
was
exceedingly
careful
what
i
said
and
i
thought
you
would
kindly
not
mind
my
taking
leave
of
you
this
is
a
gay
figure
pip
said
she
making
her
crutch
stick
play
round
me
as
if
she
the
fairy
godmother
who
had
changed
me
were
bestowing
the
finishing
gift
i
have
come
into
such
good
fortune
since
i
saw
you
last
miss
havisham
i
murmured
and
i
am
so
grateful
for
it
miss
havisham
ay
ay
said
she
looking
at
the
discomfited
and
envious
sarah
with
delight
i
have
seen
mr
jaggers
i
have
heard
about
it
pip
so
you
go
to
morrow
yes
miss
havisham
and
you
are
adopted
by
a
rich
person
yes
miss
havisham
not
named
no
miss
havisham
and
mr
jaggers
is
made
your
guardian
yes
miss
havisham
she
quite
gloated
on
these
questions
and
answers
so
keen
was
her
enjoyment
of
sarah
pocket
s
jealous
dismay
well
she
went
on
you
have
a
promising
career
before
you
be
good
deserve
it
and
abide
by
mr
jaggers
s
instructions
she
looked
at
me
and
looked
at
sarah
and
sarah
s
countenance
wrung
out
of
her
watchful
face
a
cruel
smile
good
by
pip
you
will
always
keep
the
name
of
pip
you
know
yes
miss
havisham
good
by
pip
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
i
went
down
on
my
knee
and
put
it
to
my
lips
i
had
not
considered
how
i
should
take
leave
of
her
it
came
naturally
to
me
at
the
moment
to
do
this
she
looked
at
sarah
pocket
with
triumph
in
her
weird
eyes
and
so
i
left
my
fairy
godmother
with
both
her
hands
on
her
crutch
stick
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
dimly
lighted
room
beside
the
rotten
bride
cake
that
was
hidden
in
cobwebs
sarah
pocket
conducted
me
down
as
if
i
were
a
ghost
who
must
be
seen
out
she
could
not
get
over
my
appearance
and
was
in
the
last
degree
confounded
i
said
good
by
miss
pocket
but
she
merely
stared
and
did
not
seem
collected
enough
to
know
that
i
had
spoken
clear
of
the
house
i
made
the
best
of
my
way
back
to
pumblechook
s
took
off
my
new
clothes
made
them
into
a
bundle
and
went
back
home
in
my
older
dress
carrying
it
to
speak
the
truth
much
more
at
my
ease
too
though
i
had
the
bundle
to
carry
and
now
those
six
days
which
were
to
have
run
out
so
slowly
had
run
out
fast
and
were
gone
and
to
morrow
looked
me
in
the
face
more
steadily
than
i
could
look
at
it
as
the
six
evenings
had
dwindled
away
to
five
to
four
to
three
to
two
i
had
become
more
and
more
appreciative
of
the
society
of
joe
and
biddy
on
this
last
evening
i
dressed
my
self
out
in
my
new
clothes
for
their
delight
and
sat
in
my
splendor
until
bedtime
we
had
a
hot
supper
on
the
occasion
graced
by
the
inevitable
roast
fowl
and
we
had
some
flip
to
finish
with
we
were
all
very
low
and
none
the
higher
for
pretending
to
be
in
spirits
i
was
to
leave
our
village
at
five
in
the
morning
carrying
my
little
hand
portmanteau
and
i
had
told
joe
that
i
wished
to
walk
away
all
alone
i
am
afraid
sore
afraid
that
this
purpose
originated
in
my
sense
of
the
contrast
there
would
be
between
me
and
joe
if
we
went
to
the
coach
together
i
had
pretended
with
myself
that
there
was
nothing
of
this
taint
in
the
arrangement
but
when
i
went
up
to
my
little
room
on
this
last
night
i
felt
compelled
to
admit
that
it
might
be
so
and
had
an
impulse
upon
me
to
go
down
again
and
entreat
joe
to
walk
with
me
in
the
morning
i
did
not
all
night
there
were
coaches
in
my
broken
sleep
going
to
wrong
places
instead
of
to
london
and
having
in
the
traces
now
dogs
now
cats
now
pigs
now
men
never
horses
fantastic
failures
of
journeys
occupied
me
until
the
day
dawned
and
the
birds
were
singing
then
i
got
up
and
partly
dressed
and
sat
at
the
window
to
take
a
last
look
out
and
in
taking
it
fell
asleep
biddy
was
astir
so
early
to
get
my
breakfast
that
although
i
did
not
sleep
at
the
window
an
hour
i
smelt
the
smoke
of
the
kitchen
fire
when
i
started
up
with
a
terrible
idea
that
it
must
be
late
in
the
afternoon
but
long
after
that
and
long
after
i
had
heard
the
clinking
of
the
teacups
and
was
quite
ready
i
wanted
the
resolution
to
go
down
stairs
after
all
i
remained
up
there
repeatedly
unlocking
and
unstrapping
my
small
portmanteau
and
locking
and
strapping
it
up
again
until
biddy
called
to
me
that
i
was
late
it
was
a
hurried
breakfast
with
no
taste
in
it
i
got
up
from
the
meal
saying
with
a
sort
of
briskness
as
if
it
had
only
just
occurred
to
me
well
i
suppose
i
must
be
off
and
then
i
kissed
my
sister
who
was
laughing
and
nodding
and
shaking
in
her
usual
chair
and
kissed
biddy
and
threw
my
arms
around
joe
s
neck
then
i
took
up
my
little
portmanteau
and
walked
out
the
last
i
saw
of
them
was
when
i
presently
heard
a
scuffle
behind
me
and
looking
back
saw
joe
throwing
an
old
shoe
after
me
and
biddy
throwing
another
old
shoe
i
stopped
then
to
wave
my
hat
and
dear
old
joe
waved
his
strong
right
arm
above
his
head
crying
huskily
hooroar
and
biddy
put
her
apron
to
her
face
i
walked
away
at
a
good
pace
thinking
it
was
easier
to
go
than
i
had
supposed
it
would
be
and
reflecting
that
it
would
never
have
done
to
have
had
an
old
shoe
thrown
after
the
coach
in
sight
of
all
the
high
street
i
whistled
and
made
nothing
of
going
but
the
village
was
very
peaceful
and
quiet
and
the
light
mists
were
solemnly
rising
as
if
to
show
me
the
world
and
i
had
been
so
innocent
and
little
there
and
all
beyond
was
so
unknown
and
great
that
in
a
moment
with
a
strong
heave
and
sob
i
broke
into
tears
it
was
by
the
finger
post
at
the
end
of
the
village
and
i
laid
my
hand
upon
it
and
said
good
by
o
my
dear
dear
friend
heaven
knows
we
need
never
be
ashamed
of
our
tears
for
they
are
rain
upon
the
blinding
dust
of
earth
overlying
our
hard
hearts
i
was
better
after
i
had
cried
than
before
more
sorry
more
aware
of
my
own
ingratitude
more
gentle
if
i
had
cried
before
i
should
have
had
joe
with
me
then
so
subdued
i
was
by
those
tears
and
by
their
breaking
out
again
in
the
course
of
the
quiet
walk
that
when
i
was
on
the
coach
and
it
was
clear
of
the
town
i
deliberated
with
an
aching
heart
whether
i
would
not
get
down
when
we
changed
horses
and
walk
back
and
have
another
evening
at
home
and
a
better
parting
we
changed
and
i
had
not
made
up
my
mind
and
still
reflected
for
my
comfort
that
it
would
be
quite
practicable
to
get
down
and
walk
back
when
we
changed
again
and
while
i
was
occupied
with
these
deliberations
i
would
fancy
an
exact
resemblance
to
joe
in
some
man
coming
along
the
road
towards
us
and
my
heart
would
beat
high
as
if
he
could
possibly
be
there
we
changed
again
and
yet
again
and
it
was
now
too
late
and
too
far
to
go
back
and
i
went
on
and
the
mists
had
all
solemnly
risen
now
and
the
world
lay
spread
before
me
this
is
the
end
of
the
first
stage
of
pip
s
expectations
chapter
xx
the
journey
from
our
town
to
the
metropolis
was
a
journey
of
about
five
hours
it
was
a
little
past
midday
when
the
four
horse
stage
coach
by
which
i
was
a
passenger
got
into
the
ravel
of
traffic
frayed
out
about
the
cross
keys
wood
street
cheapside
london
we
britons
had
at
that
time
particularly
settled
that
it
was
treasonable
to
doubt
our
having
and
our
being
the
best
of
everything
otherwise
while
i
was
scared
by
the
immensity
of
london
i
think
i
might
have
had
some
faint
doubts
whether
it
was
not
rather
ugly
crooked
narrow
and
dirty
mr
jaggers
had
duly
sent
me
his
address
it
was
little
britain
and
he
had
written
after
it
on
his
card
just
out
of
smithfield
and
close
by
the
coach
office
nevertheless
a
hackney
coachman
who
seemed
to
have
as
many
capes
to
his
greasy
great
coat
as
he
was
years
old
packed
me
up
in
his
coach
and
hemmed
me
in
with
a
folding
and
jingling
barrier
of
steps
as
if
he
were
going
to
take
me
fifty
miles
his
getting
on
his
box
which
i
remember
to
have
been
decorated
with
an
old
weather
stained
pea
green
hammercloth
moth
eaten
into
rags
was
quite
a
work
of
time
it
was
a
wonderful
equipage
with
six
great
coronets
outside
and
ragged
things
behind
for
i
don
t
know
how
many
footmen
to
hold
on
by
and
a
harrow
below
them
to
prevent
amateur
footmen
from
yielding
to
the
temptation
i
had
scarcely
had
time
to
enjoy
the
coach
and
to
think
how
like
a
straw
yard
it
was
and
yet
how
like
a
rag
shop
and
to
wonder
why
the
horses
nose
bags
were
kept
inside
when
i
observed
the
coachman
beginning
to
get
down
as
if
we
were
going
to
stop
presently
and
stop
we
presently
did
in
a
gloomy
street
at
certain
offices
with
an
open
door
whereon
was
painted
mr
jaggers
how
much
i
asked
the
coachman
the
coachman
answered
a
shilling
unless
you
wish
to
make
it
more
i
naturally
said
i
had
no
wish
to
make
it
more
then
it
must
be
a
shilling
observed
the
coachman
i
don
t
want
to
get
into
trouble
i
know
him
he
darkly
closed
an
eye
at
mr
jaggers
s
name
and
shook
his
head
when
he
had
got
his
shilling
and
had
in
course
of
time
completed
the
ascent
to
his
box
and
had
got
away
which
appeared
to
relieve
his
mind
i
went
into
the
front
office
with
my
little
portmanteau
in
my
hand
and
asked
was
mr
jaggers
at
home
he
is
not
returned
the
clerk
he
is
in
court
at
present
am
i
addressing
mr
pip
i
signified
that
he
was
addressing
mr
pip
mr
jaggers
left
word
would
you
wait
in
his
room
he
couldn
t
say
how
long
he
might
be
having
a
case
on
but
it
stands
to
reason
his
time
being
valuable
that
he
won
t
be
longer
than
he
can
help
with
those
words
the
clerk
opened
a
door
and
ushered
me
into
an
inner
chamber
at
the
back
here
we
found
a
gentleman
with
one
eye
in
a
velveteen
suit
and
knee
breeches
who
wiped
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
on
being
interrupted
in
the
perusal
of
the
newspaper
go
and
wait
outside
mike
said
the
clerk
i
began
to
say
that
i
hoped
i
was
not
interrupting
when
the
clerk
shoved
this
gentleman
out
with
as
little
ceremony
as
i
ever
saw
used
and
tossing
his
fur
cap
out
after
him
left
me
alone
mr
jaggers
s
room
was
lighted
by
a
skylight
only
and
was
a
most
dismal
place
the
skylight
eccentrically
pitched
like
a
broken
head
and
the
distorted
adjoining
houses
looking
as
if
they
had
twisted
themselves
to
peep
down
at
me
through
it
there
were
not
so
many
papers
about
as
i
should
have
expected
to
see
and
there
were
some
odd
objects
about
that
i
should
not
have
expected
to
see
such
as
an
old
rusty
pistol
a
sword
in
a
scabbard
several
strange
looking
boxes
and
packages
and
two
dreadful
casts
on
a
shelf
of
faces
peculiarly
swollen
and
twitchy
about
the
nose
mr
jaggers
s
own
high
backed
chair
was
of
deadly
black
horsehair
with
rows
of
brass
nails
round
it
like
a
coffin
and
i
fancied
i
could
see
how
he
leaned
back
in
it
and
bit
his
forefinger
at
the
clients
the
room
was
but
small
and
the
clients
seemed
to
have
had
a
habit
of
backing
up
against
the
wall
the
wall
especially
opposite
to
mr
jaggers
s
chair
being
greasy
with
shoulders
i
recalled
too
that
the
one
eyed
gentleman
had
shuffled
forth
against
the
wall
when
i
was
the
innocent
cause
of
his
being
turned
out
i
sat
down
in
the
cliental
chair
placed
over
against
mr
jaggers
s
chair
and
became
fascinated
by
the
dismal
atmosphere
of
the
place
i
called
to
mind
that
the
clerk
had
the
same
air
of
knowing
something
to
everybody
else
s
disadvantage
as
his
master
had
i
wondered
how
many
other
clerks
there
were
up
stairs
and
whether
they
all
claimed
to
have
the
same
detrimental
mastery
of
their
fellow
creatures
i
wondered
what
was
the
history
of
all
the
odd
litter
about
the
room
and
how
it
came
there
i
wondered
whether
the
two
swollen
faces
were
of
mr
jaggers
s
family
and
if
he
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
had
a
pair
of
such
ill
looking
relations
why
he
stuck
them
on
that
dusty
perch
for
the
blacks
and
flies
to
settle
on
instead
of
giving
them
a
place
at
home
of
course
i
had
no
experience
of
a
london
summer
day
and
my
spirits
may
have
been
oppressed
by
the
hot
exhausted
air
and
by
the
dust
and
grit
that
lay
thick
on
everything
but
i
sat
wondering
and
waiting
in
mr
jaggers
s
close
room
until
i
really
could
not
bear
the
two
casts
on
the
shelf
above
mr
jaggers
s
chair
and
got
up
and
went
out
when
i
told
the
clerk
that
i
would
take
a
turn
in
the
air
while
i
waited
he
advised
me
to
go
round
the
corner
and
i
should
come
into
smithfield
so
i
came
into
smithfield
and
the
shameful
place
being
all
asmear
with
filth
and
fat
and
blood
and
foam
seemed
to
stick
to
me
so
i
rubbed
it
off
with
all
possible
speed
by
turning
into
a
street
where
i
saw
the
great
black
dome
of
saint
paul
s
bulging
at
me
from
behind
a
grim
stone
building
which
a
bystander
said
was
newgate
prison
following
the
wall
of
the
jail
i
found
the
roadway
covered
with
straw
to
deaden
the
noise
of
passing
vehicles
and
from
this
and
from
the
quantity
of
people
standing
about
smelling
strongly
of
spirits
and
beer
i
inferred
that
the
trials
were
on
while
i
looked
about
me
here
an
exceedingly
dirty
and
partially
drunk
minister
of
justice
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
step
in
and
hear
a
trial
or
so
informing
me
that
he
could
give
me
a
front
place
for
half
a
crown
whence
i
should
command
a
full
view
of
the
lord
chief
justice
in
his
wig
and
robes
mentioning
that
awful
personage
like
waxwork
and
presently
offering
him
at
the
reduced
price
of
eighteen
pence
as
i
declined
the
proposal
on
the
plea
of
an
appointment
he
was
so
good
as
to
take
me
into
a
yard
and
show
me
where
the
gallows
was
kept
and
also
where
people
were
publicly
whipped
and
then
he
showed
me
the
debtors
door
out
of
which
culprits
came
to
be
hanged
heightening
the
interest
of
that
dreadful
portal
by
giving
me
to
understand
that
four
on
em
would
come
out
at
that
door
the
day
after
to
morrow
at
eight
in
the
morning
to
be
killed
in
a
row
this
was
horrible
and
gave
me
a
sickening
idea
of
london
the
more
so
as
the
lord
chief
justice
s
proprietor
wore
from
his
hat
down
to
his
boots
and
up
again
to
his
pocket
handkerchief
inclusive
mildewed
clothes
which
had
evidently
not
belonged
to
him
originally
and
which
i
took
it
into
my
head
he
had
bought
cheap
of
the
executioner
under
these
circumstances
i
thought
myself
well
rid
of
him
for
a
shilling
i
dropped
into
the
office
to
ask
if
mr
jaggers
had
come
in
yet
and
i
found
he
had
not
and
i
strolled
out
again
this
time
i
made
the
tour
of
little
britain
and
turned
into
bartholomew
close
and
now
i
became
aware
that
other
people
were
waiting
about
for
mr
jaggers
as
well
as
i
there
were
two
men
of
secret
appearance
lounging
in
bartholomew
close
and
thoughtfully
fitting
their
feet
into
the
cracks
of
the
pavement
as
they
talked
together
one
of
whom
said
to
the
other
when
they
first
passed
me
that
jaggers
would
do
it
if
it
was
to
be
done
there
was
a
knot
of
three
men
and
two
women
standing
at
a
corner
and
one
of
the
women
was
crying
on
her
dirty
shawl
and
the
other
comforted
her
by
saying
as
she
pulled
her
own
shawl
over
her
shoulders
jaggers
is
for
him
melia
and
what
more
could
you
have
there
was
a
red
eyed
little
jew
who
came
into
the
close
while
i
was
loitering
there
in
company
with
a
second
little
jew
whom
he
sent
upon
an
errand
and
while
the
messenger
was
gone
i
remarked
this
jew
who
was
of
a
highly
excitable
temperament
performing
a
jig
of
anxiety
under
a
lamp
post
and
accompanying
himself
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
with
the
words
o
jaggerth
jaggerth
jaggerth
all
otherth
ith
cag
maggerth
give
me
jaggerth
these
testimonies
to
the
popularity
of
my
guardian
made
a
deep
impression
on
me
and
i
admired
and
wondered
more
than
ever
at
length
as
i
was
looking
out
at
the
iron
gate
of
bartholomew
close
into
little
britain
i
saw
mr
jaggers
coming
across
the
road
towards
me
all
the
others
who
were
waiting
saw
him
at
the
same
time
and
there
was
quite
a
rush
at
him
mr
jaggers
putting
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
walking
me
on
at
his
side
without
saying
anything
to
me
addressed
himself
to
his
followers
first
he
took
the
two
secret
men
now
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
said
mr
jaggers
throwing
his
finger
at
them
i
want
to
know
no
more
than
i
know
as
to
the
result
it
s
a
toss
up
i
told
you
from
the
first
it
was
a
toss
up
have
you
paid
wemmick
we
made
the
money
up
this
morning
sir
said
one
of
the
men
submissively
while
the
other
perused
mr
jaggers
s
face
i
don
t
ask
you
when
you
made
it
up
or
where
or
whether
you
made
it
up
at
all
has
wemmick
got
it
