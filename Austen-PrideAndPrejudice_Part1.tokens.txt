chapter

it
is
a
truth
universally
acknowledged
that
a
single
man
in
possession
of
a
good
fortune
must
be
in
want
of
a
wife
however
little
known
the
feelings
or
views
of
such
a
man
may
be
on
his
first
entering
a
neighbourhood
this
truth
is
so
well
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
surrounding
families
that
he
is
considered
the
rightful
property
of
some
one
or
other
of
their
daughters
my
dear
mr
bennet
said
his
lady
to
him
one
day
have
you
heard
that
netherfield
park
is
let
at
last
mr
bennet
replied
that
he
had
not
but
it
is
returned
she
for
mrs
long
has
just
been
here
and
she
told
me
all
about
it
mr
bennet
made
no
answer
do
you
not
want
to
know
who
has
taken
it
cried
his
wife
impatiently
you
want
to
tell
me
and
i
have
no
objection
to
hearing
it
this
was
invitation
enough
why
my
dear
you
must
know
mrs
long
says
that
netherfield
is
taken
by
a
young
man
of
large
fortune
from
the
north
of
england
that
he
came
down
on
monday
in
a
chaise
and
four
to
see
the
place
and
was
so
much
delighted
with
it
that
he
agreed
with
mr
morris
immediately
that
he
is
to
take
possession
before
michaelmas
and
some
of
his
servants
are
to
be
in
the
house
by
the
end
of
next
week
what
is
his
name
bingley
is
he
married
or
single
oh
single
my
dear
to
be
sure
a
single
man
of
large
fortune
four
or
five
thousand
a
year
what
a
fine
thing
for
our
girls
how
so
how
can
it
affect
them
my
dear
mr
bennet
replied
his
wife
how
can
you
be
so
tiresome
you
must
know
that
i
am
thinking
of
his
marrying
one
of
them
is
that
his
design
in
settling
here
design
nonsense
how
can
you
talk
so
but
it
is
very
likely
that
he
may
fall
in
love
with
one
of
them
and
therefore
you
must
visit
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
i
see
no
occasion
for
that
you
and
the
girls
may
go
or
you
may
send
them
by
themselves
which
perhaps
will
be
still
better
for
as
you
are
as
handsome
as
any
of
them
mr
bingley
may
like
you
the
best
of
the
party
my
dear
you
flatter
me
i
certainly
have
had
my
share
of
beauty
but
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
anything
extraordinary
now
when
a
woman
has
five
grown
up
daughters
she
ought
to
give
over
thinking
of
her
own
beauty
in
such
cases
a
woman
has
not
often
much
beauty
to
think
of
but
my
dear
you
must
indeed
go
and
see
mr
bingley
when
he
comes
into
the
neighbourhood
it
is
more
than
i
engage
for
i
assure
you
but
consider
your
daughters
only
think
what
an
establishment
it
would
be
for
one
of
them
sir
william
and
lady
lucas
are
determined
to
go
merely
on
that
account
for
in
general
you
know
they
visit
no
newcomers
indeed
you
must
go
for
it
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
visit
him
if
you
do
not
you
are
over
scrupulous
surely
i
dare
say
mr
bingley
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
and
i
will
send
a
few
lines
by
you
to
assure
him
of
my
hearty
consent
to
his
marrying
whichever
he
chooses
of
the
girls
though
i
must
throw
in
a
good
word
for
my
little
lizzy
i
desire
you
will
do
no
such
thing
lizzy
is
not
a
bit
better
than
the
others
and
i
am
sure
she
is
not
half
so
handsome
as
jane
nor
half
so
good
humoured
as
lydia
but
you
are
always
giving
her
the
preference
they
have
none
of
them
much
to
recommend
them
replied
he
they
are
all
silly
and
ignorant
like
other
girls
but
lizzy
has
something
more
of
quickness
than
her
sisters
mr
bennet
how
can
you
abuse
your
own
children
in
such
a
way
you
take
delight
in
vexing
me
you
have
no
compassion
for
my
poor
nerves
you
mistake
me
my
dear
i
have
a
high
respect
for
your
nerves
they
are
my
old
friends
i
have
heard
you
mention
them
with
consideration
these
last
twenty
years
at
least
ah
you
do
not
know
what
i
suffer
but
i
hope
you
will
get
over
it
and
live
to
see
many
young
men
of
four
thousand
a
year
come
into
the
neighbourhood
it
will
be
no
use
to
us
if
twenty
such
should
come
since
you
will
not
visit
them
depend
upon
it
my
dear
that
when
there
are
twenty
i
will
visit
them
all
mr
bennet
was
so
odd
a
mixture
of
quick
parts
sarcastic
humour
reserve
and
caprice
that
the
experience
of
three
and
twenty
years
had
been
insufficient
to
make
his
wife
understand
his
character
her
mind
was
less
difficult
to
develop
she
was
a
woman
of
mean
understanding
little
information
and
uncertain
temper
when
she
was
discontented
she
fancied
herself
nervous
the
business
of
her
life
was
to
get
her
daughters
married
its
solace
was
visiting
and
news
chapter
2
mr
bennet
was
among
the
earliest
of
those
who
waited
on
mr
bingley
he
had
always
intended
to
visit
him
though
to
the
last
always
assuring
his
wife
that
he
should
not
go
and
till
the
evening
after
the
visit
was
paid
she
had
no
knowledge
of
it
it
was
then
disclosed
in
the
following
manner
observing
his
second
daughter
employed
in
trimming
a
hat
he
suddenly
addressed
her
with
i
hope
mr
bingley
will
like
it
lizzy
we
are
not
in
a
way
to
know
what
mr
bingley
likes
said
her
mother
resentfully
since
we
are
not
to
visit
but
you
forget
mamma
said
elizabeth
that
we
shall
meet
him
at
the
assemblies
and
that
mrs
long
promised
to
introduce
him
i
do
not
believe
mrs
long
will
do
any
such
thing
she
has
two
nieces
of
her
own
she
is
a
selfish
hypocritical
woman
and
i
have
no
opinion
of
her
no
more
have
i
said
mr
bennet
and
i
am
glad
to
find
that
you
do
not
depend
on
her
serving
you
mrs
bennet
deigned
not
to
make
any
reply
but
unable
to
contain
herself
began
scolding
one
of
her
daughters
don
t
keep
coughing
so
kitty
for
heaven
s
sake
have
a
little
compassion
on
my
nerves
you
tear
them
to
pieces
kitty
has
no
discretion
in
her
coughs
said
her
father
she
times
them
ill
i
do
not
cough
for
my
own
amusement
replied
kitty
fretfully
when
is
your
next
ball
to
be
lizzy
to
morrow
fortnight
aye
so
it
is
cried
her
mother
and
mrs
long
does
not
come
back
till
the
day
before
so
it
will
be
impossible
for
her
to
introduce
him
for
she
will
not
know
him
herself
then
my
dear
you
may
have
the
advantage
of
your
friend
and
introduce
mr
bingley
to
her
impossible
mr
bennet
impossible
when
i
am
not
acquainted
with
him
myself
how
can
you
be
so
teasing
i
honour
your
circumspection
a
fortnight
s
acquaintance
is
certainly
very
little
one
cannot
know
what
a
man
really
is
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
but
if
we
do
not
venture
somebody
else
will
and
after
all
mrs
long
and
her
daughters
must
stand
their
chance
and
therefore
as
she
will
think
it
an
act
of
kindness
if
you
decline
the
office
i
will
take
it
on
myself
the
girls
stared
at
their
father
mrs
bennet
said
only
nonsense
nonsense
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
that
emphatic
exclamation
cried
he
do
you
consider
the
forms
of
introduction
and
the
stress
that
is
laid
on
them
as
nonsense
i
cannot
quite
agree
with
you
there
what
say
you
mary
for
you
are
a
young
lady
of
deep
reflection
i
know
and
read
great
books
and
make
extracts
mary
wished
to
say
something
sensible
but
knew
not
how
while
mary
is
adjusting
her
ideas
he
continued
let
us
return
to
mr
bingley
i
am
sick
of
mr
bingley
cried
his
wife
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
but
why
did
not
you
tell
me
that
before
if
i
had
known
as
much
this
morning
i
certainly
would
not
have
called
on
him
it
is
very
unlucky
but
as
i
have
actually
paid
the
visit
we
cannot
escape
the
acquaintance
now
the
astonishment
of
the
ladies
was
just
what
he
wished
that
of
mrs
bennet
perhaps
surpassing
the
rest
though
when
the
first
tumult
of
joy
was
over
she
began
to
declare
that
it
was
what
she
had
expected
all
the
while
how
good
it
was
in
you
my
dear
mr
bennet
but
i
knew
i
should
persuade
you
at
last
i
was
sure
you
loved
your
girls
too
well
to
neglect
such
an
acquaintance
well
how
pleased
i
am
and
it
is
such
a
good
joke
too
that
you
should
have
gone
this
morning
and
never
said
a
word
about
it
till
now
now
kitty
you
may
cough
as
much
as
you
choose
said
mr
bennet
and
as
he
spoke
he
left
the
room
fatigued
with
the
raptures
of
his
wife
what
an
excellent
father
you
have
girls
said
she
when
the
door
was
shut
i
do
not
know
how
you
will
ever
make
him
amends
for
his
kindness
or
me
either
for
that
matter
at
our
time
of
life
it
is
not
so
pleasant
i
can
tell
you
to
be
making
new
acquaintances
every
day
but
for
your
sakes
we
would
do
anything
lydia
my
love
though
you
are
the
youngest
i
dare
say
mr
bingley
will
dance
with
you
at
the
next
ball
oh
said
lydia
stoutly
i
am
not
afraid
for
though
i
am
the
youngest
i
m
the
tallest
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
conjecturing
how
soon
he
would
return
mr
bennet
s
visit
and
determining
when
they
should
ask
him
to
dinner
chapter
3
not
all
that
mrs
bennet
however
with
the
assistance
of
her
five
daughters
could
ask
on
the
subject
was
sufficient
to
draw
from
her
husband
any
satisfactory
description
of
mr
bingley
they
attacked
him
in
various
ways
with
barefaced
questions
ingenious
suppositions
and
distant
surmises
but
he
eluded
the
skill
of
them
all
and
they
were
at
last
obliged
to
accept
the
second
hand
intelligence
of
their
neighbour
lady
lucas
her
report
was
highly
favourable
sir
william
had
been
delighted
with
him
he
was
quite
young
wonderfully
handsome
extremely
agreeable
and
to
crown
the
whole
he
meant
to
be
at
the
next
assembly
with
a
large
party
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
to
be
fond
of
dancing
was
a
certain
step
towards
falling
in
love
and
very
lively
hopes
of
mr
bingley
s
heart
were
entertained
if
i
can
but
see
one
of
my
daughters
happily
settled
at
netherfield
said
mrs
bennet
to
her
husband
and
all
the
others
equally
well
married
i
shall
have
nothing
to
wish
for
in
a
few
days
mr
bingley
returned
mr
bennet
s
visit
and
sat
about
ten
minutes
with
him
in
his
library
he
had
entertained
hopes
of
being
admitted
to
a
sight
of
the
young
ladies
of
whose
beauty
he
had
heard
much
but
he
saw
only
the
father
the
ladies
were
somewhat
more
fortunate
for
they
had
the
advantage
of
ascertaining
from
an
upper
window
that
he
wore
a
blue
coat
and
rode
a
black
horse
an
invitation
to
dinner
was
soon
afterwards
dispatched
and
already
had
mrs
bennet
planned
the
courses
that
were
to
do
credit
to
her
housekeeping
when
an
answer
arrived
which
deferred
it
all
mr
bingley
was
obliged
to
be
in
town
the
following
day
and
consequently
unable
to
accept
the
honour
of
their
invitation
etc
mrs
bennet
was
quite
disconcerted
she
could
not
imagine
what
business
he
could
have
in
town
so
soon
after
his
arrival
in
hertfordshire
and
she
began
to
fear
that
he
might
be
always
flying
about
from
one
place
to
another
and
never
settled
at
netherfield
as
he
ought
to
be
lady
lucas
quieted
her
fears
a
little
by
starting
the
idea
of
his
being
gone
to
london
only
to
get
a
large
party
for
the
ball
and
a
report
soon
followed
that
mr
bingley
was
to
bring
twelve
ladies
and
seven
gentlemen
with
him
to
the
assembly
the
girls
grieved
over
such
a
number
of
ladies
but
were
comforted
the
day
before
the
ball
by
hearing
that
instead
of
twelve
he
brought
only
six
with
him
from
london
his
five
sisters
and
a
cousin
and
when
the
party
entered
the
assembly
room
it
consisted
of
only
five
altogether
mr
bingley
his
two
sisters
the
husband
of
the
eldest
and
another
young
man
mr
bingley
was
good
looking
and
gentlemanlike
he
had
a
pleasant
countenance
and
easy
unaffected
manners
his
sisters
were
fine
women
with
an
air
of
decided
fashion
his
brother
in
law
mr
hurst
merely
looked
the
gentleman
but
his
friend
mr
darcy
soon
drew
the
attention
of
the
room
by
his
fine
tall
person
handsome
features
noble
mien
and
the
report
which
was
in
general
circulation
within
five
minutes
after
his
entrance
of
his
having
ten
thousand
a
year
the
gentlemen
pronounced
him
to
be
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
the
ladies
declared
he
was
much
handsomer
than
mr
bingley
and
he
was
looked
at
with
great
admiration
for
about
half
the
evening
till
his
manners
gave
a
disgust
which
turned
the
tide
of
his
popularity
for
he
was
discovered
to
be
proud
to
be
above
his
company
and
above
being
pleased
and
not
all
his
large
estate
in
derbyshire
could
then
save
him
from
having
a
most
forbidding
disagreeable
countenance
and
being
unworthy
to
be
compared
with
his
friend
mr
bingley
had
soon
made
himself
acquainted
with
all
the
principal
people
in
the
room
he
was
lively
and
unreserved
danced
every
dance
was
angry
that
the
ball
closed
so
early
and
talked
of
giving
one
himself
at
netherfield
such
amiable
qualities
must
speak
for
themselves
what
a
contrast
between
him
and
his
friend
mr
darcy
danced
only
once
with
mrs
hurst
and
once
with
miss
bingley
declined
being
introduced
to
any
other
lady
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
walking
about
the
room
speaking
occasionally
to
one
of
his
own
party
his
character
was
decided
he
was
the
proudest
most
disagreeable
man
in
the
world
and
everybody
hoped
that
he
would
never
come
there
again
amongst
the
most
violent
against
him
was
mrs
bennet
whose
dislike
of
his
general
behaviour
was
sharpened
into
particular
resentment
by
his
having
slighted
one
of
her
daughters
elizabeth
bennet
had
been
obliged
by
the
scarcity
of
gentlemen
to
sit
down
for
two
dances
and
during
part
of
that
time
mr
darcy
had
been
standing
near
enough
for
her
to
hear
a
conversation
between
him
and
mr
bingley
who
came
from
the
dance
for
a
few
minutes
to
press
his
friend
to
join
it
come
darcy
said
he
i
must
have
you
dance
i
hate
to
see
you
standing
about
by
yourself
in
this
stupid
manner
you
had
much
better
dance
i
certainly
shall
not
you
know
how
i
detest
it
unless
i
am
particularly
acquainted
with
my
partner
at
such
an
assembly
as
this
it
would
be
insupportable
your
sisters
are
engaged
and
there
is
not
another
woman
in
the
room
whom
it
would
not
be
a
punishment
to
me
to
stand
up
with
i
would
not
be
so
fastidious
as
you
are
cried
mr
bingley
for
a
kingdom
upon
my
honour
i
never
met
with
so
many
pleasant
girls
in
my
life
as
i
have
this
evening
and
there
are
several
of
them
you
see
uncommonly
pretty
you
are
dancing
with
the
only
handsome
girl
in
the
room
said
mr
darcy
looking
at
the
eldest
miss
bennet
oh
she
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
i
ever
beheld
but
there
is
one
of
her
sisters
sitting
down
just
behind
you
who
is
very
pretty
and
i
dare
say
very
agreeable
do
let
me
ask
my
partner
to
introduce
you
which
do
you
mean
and
turning
round
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
elizabeth
till
catching
her
eye
he
withdrew
his
own
and
coldly
said
she
is
tolerable
but
not
handsome
enough
to
tempt
me
i
am
in
no
humour
at
present
to
give
consequence
to
young
ladies
who
are
slighted
by
other
men
you
had
better
return
to
your
partner
and
enjoy
her
smiles
for
you
are
wasting
your
time
with
me
mr
bingley
followed
his
advice
mr
darcy
walked
off
and
elizabeth
remained
with
no
very
cordial
feelings
toward
him
she
told
the
story
however
with
great
spirit
among
her
friends
for
she
had
a
lively
playful
disposition
which
delighted
in
anything
ridiculous
the
evening
altogether
passed
off
pleasantly
to
the
whole
family
mrs
bennet
had
seen
her
eldest
daughter
much
admired
by
the
netherfield
party
mr
bingley
had
danced
with
her
twice
and
she
had
been
distinguished
by
his
sisters
jane
was
as
much
gratified
by
this
as
her
mother
could
be
though
in
a
quieter
way
elizabeth
felt
jane
s
pleasure
mary
had
heard
herself
mentioned
to
miss
bingley
as
the
most
accomplished
girl
in
the
neighbourhood
and
catherine
and
lydia
had
been
fortunate
enough
never
to
be
without
partners
which
was
all
that
they
had
yet
learnt
to
care
for
at
a
ball
they
returned
therefore
in
good
spirits
to
longbourn
the
village
where
they
lived
and
of
which
they
were
the
principal
inhabitants
they
found
mr
bennet
still
up
with
a
book
he
was
regardless
of
time
and
on
the
present
occasion
he
had
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
as
to
the
event
of
an
evening
which
had
raised
such
splendid
expectations
he
had
rather
hoped
that
his
wife
s
views
on
the
stranger
would
be
disappointed
but
he
soon
found
out
that
he
had
a
different
story
to
hear
oh
my
dear
mr
bennet
as
she
entered
the
room
we
have
had
a
most
delightful
evening
a
most
excellent
ball
i
wish
you
had
been
there
jane
was
so
admired
nothing
could
be
like
it
everybody
said
how
well
she
looked
and
mr
bingley
thought
her
quite
beautiful
and
danced
with
her
twice
only
think
of
that
my
dear
he
actually
danced
with
her
twice
and
she
was
the
only
creature
in
the
room
that
he
asked
a
second
time
first
of
all
he
asked
miss
lucas
i
was
so
vexed
to
see
him
stand
up
with
her
but
however
he
did
not
admire
her
at
all
indeed
nobody
can
you
know
and
he
seemed
quite
struck
with
jane
as
she
was
going
down
the
dance
so
he
inquired
who
she
was
and
got
introduced
and
asked
her
for
the
two
next
then
the
two
third
he
danced
with
miss
king
and
the
two
fourth
with
maria
lucas
and
the
two
fifth
with
jane
again
and
the
two
sixth
with
lizzy
and
the
boulanger
if
he
had
had
any
compassion
for
me
cried
her
husband
impatiently
he
would
not
have
danced
half
so
much
for
god
s
sake
say
no
more
of
his
partners
oh
that
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
in
the
first
dance
oh
my
dear
i
am
quite
delighted
with
him
he
is
so
excessively
handsome
and
his
sisters
are
charming
women
i
never
in
my
life
saw
anything
more
elegant
than
their
dresses
i
dare
say
the
lace
upon
mrs
hurst
s
gown
here
she
was
interrupted
again
mr
bennet
protested
against
any
description
of
finery
she
was
therefore
obliged
to
seek
another
branch
of
the
subject
and
related
with
much
bitterness
of
spirit
and
some
exaggeration
the
shocking
rudeness
of
mr
darcy
but
i
can
assure
you
she
added
that
lizzy
does
not
lose
much
by
not
suiting
his
fancy
for
he
is
a
most
disagreeable
horrid
man
not
at
all
worth
pleasing
so
high
and
so
conceited
that
there
was
no
enduring
him
he
walked
here
and
he
walked
there
fancying
himself
so
very
great
not
handsome
enough
to
dance
with
i
wish
you
had
been
there
my
dear
to
have
given
him
one
of
your
set
downs
i
quite
detest
the
man
chapter
4
when
jane
and
elizabeth
were
alone
the
former
who
had
been
cautious
in
her
praise
of
mr
bingley
before
expressed
to
her
sister
just
how
very
much
she
admired
him
he
is
just
what
a
young
man
ought
to
be
said
she
sensible
good
humoured
lively
and
i
never
saw
such
happy
manners
so
much
ease
with
such
perfect
good
breeding
he
is
also
handsome
replied
elizabeth
which
a
young
man
ought
likewise
to
be
if
he
possibly
can
his
character
is
thereby
complete
i
was
very
much
flattered
by
his
asking
me
to
dance
a
second
time
i
did
not
expect
such
a
compliment
did
not
you
i
did
for
you
but
that
is
one
great
difference
between
us
compliments
always
take
you
by
surprise
and
me
never
what
could
be
more
natural
than
his
asking
you
again
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
you
were
about
five
times
as
pretty
as
every
other
woman
in
the
room
no
thanks
to
his
gallantry
for
that
well
he
certainly
is
very
agreeable
and
i
give
you
leave
to
like
him
you
have
liked
many
a
stupider
person
dear
lizzy
oh
you
are
a
great
deal
too
apt
you
know
to
like
people
in
general
you
never
see
a
fault
in
anybody
all
the
world
are
good
and
agreeable
in
your
eyes
i
never
heard
you
speak
ill
of
a
human
being
in
your
life
i
would
not
wish
to
be
hasty
in
censuring
anyone
but
i
always
speak
what
i
think
i
know
you
do
and
it
is
that
which
makes
the
wonder
with
your
good
sense
to
be
so
honestly
blind
to
the
follies
and
nonsense
of
others
affectation
of
candour
is
common
enough
one
meets
with
it
everywhere
but
to
be
candid
without
ostentation
or
design
to
take
the
good
of
everybody
s
character
and
make
it
still
better
and
say
nothing
of
the
bad
belongs
to
you
alone
and
so
you
like
this
man
s
sisters
too
do
you
their
manners
are
not
equal
to
his
certainly
not
at
first
but
they
are
very
pleasing
women
when
you
converse
with
them
miss
bingley
is
to
live
with
her
brother
and
keep
his
house
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
we
shall
not
find
a
very
charming
neighbour
in
her
elizabeth
listened
in
silence
but
was
not
convinced
their
behaviour
at
the
assembly
had
not
been
calculated
to
please
in
general
and
with
more
quickness
of
observation
and
less
pliancy
of
temper
than
her
sister
and
with
a
judgement
too
unassailed
by
any
attention
to
herself
she
was
very
little
disposed
to
approve
them
they
were
in
fact
very
fine
ladies
not
deficient
in
good
humour
when
they
were
pleased
nor
in
the
power
of
making
themselves
agreeable
when
they
chose
it
but
proud
and
conceited
they
were
rather
handsome
had
been
educated
in
one
of
the
first
private
seminaries
in
town
had
a
fortune
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
were
in
the
habit
of
spending
more
than
they
ought
and
of
associating
with
people
of
rank
and
were
therefore
in
every
respect
entitled
to
think
well
of
themselves
and
meanly
of
others
they
were
of
a
respectable
family
in
the
north
of
england
a
circumstance
more
deeply
impressed
on
their
memories
than
that
their
brother
s
fortune
and
their
own
had
been
acquired
by
trade
mr
bingley
inherited
property
to
the
amount
of
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
from
his
father
who
had
intended
to
purchase
an
estate
but
did
not
live
to
do
it
mr
bingley
intended
it
likewise
and
sometimes
made
choice
of
his
county
but
as
he
was
now
provided
with
a
good
house
and
the
liberty
of
a
manor
it
was
doubtful
to
many
of
those
who
best
knew
the
easiness
of
his
temper
whether
he
might
not
spend
the
remainder
of
his
days
at
netherfield
and
leave
the
next
generation
to
purchase
his
sisters
were
anxious
for
his
having
an
estate
of
his
own
but
though
he
was
now
only
established
as
a
tenant
miss
bingley
was
by
no
means
unwilling
to
preside
at
his
table
nor
was
mrs
hurst
who
had
married
a
man
of
more
fashion
than
fortune
less
disposed
to
consider
his
house
as
her
home
when
it
suited
her
mr
bingley
had
not
been
of
age
two
years
when
he
was
tempted
by
an
accidental
recommendation
to
look
at
netherfield
house
he
did
look
at
it
and
into
it
for
half
an
hour
was
pleased
with
the
situation
and
the
principal
rooms
satisfied
with
what
the
owner
said
in
its
praise
and
took
it
immediately
between
him
and
darcy
there
was
a
very
steady
friendship
in
spite
of
great
opposition
of
character
bingley
was
endeared
to
darcy
by
the
easiness
openness
and
ductility
of
his
temper
though
no
disposition
could
offer
a
greater
contrast
to
his
own
and
though
with
his
own
he
never
appeared
dissatisfied
on
the
strength
of
darcy
s
regard
bingley
had
the
firmest
reliance
and
of
his
judgement
the
highest
opinion
in
understanding
darcy
was
the
superior
bingley
was
by
no
means
deficient
but
darcy
was
clever
he
was
at
the
same
time
haughty
reserved
and
fastidious
and
his
manners
though
well
bred
were
not
inviting
in
that
respect
his
friend
had
greatly
the
advantage
bingley
was
sure
of
being
liked
wherever
he
appeared
darcy
was
continually
giving
offense
the
manner
in
which
they
spoke
of
the
meryton
assembly
was
sufficiently
characteristic
bingley
had
never
met
with
more
pleasant
people
or
prettier
girls
in
his
life
everybody
had
been
most
kind
and
attentive
to
him
there
had
been
no
formality
no
stiffness
he
had
soon
felt
acquainted
with
all
the
room
and
as
to
miss
bennet
he
could
not
conceive
an
angel
more
beautiful
darcy
on
the
contrary
had
seen
a
collection
of
people
in
whom
there
was
little
beauty
and
no
fashion
for
none
of
whom
he
had
felt
the
smallest
interest
and
from
none
received
either
attention
or
pleasure
miss
bennet
he
acknowledged
to
be
pretty
but
she
smiled
too
much
mrs
hurst
and
her
sister
allowed
it
to
be
so
but
still
they
admired
her
and
liked
her
and
pronounced
her
to
be
a
sweet
girl
and
one
whom
they
would
not
object
to
know
more
of
miss
bennet
was
therefore
established
as
a
sweet
girl
and
their
brother
felt
authorized
by
such
commendation
to
think
of
her
as
he
chose
chapter
5
within
a
short
walk
of
longbourn
lived
a
family
with
whom
the
bennets
were
particularly
intimate
sir
william
lucas
had
been
formerly
in
trade
in
meryton
where
he
had
made
a
tolerable
fortune
and
risen
to
the
honour
of
knighthood
by
an
address
to
the
king
during
his
mayoralty
the
distinction
had
perhaps
been
felt
too
strongly
it
had
given
him
a
disgust
to
his
business
and
to
his
residence
in
a
small
market
town
and
in
quitting
them
both
he
had
removed
with
his
family
to
a
house
about
a
mile
from
meryton
denominated
from
that
period
lucas
lodge
where
he
could
think
with
pleasure
of
his
own
importance
and
unshackled
by
business
occupy
himself
solely
in
being
civil
to
all
the
world
for
though
elated
by
his
rank
it
did
not
render
him
supercilious
on
the
contrary
he
was
all
attention
to
everybody
by
nature
inoffensive
friendly
and
obliging
his
presentation
at
st
james
s
had
made
him
courteous
lady
lucas
was
a
very
good
kind
of
woman
not
too
clever
to
be
a
valuable
neighbour
to
mrs
bennet
they
had
several
children
the
eldest
of
them
a
sensible
intelligent
young
woman
about
twenty
seven
was
elizabeth
s
intimate
friend
that
the
miss
lucases
and
the
miss
bennets
should
meet
to
talk
over
a
ball
was
absolutely
necessary
and
the
morning
after
the
assembly
brought
the
former
to
longbourn
to
hear
and
to
communicate
you
began
the
evening
well
charlotte
said
mrs
bennet
with
civil
self
command
to
miss
lucas
you
were
mr
bingley
s
first
choice
yes
but
he
seemed
to
like
his
second
better
oh
you
mean
jane
i
suppose
because
he
danced
with
her
twice
to
be
sure
that
did
seem
as
if
he
admired
her
indeed
i
rather
believe
he
did
i
heard
something
about
it
but
i
hardly
know
what
something
about
mr
robinson
perhaps
you
mean
what
i
overheard
between
him
and
mr
robinson
did
not
i
mention
it
to
you
mr
robinson
s
asking
him
how
he
liked
our
meryton
assemblies
and
whether
he
did
not
think
there
were
a
great
many
pretty
women
in
the
room
and
which
he
thought
the
prettiest
and
his
answering
immediately
to
the
last
question
oh
the
eldest
miss
bennet
beyond
a
doubt
there
cannot
be
two
opinions
on
that
point
upon
my
word
well
that
is
very
decided
indeed
that
does
seem
as
if
but
however
it
may
all
come
to
nothing
you
know
my
overhearings
were
more
to
the
purpose
than
yours
eliza
said
charlotte
mr
darcy
is
not
so
well
worth
listening
to
as
his
friend
is
he
poor
eliza
to
be
only
just
tolerable
i
beg
you
would
not
put
it
into
lizzy
s
head
to
be
vexed
by
his
ill
treatment
for
he
is
such
a
disagreeable
man
that
it
would
be
quite
a
misfortune
to
be
liked
by
him
mrs
long
told
me
last
night
that
he
sat
close
to
her
for
half
an
hour
without
once
opening
his
lips
are
you
quite
sure
ma
am
is
not
there
a
little
mistake
said
jane
i
certainly
saw
mr
darcy
speaking
to
her
aye
because
she
asked
him
at
last
how
he
liked
netherfield
and
he
could
not
help
answering
her
but
she
said
he
seemed
quite
angry
at
being
spoke
to
miss
bingley
told
me
said
jane
that
he
never
speaks
much
unless
among
his
intimate
acquaintances
with
them
he
is
remarkably
agreeable
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
my
dear
if
he
had
been
so
very
agreeable
he
would
have
talked
to
mrs
long
but
i
can
guess
how
it
was
everybody
says
that
he
is
eat
up
with
pride
and
i
dare
say
he
had
heard
somehow
that
mrs
long
does
not
keep
a
carriage
and
had
come
to
the
ball
in
a
hack
chaise
i
do
not
mind
his
not
talking
to
mrs
long
said
miss
lucas
but
i
wish
he
had
danced
with
eliza
another
time
lizzy
said
her
mother
i
would
not
dance
with
him
if
i
were
you
i
believe
ma
am
i
may
safely
promise
you
never
to
dance
with
him
his
pride
said
miss
lucas
does
not
offend
me
so
much
as
pride
often
does
because
there
is
an
excuse
for
it
one
cannot
wonder
that
so
very
fine
a
young
man
with
family
fortune
everything
in
his
favour
should
think
highly
of
himself
if
i
may
so
express
it
he
has
a
right
to
be
proud
that
is
very
true
replied
elizabeth
and
i
could
easily
forgive
his
pride
if
he
had
not
mortified
mine
pride
observed
mary
who
piqued
herself
upon
the
solidity
of
her
reflections
is
a
very
common
failing
i
believe
by
all
that
i
have
ever
read
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
very
common
indeed
that
human
nature
is
particularly
prone
to
it
and
that
there
are
very
few
of
us
who
do
not
cherish
a
feeling
of
self
complacency
on
the
score
of
some
quality
or
other
real
or
imaginary
vanity
and
pride
are
different
things
though
the
words
are
often
used
synonymously
a
person
may
be
proud
without
being
vain
pride
relates
more
to
our
opinion
of
ourselves
vanity
to
what
we
would
have
others
think
of
us
if
i
were
as
rich
as
mr
darcy
cried
a
young
lucas
who
came
with
his
sisters
i
should
not
care
how
proud
i
was
i
would
keep
a
pack
of
foxhounds
and
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
a
day
then
you
would
drink
a
great
deal
more
than
you
ought
said
mrs
bennet
and
if
i
were
to
see
you
at
it
i
should
take
away
your
bottle
directly
the
boy
protested
that
she
should
not
she
continued
to
declare
that
she
would
and
the
argument
ended
only
with
the
visit
chapter
6
the
ladies
of
longbourn
soon
waited
on
those
of
netherfield
the
visit
was
soon
returned
in
due
form
miss
bennet
s
pleasing
manners
grew
on
the
goodwill
of
mrs
hurst
and
miss
bingley
and
though
the
mother
was
found
to
be
intolerable
and
the
younger
sisters
not
worth
speaking
to
a
wish
of
being
better
acquainted
with
them
was
expressed
towards
the
two
eldest
by
jane
this
attention
was
received
with
the
greatest
pleasure
but
elizabeth
still
saw
superciliousness
in
their
treatment
of
everybody
hardly
excepting
even
her
sister
and
could
not
like
them
though
their
kindness
to
jane
such
as
it
was
had
a
value
as
arising
in
all
probability
from
the
influence
of
their
brother
s
admiration
it
was
generally
evident
whenever
they
met
that
he
did
admire
her
and
to
her
it
was
equally
evident
that
jane
was
yielding
to
the
preference
which
she
had
begun
to
entertain
for
him
from
the
first
and
was
in
a
way
to
be
very
much
in
love
but
she
considered
with
pleasure
that
it
was
not
likely
to
be
discovered
by
the
world
in
general
since
jane
united
with
great
strength
of
feeling
a
composure
of
temper
and
a
uniform
cheerfulness
of
manner
which
would
guard
her
from
the
suspicions
of
the
impertinent
she
mentioned
this
to
her
friend
miss
lucas
it
may
perhaps
be
pleasant
replied
charlotte
to
be
able
to
impose
on
the
public
in
such
a
case
but
it
is
sometimes
a
disadvantage
to
be
so
very
guarded
if
a
woman
conceals
her
affection
with
the
same
skill
from
the
object
of
it
she
may
lose
the
opportunity
of
fixing
him
and
it
will
then
be
but
poor
consolation
to
believe
the
world
equally
in
the
dark
there
is
so
much
of
gratitude
or
vanity
in
almost
every
attachment
that
it
is
not
safe
to
leave
any
to
itself
we
can
all
begin
freely
a
slight
preference
is
natural
enough
but
there
are
very
few
of
us
who
have
heart
enough
to
be
really
in
love
without
encouragement
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
women
had
better
show
more
affection
than
she
feels
bingley
likes
your
sister
undoubtedly
but
he
may
never
do
more
than
like
her
if
she
does
not
help
him
on
but
she
does
help
him
on
as
much
as
her
nature
will
allow
if
i
can
perceive
her
regard
for
him
he
must
be
a
simpleton
indeed
not
to
discover
it
too
remember
eliza
that
he
does
not
know
jane
s
disposition
as
you
do
but
if
a
woman
is
partial
to
a
man
and
does
not
endeavour
to
conceal
it
he
must
find
it
out
perhaps
he
must
if
he
sees
enough
of
her
but
though
bingley
and
jane
meet
tolerably
often
it
is
never
for
many
hours
together
and
as
they
always
see
each
other
in
large
mixed
parties
it
is
impossible
that
every
moment
should
be
employed
in
conversing
together
jane
should
therefore
make
the
most
of
every
half
hour
in
which
she
can
command
his
attention
when
she
is
secure
of
him
there
will
be
more
leisure
for
falling
in
love
as
much
as
she
chooses
your
plan
is
a
good
one
replied
elizabeth
where
nothing
is
in
question
but
the
desire
of
being
well
married
and
if
i
were
determined
to
get
a
rich
husband
or
any
husband
i
dare
say
i
should
adopt
it
but
these
are
not
jane
s
feelings
she
is
not
acting
by
design
as
yet
she
cannot
even
be
certain
of
the
degree
of
her
own
regard
nor
of
its
reasonableness
she
has
known
him
only
a
fortnight
she
danced
four
dances
with
him
at
meryton
she
saw
him
one
morning
at
his
own
house
and
has
since
dined
with
him
in
company
four
times
this
is
not
quite
enough
to
make
her
understand
his
character
not
as
you
represent
it
had
she
merely
dined
with
him
she
might
only
have
discovered
whether
he
had
a
good
appetite
but
you
must
remember
that
four
evenings
have
also
been
spent
together
and
four
evenings
may
do
a
great
deal
yes
these
four
evenings
have
enabled
them
to
ascertain
that
they
both
like
vingt
un
better
than
commerce
but
with
respect
to
any
other
leading
characteristic
i
do
not
imagine
that
much
has
been
unfolded
well
said
charlotte
i
wish
jane
success
with
all
my
heart
and
if
she
were
married
to
him
to
morrow
i
should
think
she
had
as
good
a
chance
of
happiness
as
if
she
were
to
be
studying
his
character
for
a
twelvemonth
happiness
in
marriage
is
entirely
a
matter
of
chance
if
the
dispositions
of
the
parties
are
ever
so
well
known
to
each
other
or
ever
so
similar
beforehand
it
does
not
advance
their
felicity
in
the
least
they
always
continue
to
grow
sufficiently
unlike
afterwards
to
have
their
share
of
vexation
and
it
is
better
to
know
as
little
as
possible
of
the
defects
of
the
person
with
whom
you
are
to
pass
your
life
you
make
me
laugh
charlotte
but
it
is
not
sound
you
know
it
is
not
sound
and
that
you
would
never
act
in
this
way
yourself
occupied
in
observing
mr
bingley
s
attentions
to
her
sister
elizabeth
was
far
from
suspecting
that
she
was
herself
becoming
an
object
of
some
interest
in
the
eyes
of
his
friend
mr
darcy
had
at
first
scarcely
allowed
her
to
be
pretty
he
had
looked
at
her
without
admiration
at
the
ball
and
when
they
next
met
he
looked
at
her
only
to
criticise
but
no
sooner
had
he
made
it
clear
to
himself
and
his
friends
that
she
hardly
had
a
good
feature
in
her
face
than
he
began
to
find
it
was
rendered
uncommonly
intelligent
by
the
beautiful
expression
of
her
dark
eyes
to
this
discovery
succeeded
some
others
equally
mortifying
though
he
had
detected
with
a
critical
eye
more
than
one
failure
of
perfect
symmetry
in
her
form
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
her
figure
to
be
light
and
pleasing
and
in
spite
of
his
asserting
that
her
manners
were
not
those
of
the
fashionable
world
he
was
caught
by
their
easy
playfulness
of
this
she
was
perfectly
unaware
to
her
he
was
only
the
man
who
made
himself
agreeable
nowhere
and
who
had
not
thought
her
handsome
enough
to
dance
with
he
began
to
wish
to
know
more
of
her
and
as
a
step
towards
conversing
with
her
himself
attended
to
her
conversation
with
others
his
doing
so
drew
her
notice
it
was
at
sir
william
lucas
s
where
a
large
party
were
assembled
what
does
mr
darcy
mean
said
she
to
charlotte
by
listening
to
my
conversation
with
colonel
forster
that
is
a
question
which
mr
darcy
only
can
answer
but
if
he
does
it
any
more
i
shall
certainly
let
him
know
that
i
see
what
he
is
about
he
has
a
very
satirical
eye
and
if
i
do
not
begin
by
being
impertinent
myself
i
shall
soon
grow
afraid
of
him
on
his
approaching
them
soon
afterwards
though
without
seeming
to
have
any
intention
of
speaking
miss
lucas
defied
her
friend
to
mention
such
a
subject
to
him
which
immediately
provoking
elizabeth
to
do
it
she
turned
to
him
and
said
did
you
not
think
mr
darcy
that
i
expressed
myself
uncommonly
well
just
now
when
i
was
teasing
colonel
forster
to
give
us
a
ball
at
meryton
with
great
energy
but
it
is
always
a
subject
which
makes
a
lady
energetic
you
are
severe
on
us
it
will
be
her
turn
soon
to
be
teased
said
miss
lucas
i
am
going
to
open
the
instrument
eliza
and
you
know
what
follows
you
are
a
very
strange
creature
by
way
of
a
friend
always
wanting
me
to
play
and
sing
before
anybody
and
everybody
if
my
vanity
had
taken
a
musical
turn
you
would
have
been
invaluable
but
as
it
is
i
would
really
rather
not
sit
down
before
those
who
must
be
in
the
habit
of
hearing
the
very
best
performers
on
miss
lucas
s
persevering
however
she
added
very
well
if
it
must
be
so
it
must
and
gravely
glancing
at
mr
darcy
there
is
a
fine
old
saying
which
everybody
here
is
of
course
familiar
with
keep
your
breath
to
cool
your
porridge
and
i
shall
keep
mine
to
swell
my
song
her
performance
was
pleasing
though
by
no
means
capital
after
a
song
or
two
and
before
she
could
reply
to
the
entreaties
of
several
that
she
would
sing
again
she
was
eagerly
succeeded
at
the
instrument
by
her
sister
mary
who
having
in
consequence
of
being
the
only
plain
one
in
the
family
worked
hard
for
knowledge
and
accomplishments
was
always
impatient
for
display
mary
had
neither
genius
nor
taste
and
though
vanity
had
given
her
application
it
had
given
her
likewise
a
pedantic
air
and
conceited
manner
which
would
have
injured
a
higher
degree
of
excellence
than
she
had
reached
elizabeth
easy
and
unaffected
had
been
listened
to
with
much
more
pleasure
though
not
playing
half
so
well
and
mary
at
the
end
of
a
long
concerto
was
glad
to
purchase
praise
and
gratitude
by
scotch
and
irish
airs
at
the
request
of
her
younger
sisters
who
with
some
of
the
lucases
and
two
or
three
officers
joined
eagerly
in
dancing
at
one
end
of
the
room
mr
darcy
stood
near
them
in
silent
indignation
at
such
a
mode
of
passing
the
evening
to
the
exclusion
of
all
conversation
and
was
too
much
engrossed
by
his
thoughts
to
perceive
that
sir
william
lucas
was
his
neighbour
till
sir
william
thus
began
what
a
charming
amusement
for
young
people
this
is
mr
darcy
there
is
nothing
like
dancing
after
all
i
consider
it
as
one
of
the
first
refinements
of
polished
society
certainly
sir
and
it
has
the
advantage
also
of
being
in
vogue
amongst
the
less
polished
societies
of
the
world
every
savage
can
dance
sir
william
only
smiled
your
friend
performs
delightfully
he
continued
after
a
pause
on
seeing
bingley
join
the
group
and
i
doubt
not
that
you
are
an
adept
in
the
science
yourself
mr
darcy
you
saw
me
dance
at
meryton
i
believe
sir
yes
indeed
and
received
no
inconsiderable
pleasure
from
the
sight
do
you
often
dance
at
st
james
s
never
sir
do
you
not
think
it
would
be
a
proper
compliment
to
the
place
it
is
a
compliment
which
i
never
pay
to
any
place
if
i
can
avoid
it
you
have
a
house
in
town
i
conclude
mr
darcy
bowed
i
had
once
had
some
thought
of
fixing
in
town
myself
for
i
am
fond
of
superior
society
but
i
did
not
feel
quite
certain
that
the
air
of
london
would
agree
with
lady
lucas
he
paused
in
hopes
of
an
answer
but
his
companion
was
not
disposed
to
make
any
and
elizabeth
at
that
instant
moving
towards
them
he
was
struck
with
the
action
of
doing
a
very
gallant
thing
and
called
out
to
her
my
dear
miss
eliza
why
are
you
not
dancing
mr
darcy
you
must
allow
me
to
present
this
young
lady
to
you
as
a
very
desirable
partner
you
cannot
refuse
to
dance
i
am
sure
when
so
much
beauty
is
before
you
and
taking
her
hand
he
would
have
given
it
to
mr
darcy
who
though
extremely
surprised
was
not
unwilling
to
receive
it
when
she
instantly
drew
back
and
said
with
some
discomposure
to
sir
william
indeed
sir
i
have
not
the
least
intention
of
dancing
i
entreat
you
not
to
suppose
that
i
moved
this
way
in
order
to
beg
for
a
partner
mr
darcy
with
grave
propriety
requested
to
be
allowed
the
honour
of
her
hand
but
in
vain
elizabeth
was
determined
nor
did
sir
william
at
all
shake
her
purpose
by
his
attempt
at
persuasion
you
excel
so
much
in
the
dance
miss
eliza
that
it
is
cruel
to
deny
me
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
and
though
this
gentleman
dislikes
the
amusement
in
general
he
can
have
no
objection
i
am
sure
to
oblige
us
for
one
half
hour
mr
darcy
is
all
politeness
said
elizabeth
smiling
he
is
indeed
but
considering
the
inducement
my
dear
miss
eliza
we
cannot
wonder
at
his
complaisance
for
who
would
object
to
such
a
partner
elizabeth
looked
archly
and
turned
away
her
resistance
had
not
injured
her
with
the
gentleman
and
he
was
thinking
of
her
with
some
complacency
when
thus
accosted
by
miss
bingley
i
can
guess
the
subject
of
your
reverie
i
should
imagine
not
you
are
considering
how
insupportable
it
would
be
to
pass
many
evenings
in
this
manner
in
such
society
and
indeed
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
i
was
never
more
annoyed
the
insipidity
and
yet
the
noise
the
nothingness
and
yet
the
self
importance
of
all
those
people
what
would
i
give
to
hear
your
strictures
on
them
your
conjecture
is
totally
wrong
i
assure
you
my
mind
was
more
agreeably
engaged
i
have
been
meditating
on
the
very
great
pleasure
which
a
pair
of
fine
eyes
in
the
face
of
a
pretty
woman
can
bestow
miss
bingley
immediately
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
face
and
desired
he
would
tell
her
what
lady
had
the
credit
of
inspiring
such
reflections
mr
darcy
replied
with
great
intrepidity
miss
elizabeth
bennet
miss
elizabeth
bennet
repeated
miss
bingley
i
am
all
astonishment
how
long
has
she
been
such
a
favourite
and
pray
when
am
i
to
wish
you
joy
that
is
exactly
the
question
which
i
expected
you
to
ask
a
lady
s
imagination
is
very
rapid
it
jumps
from
admiration
to
love
from
love
to
matrimony
in
a
moment
i
knew
you
would
be
wishing
me
joy
nay
if
you
are
serious
about
it
i
shall
consider
the
matter
is
absolutely
settled
you
will
be
having
a
charming
mother
in
law
indeed
and
of
course
she
will
always
be
at
pemberley
with
you
he
listened
to
her
with
perfect
indifference
while
she
chose
to
entertain
herself
in
this
manner
and
as
his
composure
convinced
her
that
all
was
safe
her
wit
flowed
long
chapter

mr
bennet
s
property
consisted
almost
entirely
in
an
estate
of
two
thousand
a
year
which
unfortunately
for
his
daughters
was
entailed
in
default
of
heirs
male
on
a
distant
relation
and
their
mother
s
fortune
though
ample
for
her
situation
in
life
could
but
ill
supply
the
deficiency
of
his
her
father
had
been
an
attorney
in
meryton
and
had
left
her
four
thousand
pounds
she
had
a
sister
married
to
a
mr
phillips
who
had
been
a
clerk
to
their
father
and
succeeded
him
in
the
business
and
a
brother
settled
in
london
in
a
respectable
line
of
trade
the
village
of
longbourn
was
only
one
mile
from
meryton
a
most
convenient
distance
for
the
young
ladies
who
were
usually
tempted
thither
three
or
four
times
a
week
to
pay
their
duty
to
their
aunt
and
to
a
milliner
s
shop
just
over
the
way
the
two
youngest
of
the
family
catherine
and
lydia
were
particularly
frequent
in
these
attentions
their
minds
were
more
vacant
than
their
sisters
and
when
nothing
better
offered
a
walk
to
meryton
was
necessary
to
amuse
their
morning
hours
and
furnish
conversation
for
the
evening
and
however
bare
of
news
the
country
in
general
might
be
they
always
contrived
to
learn
some
from
their
aunt
at
present
indeed
they
were
well
supplied
both
with
news
and
happiness
by
the
recent
arrival
of
a
militia
regiment
in
the
neighbourhood
it
was
to
remain
the
whole
winter
and
meryton
was
the
headquarters
their
visits
to
mrs
phillips
were
now
productive
of
the
most
interesting
intelligence
every
day
added
something
to
their
knowledge
of
the
officers
names
and
connections
their
lodgings
were
not
long
a
secret
and
at
length
they
began
to
know
the
officers
themselves
mr
phillips
visited
them
all
and
this
opened
to
his
nieces
a
store
of
felicity
unknown
before
they
could
talk
of
nothing
but
officers
and
mr
bingley
s
large
fortune
the
mention
of
which
gave
animation
to
their
mother
was
worthless
in
their
eyes
when
opposed
to
the
regimentals
of
an
ensign
after
listening
one
morning
to
their
effusions
on
this
subject
mr
bennet
coolly
observed
from
all
that
i
can
collect
by
your
manner
of
talking
you
must
be
two
of
the
silliest
girls
in
the
country
i
have
suspected
it
some
time
but
i
am
now
convinced
catherine
was
disconcerted
and
made
no
answer
but
lydia
with
perfect
indifference
continued
to
express
her
admiration
of
captain
carter
and
her
hope
of
seeing
him
in
the
course
of
the
day
as
he
was
going
the
next
morning
to
london
i
am
astonished
my
dear
said
mrs
bennet
that
you
should
be
so
ready
to
think
your
own
children
silly
if
i
wished
to
think
slightingly
of
anybody
s
children
it
should
not
be
of
my
own
however
if
my
children
are
silly
i
must
hope
to
be
always
sensible
of
it
yes
but
as
it
happens
they
are
all
of
them
very
clever
this
is
the
only
point
i
flatter
myself
on
which
we
do
not
agree
i
had
hoped
that
our
sentiments
coincided
in
every
particular
but
i
must
so
far
differ
from
you
as
to
think
our
two
youngest
daughters
uncommonly
foolish
my
dear
mr
bennet
you
must
not
expect
such
girls
to
have
the
sense
of
their
father
and
mother
when
they
get
to
our
age
i
dare
say
they
will
not
think
about
officers
any
more
than
we
do
i
remember
the
time
when
i
liked
a
red
coat
myself
very
well
and
indeed
so
i
do
still
at
my
heart
and
if
a
smart
young
colonel
with
five
or
six
thousand
a
year
should
want
one
of
my
girls
i
shall
not
say
nay
to
him
and
i
thought
colonel
forster
looked
very
becoming
the
other
night
at
sir
william
s
in
his
regimentals
mamma
cried
lydia
my
aunt
says
that
colonel
forster
and
captain
carter
do
not
go
so
often
to
miss
watson
s
as
they
did
when
they
first
came
she
sees
them
now
very
often
standing
in
clarke
s
library
mrs
bennet
was
prevented
replying
by
the
entrance
of
the
footman
with
a
note
for
miss
bennet
it
came
from
netherfield
and
the
servant
waited
for
an
answer
mrs
bennet
s
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
and
she
was
eagerly
calling
out
while
her
daughter
read
well
jane
who
is
it
from
what
is
it
about
what
does
he
say
well
jane
make
haste
and
tell
us
make
haste
my
love
it
is
from
miss
bingley
said
jane
and
then
read
it
aloud
my
dear
friend
if
you
are
not
so
compassionate
as
to
dine
to
day
with
louisa
and
me
we
shall
be
in
danger
of
hating
each
other
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
for
a
whole
day
s
tete
a
tete
between
two
women
can
never
end
without
a
quarrel
come
as
soon
as
you
can
on
receipt
of
this
my
brother
and
the
gentlemen
are
to
dine
with
the
officers
yours
ever
caroline
bingley
with
the
officers
cried
lydia
i
wonder
my
aunt
did
not
tell
us
of
that
dining
out
said
mrs
bennet
that
is
very
unlucky
can
i
have
the
carriage
said
jane
no
my
dear
you
had
better
go
on
horseback
because
it
seems
likely
to
rain
and
then
you
must
stay
all
night
that
would
be
a
good
scheme
said
elizabeth
if
you
were
sure
that
they
would
not
offer
to
send
her
home
oh
but
the
gentlemen
will
have
mr
bingley
s
chaise
to
go
to
meryton
and
the
hursts
have
no
horses
to
theirs
i
had
much
rather
go
in
the
coach
but
my
dear
your
father
cannot
spare
the
horses
i
am
sure
they
are
wanted
in
the
farm
mr
bennet
are
they
not
they
are
wanted
in
the
farm
much
oftener
than
i
can
get
them
but
if
you
have
got
them
to
day
said
elizabeth
my
mother
s
purpose
will
be
answered
she
did
at
last
extort
from
her
father
an
acknowledgment
that
the
horses
were
engaged
jane
was
therefore
obliged
to
go
on
horseback
and
her
mother
attended
her
to
the
door
with
many
cheerful
prognostics
of
a
bad
day
her
hopes
were
answered
jane
had
not
been
gone
long
before
it
rained
hard
her
sisters
were
uneasy
for
her
but
her
mother
was
delighted
the
rain
continued
the
whole
evening
without
intermission
jane
certainly
could
not
come
back
this
was
a
lucky
idea
of
mine
indeed
said
mrs
bennet
more
than
once
as
if
the
credit
of
making
it
rain
were
all
her
own
till
the
next
morning
however
she
was
not
aware
of
all
the
felicity
of
her
contrivance
breakfast
was
scarcely
over
when
a
servant
from
netherfield
brought
the
following
note
for
elizabeth
my
dearest
lizzy
i
find
myself
very
unwell
this
morning
which
i
suppose
is
to
be
imputed
to
my
getting
wet
through
yesterday
my
kind
friends
will
not
hear
of
my
returning
till
i
am
better
they
insist
also
on
my
seeing
mr
jones
therefore
do
not
be
alarmed
if
you
should
hear
of
his
having
been
to
me
and
excepting
a
sore
throat
and
headache
there
is
not
much
the
matter
with
me
yours
etc
well
my
dear
said
mr
bennet
when
elizabeth
had
read
the
note
aloud
if
your
daughter
should
have
a
dangerous
fit
of
illness
if
she
should
die
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
know
that
it
was
all
in
pursuit
of
mr
bingley
and
under
your
orders
oh
i
am
not
afraid
of
her
dying
people
do
not
die
of
little
trifling
colds
she
will
be
taken
good
care
of
as
long
as
she
stays
there
it
is
all
very
well
i
would
go
and
see
her
if
i
could
have
the
carriage
elizabeth
feeling
really
anxious
was
determined
to
go
to
her
though
the
carriage
was
not
to
be
had
and
as
she
was
no
horsewoman
walking
was
her
only
alternative
she
declared
her
resolution
how
can
you
be
so
silly
cried
her
mother
as
to
think
of
such
a
thing
in
all
this
dirt
you
will
not
be
fit
to
be
seen
when
you
get
there
i
shall
be
very
fit
to
see
jane
which
is
all
i
want
is
this
a
hint
to
me
lizzy
said
her
father
to
send
for
the
horses
no
indeed
i
do
not
wish
to
avoid
the
walk
the
distance
is
nothing
when
one
has
a
motive
only
three
miles
i
shall
be
back
by
dinner
i
admire
the
activity
of
your
benevolence
observed
mary
but
every
impulse
of
feeling
should
be
guided
by
reason
and
in
my
opinion
exertion
should
always
be
in
proportion
to
what
is
required
we
will
go
as
far
as
meryton
with
you
said
catherine
and
lydia
elizabeth
accepted
their
company
and
the
three
young
ladies
set
off
together
if
we
make
haste
said
lydia
as
they
walked
along
perhaps
we
may
see
something
of
captain
carter
before
he
goes
in
meryton
they
parted
the
two
youngest
repaired
to
the
lodgings
of
one
of
the
officers
wives
and
elizabeth
continued
her
walk
alone
crossing
field
after
field
at
a
quick
pace
jumping
over
stiles
and
springing
over
puddles
with
impatient
activity
and
finding
herself
at
last
within
view
of
the
house
with
weary
ankles
dirty
stockings
and
a
face
glowing
with
the
warmth
of
exercise
she
was
shown
into
the
breakfast
parlour
where
all
but
jane
were
assembled
and
where
her
appearance
created
a
great
deal
of
surprise
that
she
should
have
walked
three
miles
so
early
in
the
day
in
such
dirty
weather
and
by
herself
was
almost
incredible
to
mrs
hurst
and
miss
bingley
and
elizabeth
was
convinced
that
they
held
her
in
contempt
for
it
she
was
received
however
very
politely
by
them
and
in
their
brother
s
manners
there
was
something
better
than
politeness
there
was
good
humour
and
kindness
mr
darcy
said
very
little
and
mr
hurst
nothing
at
all
the
former
was
divided
between
admiration
of
the
brilliancy
which
exercise
had
given
to
her
complexion
and
doubt
as
to
the
occasion
s
justifying
her
coming
so
far
alone
the
latter
was
thinking
only
of
his
breakfast
her
inquiries
after
her
sister
were
not
very
favourably
answered
miss
bennet
had
slept
ill
and
though
up
was
very
feverish
and
not
well
enough
to
leave
her
room
elizabeth
was
glad
to
be
taken
to
her
immediately
and
jane
who
had
only
been
withheld
by
the
fear
of
giving
alarm
or
inconvenience
from
expressing
in
her
note
how
much
she
longed
for
such
a
visit
was
delighted
at
her
entrance
she
was
not
equal
however
to
much
conversation
and
when
miss
bingley
left
them
together
could
attempt
little
besides
expressions
of
gratitude
for
the
extraordinary
kindness
she
was
treated
with
elizabeth
silently
attended
her
when
breakfast
was
over
they
were
joined
by
the
sisters
and
elizabeth
began
to
like
them
herself
when
she
saw
how
much
affection
and
solicitude
they
showed
for
jane
the
apothecary
came
and
having
examined
his
patient
said
as
might
be
supposed
that
she
had
caught
a
violent
cold
and
that
they
must
endeavour
to
get
the
better
of
it
advised
her
to
return
to
bed
and
promised
her
some
draughts
the
advice
was
followed
readily
for
the
feverish
symptoms
increased
and
her
head
ached
acutely
elizabeth
did
not
quit
her
room
for
a
moment
nor
were
the
other
ladies
often
absent
the
gentlemen
being
out
they
had
in
fact
nothing
to
do
elsewhere
when
the
clock
struck
three
elizabeth
felt
that
she
must
go
and
very
unwillingly
said
so
miss
bingley
offered
her
the
carriage
and
she
only
wanted
a
little
pressing
to
accept
it
when
jane
testified
such
concern
in
parting
with
her
that
miss
bingley
was
obliged
to
convert
the
offer
of
the
chaise
to
an
invitation
to
remain
at
netherfield
for
the
present
elizabeth
most
thankfully
consented
and
a
servant
was
dispatched
to
longbourn
to
acquaint
the
family
with
her
stay
and
bring
back
a
supply
of
clothes
chapter
8
at
five
o
clock
the
two
ladies
retired
to
dress
and
at
half
past
six
elizabeth
was
summoned
to
dinner
to
the
civil
inquiries
which
then
poured
in
and
amongst
which
she
had
the
pleasure
of
distinguishing
the
much
superior
solicitude
of
mr
bingley
s
she
could
not
make
a
very
favourable
answer
jane
was
by
no
means
better
the
sisters
on
hearing
this
repeated
three
or
four
times
how
much
they
were
grieved
how
shocking
it
was
to
have
a
bad
cold
and
how
excessively
they
disliked
being
ill
themselves
and
then
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
and
their
indifference
towards
jane
when
not
immediately
before
them
restored
elizabeth
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
her
former
dislike
their
brother
indeed
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
whom
she
could
regard
with
any
complacency
his
anxiety
for
jane
was
evident
and
his
attentions
to
herself
most
pleasing
and
they
prevented
her
feeling
herself
so
much
an
intruder
as
she
believed
she
was
considered
by
the
others
she
had
very
little
notice
from
any
but
him
miss
bingley
was
engrossed
by
mr
darcy
her
sister
scarcely
less
so
and
as
for
mr
hurst
by
whom
elizabeth
sat
he
was
an
indolent
man
who
lived
only
to
eat
drink
and
play
at
cards
who
when
he
found
her
to
prefer
a
plain
dish
to
a
ragout
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
when
dinner
was
over
she
returned
directly
to
jane
and
miss
bingley
began
abusing
her
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
room
her
manners
were
pronounced
to
be
very
bad
indeed
a
mixture
of
pride
and
impertinence
she
had
no
conversation
no
style
no
beauty
mrs
hurst
thought
the
same
and
added
she
has
nothing
in
short
to
recommend
her
but
being
an
excellent
walker
i
shall
never
forget
her
appearance
this
morning
she
really
looked
almost
wild
she
did
indeed
louisa
i
could
hardly
keep
my
countenance
very
nonsensical
to
come
at
all
why
must
she
be
scampering
about
the
country
because
her
sister
had
a
cold
her
hair
so
untidy
so
blowsy
yes
and
her
petticoat
i
hope
you
saw
her
petticoat
six
inches
deep
in
mud
i
am
absolutely
certain
and
the
gown
which
had
been
let
down
to
hide
it
not
doing
its
office
your
picture
may
be
very
exact
louisa
said
bingley
but
this
was
all
lost
upon
me
i
thought
miss
elizabeth
bennet
looked
remarkably
well
when
she
came
into
the
room
this
morning
her
dirty
petticoat
quite
escaped
my
notice
you
observed
it
mr
darcy
i
am
sure
said
miss
bingley
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
you
would
not
wish
to
see
your
sister
make
such
an
exhibition
certainly
not
to
walk
three
miles
or
four
miles
or
five
miles
or
whatever
it
is
above
her
ankles
in
dirt
and
alone
quite
alone
what
could
she
mean
by
it
it
seems
to
me
to
show
an
abominable
sort
of
conceited
independence
a
most
country
town
indifference
to
decorum
it
shows
an
affection
for
her
sister
that
is
very
pleasing
said
bingley
i
am
afraid
mr
darcy
observed
miss
bingley
in
a
half
whisper
that
this
adventure
has
rather
affected
your
admiration
of
her
fine
eyes
not
at
all
he
replied
they
were
brightened
by
the
exercise
a
short
pause
followed
this
speech
and
mrs
hurst
began
again
i
have
an
excessive
regard
for
miss
jane
bennet
she
is
really
a
very
sweet
girl
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
she
were
well
settled
but
with
such
a
father
and
mother
and
such
low
connections
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
chance
of
it
i
think
i
have
heard
you
say
that
their
uncle
is
an
attorney
in
meryton
yes
and
they
have
another
who
lives
somewhere
near
cheapside
that
is
capital
added
her
sister
and
they
both
laughed
heartily
if
they
had
uncles
enough
to
fill
all
cheapside
cried
bingley
it
would
not
make
them
one
jot
less
agreeable
but
it
must
very
materially
lessen
their
chance
of
marrying
men
of
any
consideration
in
the
world
replied
darcy
to
this
speech
bingley
made
no
answer
but
his
sisters
gave
it
their
hearty
assent
and
indulged
their
mirth
for
some
time
at
the
expense
of
their
dear
friend
s
vulgar
relations
with
a
renewal
of
tenderness
however
they
returned
to
her
room
on
leaving
the
dining
parlour
and
sat
with
her
till
summoned
to
coffee
she
was
still
very
poorly
and
elizabeth
would
not
quit
her
at
all
till
late
in
the
evening
when
she
had
the
comfort
of
seeing
her
sleep
and
when
it
seemed
to
her
rather
right
than
pleasant
that
she
should
go
downstairs
herself
on
entering
the
drawing
room
she
found
the
whole
party
at
loo
and
was
immediately
invited
to
join
them
but
suspecting
them
to
be
playing
high
she
declined
it
and
making
her
sister
the
excuse
said
she
would
amuse
herself
for
the
short
time
she
could
stay
below
with
a
book
mr
hurst
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
do
you
prefer
reading
to
cards
said
he
that
is
rather
singular
miss
eliza
bennet
said
miss
bingley
despises
cards
she
is
a
great
reader
and
has
no
pleasure
in
anything
else
i
deserve
neither
such
praise
nor
such
censure
cried
elizabeth
i
am
not
a
great
reader
and
i
have
pleasure
in
many
things
in
nursing
your
sister
i
am
sure
you
have
pleasure
said
bingley
and
i
hope
it
will
be
soon
increased
by
seeing
her
quite
well
elizabeth
thanked
him
from
her
heart
and
then
walked
towards
the
table
where
a
few
books
were
lying
he
immediately
offered
to
fetch
her
others
all
that
his
library
afforded
and
i
wish
my
collection
were
larger
for
your
benefit
and
my
own
credit
but
i
am
an
idle
fellow
and
though
i
have
not
many
i
have
more
than
i
ever
looked
into
elizabeth
assured
him
that
she
could
suit
herself
perfectly
with
those
in
the
room
i
am
astonished
said
miss
bingley
that
my
father
should
have
left
so
small
a
collection
of
books
what
a
delightful
library
you
have
at
pemberley
mr
darcy
it
ought
to
be
good
he
replied
it
has
been
the
work
of
many
generations
and
then
you
have
added
so
much
to
it
yourself
you
are
always
buying
books
i
cannot
comprehend
the
neglect
of
a
family
library
in
such
days
as
these
neglect
i
am
sure
you
neglect
nothing
that
can
add
to
the
beauties
of
that
noble
place
charles
when
you
build
your
house
i
wish
it
may
be
half
as
delightful
as
pemberley
i
wish
it
may
but
i
would
really
advise
you
to
make
your
purchase
in
that
neighbourhood
and
take
pemberley
for
a
kind
of
model
there
is
not
a
finer
county
in
england
than
derbyshire
with
all
my
heart
i
will
buy
pemberley
itself
if
darcy
will
sell
it
i
am
talking
of
possibilities
charles
upon
my
word
caroline
i
should
think
it
more
possible
to
get
pemberley
by
purchase
than
by
imitation
elizabeth
was
so
much
caught
with
what
passed
as
to
leave
her
very
little
attention
for
her
book
and
soon
laying
it
wholly
aside
she
drew
near
the
card
table
and
stationed
herself
between
mr
bingley
and
his
eldest
sister
to
observe
the
game
is
miss
darcy
much
grown
since
the
spring
said
miss
bingley
will
she
be
as
tall
as
i
am
i
think
she
will
she
is
now
about
miss
elizabeth
bennet
s
height
or
rather
taller
how
i
long
to
see
her
again
i
never
met
with
anybody
who
delighted
me
so
much
such
a
countenance
such
manners
and
so
extremely
accomplished
for
her
age
her
performance
on
the
pianoforte
is
exquisite
it
is
amazing
to
me
said
bingley
how
young
ladies
can
have
patience
to
be
so
very
accomplished
as
they
all
are
all
young
ladies
accomplished
my
dear
charles
what
do
you
mean
yes
all
of
them
i
think
they
all
paint
tables
cover
screens
and
net
purses
i
scarcely
know
anyone
who
cannot
do
all
this
and
i
am
sure
i
never
heard
a
young
lady
spoken
of
for
the
first
time
without
being
informed
that
she
was
very
accomplished
your
list
of
the
common
extent
of
accomplishments
said
darcy
has
too
much
truth
the
word
is
applied
to
many
a
woman
who
deserves
it
no
otherwise
than
by
netting
a
purse
or
covering
a
screen
but
i
am
very
far
from
agreeing
with
you
in
your
estimation
of
ladies
in
general
i
cannot
boast
of
knowing
more
than
half
a
dozen
in
the
whole
range
of
my
acquaintance
that
are
really
accomplished
nor
i
i
am
sure
said
miss
bingley
then
observed
elizabeth
you
must
comprehend
a
great
deal
in
your
idea
of
an
accomplished
woman
yes
i
do
comprehend
a
great
deal
in
it
oh
certainly
cried
his
faithful
assistant
no
one
can
be
really
esteemed
accomplished
who
does
not
greatly
surpass
what
is
usually
met
with
a
woman
must
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
music
singing
drawing
dancing
and
the
modern
languages
to
deserve
the
word
and
besides
all
this
she
must
possess
a
certain
something
in
her
air
and
manner
of
walking
the
tone
of
her
voice
her
address
and
expressions
or
the
word
will
be
but
half
deserved
all
this
she
must
possess
added
darcy
and
to
all
this
she
must
yet
add
something
more
substantial
in
the
improvement
of
her
mind
by
extensive
reading
i
am
no
longer
surprised
at
your
knowing
only
six
accomplished
women
i
rather
wonder
now
at
your
knowing
any
are
you
so
severe
upon
your
own
sex
as
to
doubt
the
possibility
of
all
this
i
never
saw
such
a
woman
i
never
saw
such
capacity
and
taste
and
application
and
elegance
as
you
describe
united
mrs
hurst
and
miss
bingley
both
cried
out
against
the
injustice
of
her
implied
doubt
and
were
both
protesting
that
they
knew
many
women
who
answered
this
description
when
mr
hurst
called
them
to
order
with
bitter
complaints
of
their
inattention
to
what
was
going
forward
as
all
conversation
was
thereby
at
an
end
elizabeth
soon
afterwards
left
the
room
elizabeth
bennet
said
miss
bingley
when
the
door
was
closed
on
her
is
one
of
those
young
ladies
who
seek
to
recommend
themselves
to
the
other
sex
by
undervaluing
their
own
and
with
many
men
i
dare
say
it
succeeds
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
paltry
device
a
very
mean
art
undoubtedly
replied
darcy
to
whom
this
remark
was
chiefly
addressed
there
is
a
meanness
in
all
the
arts
which
ladies
sometimes
condescend
to
employ
for
captivation
whatever
bears
affinity
to
cunning
is
despicable
miss
bingley
was
not
so
entirely
satisfied
with
this
reply
as
to
continue
the
subject
elizabeth
joined
them
again
only
to
say
that
her
sister
was
worse
and
that
she
could
not
leave
her
bingley
urged
mr
jones
being
sent
for
immediately
while
his
sisters
convinced
that
no
country
advice
could
be
of
any
service
recommended
an
express
to
town
for
one
of
the
most
eminent
physicians
this
she
would
not
hear
of
but
she
was
not
so
unwilling
to
comply
with
their
brother
s
proposal
and
it
was
settled
that
mr
jones
should
be
sent
for
early
in
the
morning
if
miss
bennet
were
not
decidedly
better
bingley
was
quite
uncomfortable
his
sisters
declared
that
they
were
miserable
they
solaced
their
wretchedness
however
by
duets
after
supper
while
he
could
find
no
better
relief
to
his
feelings
than
by
giving
his
housekeeper
directions
that
every
attention
might
be
paid
to
the
sick
lady
and
her
sister
chapter
9
elizabeth
passed
the
chief
of
the
night
in
her
sister
s
room
and
in
the
morning
had
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
send
a
tolerable
answer
to
the
inquiries
which
she
very
early
received
from
mr
bingley
by
a
housemaid
and
some
time
afterwards
from
the
two
elegant
ladies
who
waited
on
his
sisters
in
spite
of
this
amendment
however
she
requested
to
have
a
note
sent
to
longbourn
desiring
her
mother
to
visit
jane
and
form
her
own
judgement
of
her
situation
the
note
was
immediately
dispatched
and
its
contents
as
quickly
complied
with
mrs
bennet
accompanied
by
her
two
youngest
girls
reached
netherfield
soon
after
the
family
breakfast
had
she
found
jane
in
any
apparent
danger
mrs
bennet
would
have
been
very
miserable
but
being
satisfied
on
seeing
her
that
her
illness
was
not
alarming
she
had
no
wish
of
her
recovering
immediately
as
her
restoration
to
health
would
probably
remove
her
from
netherfield
she
would
not
listen
therefore
to
her
daughter
s
proposal
of
being
carried
home
neither
did
the
apothecary
who
arrived
about
the
same
time
think
it
at
all
advisable
after
sitting
a
little
while
with
jane
on
miss
bingley
s
appearance
and
invitation
the
mother
and
three
daughters
all
attended
her
into
the
breakfast
parlour
bingley
met
them
with
hopes
that
mrs
bennet
had
not
found
miss
bennet
worse
than
she
expected
indeed
i
have
sir
was
her
answer
she
is
a
great
deal
too
ill
to
be
moved
mr
jones
says
we
must
not
think
of
moving
her
we
must
trespass
a
little
longer
on
your
kindness
removed
cried
bingley
it
must
not
be
thought
of
my
sister
i
am
sure
will
not
hear
of
her
removal
you
may
depend
upon
it
madam
said
miss
bingley
with
cold
civility
that
miss
bennet
will
receive
every
possible
attention
while
she
remains
with
us
mrs
bennet
was
profuse
in
her
acknowledgments
i
am
sure
she
added
if
it
was
not
for
such
good
friends
i
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
her
for
she
is
very
ill
indeed
and
suffers
a
vast
deal
though
with
the
greatest
patience
in
the
world
which
is
always
the
way
with
her
for
she
has
without
exception
the
sweetest
temper
i
have
ever
met
with
i
often
tell
my
other
girls
they
are
nothing
to
her
you
have
a
sweet
room
here
mr
bingley
and
a
charming
prospect
over
the
gravel
walk
i
do
not
know
a
place
in
the
country
that
is
equal
to
netherfield
you
will
not
think
of
quitting
it
in
a
hurry
i
hope
though
you
have
but
a
short
lease
whatever
i
do
is
done
in
a
hurry
replied
he
and
therefore
if
i
should
resolve
to
quit
netherfield
i
should
probably
be
off
in
five
minutes
at
present
however
i
consider
myself
as
quite
fixed
here
that
is
exactly
what
i
should
have
supposed
of
you
said
elizabeth
you
begin
to
comprehend
me
do
you
cried
he
turning
towards
her
oh
yes
i
understand
you
perfectly
i
wish
i
might
take
this
for
a
compliment
but
to
be
so
easily
seen
through
i
am
afraid
is
pitiful
that
is
as
it
happens
it
does
not
follow
that
a
deep
intricate
character
is
more
or
less
estimable
than
such
a
one
as
yours
lizzy
cried
her
mother
remember
where
you
are
and
do
not
run
on
in
the
wild
manner
that
you
are
suffered
to
do
at
home
i
did
not
know
before
continued
bingley
immediately
that
you
were
a
studier
of
character
it
must
be
an
amusing
study
yes
but
intricate
characters
are
the
most
amusing
they
have
at
least
that
advantage
the
country
said
darcy
can
in
general
supply
but
a
few
subjects
for
such
a
study
in
a
country
neighbourhood
you
move
in
a
very
confined
and
unvarying
society
but
people
themselves
alter
so
much
that
there
is
something
new
to
be
observed
in
them
for
ever
yes
indeed
cried
mrs
bennet
offended
by
his
manner
of
mentioning
a
country
neighbourhood
i
assure
you
there
is
quite
as
much
of
that
going
on
in
the
country
as
in
town
everybody
was
surprised
and
darcy
after
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
turned
silently
away
mrs
bennet
who
fancied
she
had
gained
a
complete
victory
over
him
continued
her
triumph
i
cannot
see
that
london
has
any
great
advantage
over
the
country
for
my
part
except
the
shops
and
public
places
the
country
is
a
vast
deal
pleasanter
is
it
not
mr
bingley
when
i
am
in
the
country
he
replied
i
never
wish
to
leave
it
and
when
i
am
in
town
it
is
pretty
much
the
same
they
have
each
their
advantages
and
i
can
be
equally
happy
in
either
aye
that
is
because
you
have
the
right
disposition
but
that
gentleman
looking
at
darcy
seemed
to
think
the
country
was
nothing
at
all
indeed
mamma
you
are
mistaken
said
elizabeth
blushing
for
her
mother
you
quite
mistook
mr
darcy
he
only
meant
that
there
was
not
such
a
variety
of
people
to
be
met
with
in
the
country
as
in
the
town
which
you
must
acknowledge
to
be
true
certainly
my
dear
nobody
said
there
were
but
as
to
not
meeting
with
many
people
in
this
neighbourhood
i
believe
there
are
few
neighbourhoods
larger
i
know
we
dine
with
four
and
twenty
families
nothing
but
concern
for
elizabeth
could
enable
bingley
to
keep
his
countenance
his
sister
was
less
delicate
and
directed
her
eyes
towards
mr
darcy
with
a
very
expressive
smile
elizabeth
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
that
might
turn
her
mother
s
thoughts
now
asked
her
if
charlotte
lucas
had
been
at
longbourn
since
her
coming
away
yes
she
called
yesterday
with
her
father
what
an
agreeable
man
sir
william
is
mr
bingley
is
not
he
so
much
the
man
of
fashion
so
genteel
and
easy
he
has
always
something
to
say
to
everybody
that
is
my
idea
of
good
breeding
and
those
persons
who
fancy
themselves
very
important
and
never
open
their
mouths
quite
mistake
the
matter
did
charlotte
dine
with
you
no
she
would
go
home
i
fancy
she
was
wanted
about
the
mince
pies
for
my
part
mr
bingley
i
always
keep
servants
that
can
do
their
own
work
my
daughters
are
brought
up
very
differently
but
everybody
is
to
judge
for
themselves
and
the
lucases
are
a
very
good
sort
of
girls
i
assure
you
it
is
a
pity
they
are
not
handsome
not
that
i
think
charlotte
so
very
plain
but
then
she
is
our
particular
friend
she
seems
a
very
pleasant
young
woman
oh
dear
yes
but
you
must
own
she
is
very
plain
lady
lucas
herself
has
often
said
so
and
envied
me
jane
s
beauty
i
do
not
like
to
boast
of
my
own
child
but
to
be
sure
jane
one
does
not
often
see
anybody
better
looking
it
is
what
everybody
says
i
do
not
trust
my
own
partiality
when
she
was
only
fifteen
there
was
a
man
at
my
brother
gardiner
s
in
town
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
my
sister
in
law
was
sure
he
would
make
her
an
offer
before
we
came
away
but
however
he
did
not
perhaps
he
thought
her
too
young
however
he
wrote
some
verses
on
her
and
very
pretty
they
were
and
so
ended
his
affection
said
elizabeth
impatiently
there
has
been
many
a
one
i
fancy
overcome
in
the
same
way
i
wonder
who
first
discovered
the
efficacy
of
poetry
in
driving
away
love
i
have
been
used
to
consider
poetry
as
the
food
of
love
said
darcy
of
a
fine
stout
healthy
love
it
may
everything
nourishes
what
is
strong
already
but
if
it
be
only
a
slight
thin
sort
of
inclination
i
am
convinced
that
one
good
sonnet
will
starve
it
entirely
away
darcy
only
smiled
and
the
general
pause
which
ensued
made
elizabeth
tremble
lest
her
mother
should
be
exposing
herself
again
she
longed
to
speak
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
and
after
a
short
silence
mrs
bennet
began
repeating
her
thanks
to
mr
bingley
for
his
kindness
to
jane
with
an
apology
for
troubling
him
also
with
lizzy
mr
bingley
was
unaffectedly
civil
in
his
answer
and
forced
his
younger
sister
to
be
civil
also
and
say
what
the
occasion
required
she
performed
her
part
indeed
without
much
graciousness
but
mrs
bennet
was
satisfied
and
soon
afterwards
ordered
her
carriage
upon
this
signal
the
youngest
of
her
daughters
put
herself
forward
the
two
girls
had
been
whispering
to
each
other
during
the
whole
visit
and
the
result
of
it
was
that
the
youngest
should
tax
mr
bingley
with
having
promised
on
his
first
coming
into
the
country
to
give
a
ball
at
netherfield
lydia
was
a
stout
well
grown
girl
of
fifteen
with
a
fine
complexion
and
good
humoured
countenance
a
favourite
with
her
mother
whose
affection
had
brought
her
into
public
at
an
early
age
she
had
high
animal
spirits
and
a
sort
of
natural
self
consequence
which
the
attention
of
the
officers
to
whom
her
uncle
s
good
dinners
and
her
own
easy
manners
recommended
her
had
increased
into
assurance
she
was
very
equal
therefore
to
address
mr
bingley
on
the
subject
of
the
ball
and
abruptly
reminded
him
of
his
promise
adding
that
it
would
be
the
most
shameful
thing
in
the
world
if
he
did
not
keep
it
his
answer
to
this
sudden
attack
was
delightful
to
their
mother
s
ear
i
am
perfectly
ready
i
assure
you
to
keep
my
engagement
and
when
your
sister
is
recovered
you
shall
if
you
please
name
the
very
day
of
the
ball
but
you
would
not
wish
to
be
dancing
when
she
is
ill
lydia
declared
herself
satisfied
oh
yes
it
would
be
much
better
to
wait
till
jane
was
well
and
by
that
time
most
likely
captain
carter
would
be
at
meryton
again
and
when
you
have
given
your
ball
she
added
i
shall
insist
on
their
giving
one
also
i
shall
tell
colonel
forster
it
will
be
quite
a
shame
if
he
does
not
mrs
bennet
and
her
daughters
then
departed
and
elizabeth
returned
instantly
to
jane
leaving
her
own
and
her
relations
behaviour
to
the
remarks
of
the
two
ladies
and
mr
darcy
the
latter
of
whom
however
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
join
in
their
censure
of
her
in
spite
of
all
miss
bingley
s
witticisms
on
fine
eyes
chapter
10
the
day
passed
much
as
the
day
before
had
done
mrs
hurst
and
miss
bingley
had
spent
some
hours
of
the
morning
with
the
invalid
who
continued
though
slowly
to
mend
and
in
the
evening
elizabeth
joined
their
party
in
the
drawing
room
the
loo
table
however
did
not
appear
mr
darcy
was
writing
and
miss
bingley
seated
near
him
was
watching
the
progress
of
his
letter
and
repeatedly
calling
off
his
attention
by
messages
to
his
sister
mr
hurst
and
mr
bingley
were
at
piquet
and
mrs
hurst
was
observing
their
game
elizabeth
took
up
some
needlework
and
was
sufficiently
amused
in
attending
to
what
passed
between
darcy
and
his
companion
the
perpetual
commendations
of
the
lady
either
on
his
handwriting
or
on
the
evenness
of
his
lines
or
on
the
length
of
his
letter
with
the
perfect
unconcern
with
which
her
praises
were
received
formed
a
curious
dialogue
and
was
exactly
in
union
with
her
opinion
of
each
how
delighted
miss
darcy
will
be
to
receive
such
a
letter
he
made
no
answer
you
write
uncommonly
fast
you
are
mistaken
i
write
rather
slowly
how
many
letters
you
must
have
occasion
to
write
in
the
course
of
a
year
letters
of
business
too
how
odious
i
should
think
them
it
is
fortunate
then
that
they
fall
to
my
lot
instead
of
yours
pray
tell
your
sister
that
i
long
to
see
her
i
have
already
told
her
so
once
by
your
desire
i
am
afraid
you
do
not
like
your
pen
let
me
mend
it
for
you
i
mend
pens
remarkably
well
thank
you
but
i
always
mend
my
own
how
can
you
contrive
to
write
so
even
he
was
silent
tell
your
sister
i
am
delighted
to
hear
of
her
improvement
on
the
harp
and
pray
let
her
know
that
i
am
quite
in
raptures
with
her
beautiful
little
design
for
a
table
and
i
think
it
infinitely
superior
to
miss
grantley
s
will
you
give
me
leave
to
defer
your
raptures
till
i
write
again
at
present
i
have
not
room
to
do
them
justice
oh
it
is
of
no
consequence
i
shall
see
her
in
january
but
do
you
always
write
such
charming
long
letters
to
her
mr
darcy
they
are
generally
long
but
whether
always
charming
it
is
not
for
me
to
determine
it
is
a
rule
with
me
that
a
person
who
can
write
a
long
letter
with
ease
cannot
write
ill
that
will
not
do
for
a
compliment
to
darcy
caroline
cried
her
brother
because
he
does
not
write
with
ease
he
studies
too
much
for
words
of
four
syllables
do
not
you
darcy
my
style
of
writing
is
very
different
from
yours
oh
cried
miss
bingley
charles
writes
in
the
most
careless
way
imaginable
he
leaves
out
half
his
words
and
blots
the
rest
my
ideas
flow
so
rapidly
that
i
have
not
time
to
express
them
by
which
means
my
letters
sometimes
convey
no
ideas
at
all
to
my
correspondents
your
humility
mr
bingley
said
elizabeth
must
disarm
reproof
nothing
is
more
deceitful
said
darcy
than
the
appearance
of
humility
it
is
often
only
carelessness
of
opinion
and
sometimes
an
indirect
boast
and
which
of
the
two
do
you
call
my
little
recent
piece
of
modesty
the
indirect
boast
for
you
are
really
proud
of
your
defects
in
writing
because
you
consider
them
as
proceeding
from
a
rapidity
of
thought
and
carelessness
of
execution
which
if
not
estimable
you
think
at
least
highly
interesting
the
power
of
doing
anything
with
quickness
is
always
prized
much
by
the
possessor
and
often
without
any
attention
to
the
imperfection
of
the
performance
when
you
told
mrs
bennet
this
morning
that
if
you
ever
resolved
upon
quitting
netherfield
you
should
be
gone
in
five
minutes
you
meant
it
to
be
a
sort
of
panegyric
of
compliment
to
yourself
and
yet
what
is
there
so
very
laudable
in
a
precipitance
which
must
leave
very
necessary
business
undone
and
can
be
of
no
real
advantage
to
yourself
or
anyone
else
nay
cried
bingley
this
is
too
much
to
remember
at
night
all
the
foolish
things
that
were
said
in
the
morning
and
yet
upon
my
honour
i
believe
what
i
said
of
myself
to
be
true
and
i
believe
it
at
this
moment
at
least
therefore
i
did
not
assume
the
character
of
needless
precipitance
merely
to
show
off
before
the
ladies
i
dare
say
you
believed
it
but
i
am
by
no
means
convinced
that
you
would
be
gone
with
such
celerity
your
conduct
would
be
quite
as
dependent
on
chance
as
that
of
any
man
i
know
and
if
as
you
were
mounting
your
horse
a
friend
were
to
say
bingley
you
had
better
stay
till
next
week
you
would
probably
do
it
you
would
probably
not
go
and
at
another
word
might
stay
a
month
you
have
only
proved
by
this
cried
elizabeth
that
mr
bingley
did
not
do
justice
to
his
own
disposition
you
have
shown
him
off
now
much
more
than
he
did
himself
i
am
exceedingly
gratified
said
bingley
by
your
converting
what
my
friend
says
into
a
compliment
on
the
sweetness
of
my
temper
but
i
am
afraid
you
are
giving
it
a
turn
which
that
gentleman
did
by
no
means
intend
for
he
would
certainly
think
better
of
me
if
under
such
a
circumstance
i
were
to
give
a
flat
denial
and
ride
off
as
fast
as
i
could
would
mr
darcy
then
consider
the
rashness
of
your
original
intentions
as
atoned
for
by
your
obstinacy
in
adhering
to
it
upon
my
word
i
cannot
exactly
explain
the
matter
darcy
must
speak
for
himself
you
expect
me
to
account
for
opinions
which
you
choose
to
call
mine
but
which
i
have
never
acknowledged
allowing
the
case
however
to
stand
according
to
your
representation
you
must
remember
miss
bennet
that
the
friend
who
is
supposed
to
desire
his
return
to
the
house
and
the
delay
of
his
plan
has
merely
desired
it
asked
it
without
offering
one
argument
in
favour
of
its
propriety
to
yield
readily
easily
to
the
persuasion
of
a
friend
is
no
merit
with
you
to
yield
without
conviction
is
no
compliment
to
the
understanding
of
either
you
appear
to
me
mr
darcy
to
allow
nothing
for
the
influence
of
friendship
and
affection
a
regard
for
the
requester
would
often
make
one
readily
yield
to
a
request
without
waiting
for
arguments
to
reason
one
into
it
i
am
not
particularly
speaking
of
such
a
case
as
you
have
supposed
about
mr
bingley
we
may
as
well
wait
perhaps
till
the
circumstance
occurs
before
we
discuss
the
discretion
of
his
behaviour
thereupon
but
in
general
and
ordinary
cases
between
friend
and
friend
where
one
of
them
is
desired
by
the
other
to
change
a
resolution
of
no
very
great
moment
should
you
think
ill
of
that
person
for
complying
with
the
desire
without
waiting
to
be
argued
into
it
will
it
not
be
advisable
before
we
proceed
on
this
subject
to
arrange
with
rather
more
precision
the
degree
of
importance
which
is
to
appertain
to
this
request
as
well
as
the
degree
of
intimacy
subsisting
between
the
parties
by
all
means
cried
bingley
let
us
hear
all
the
particulars
not
forgetting
their
comparative
height
and
size
for
that
will
have
more
weight
in
the
argument
miss
bennet
than
you
may
be
aware
of
i
assure
you
that
if
darcy
were
not
such
a
great
tall
fellow
in
comparison
with
myself
i
should
not
pay
him
half
so
much
deference
i
declare
i
do
not
know
a
more
awful
object
than
darcy
on
particular
occasions
and
in
particular
places
at
his
own
house
especially
and
of
a
sunday
evening
when
he
has
nothing
to
do
mr
darcy
smiled
but
elizabeth
thought
she
could
perceive
that
he
was
rather
offended
and
therefore
checked
her
laugh
miss
bingley
warmly
resented
the
indignity
he
had
received
in
an
expostulation
with
her
brother
for
talking
such
nonsense
i
see
your
design
bingley
said
his
friend
you
dislike
an
argument
and
want
to
silence
this
perhaps
i
do
arguments
are
too
much
like
disputes
if
you
and
miss
bennet
will
defer
yours
till
i
am
out
of
the
room
i
shall
be
very
thankful
and
then
you
may
say
whatever
you
like
of
me
what
you
ask
said
elizabeth
is
no
sacrifice
on
my
side
and
mr
darcy
had
much
better
finish
his
letter
mr
darcy
took
her
advice
and
did
finish
his
letter
when
that
business
was
over
he
applied
to
miss
bingley
and
elizabeth
for
an
indulgence
of
some
music
miss
bingley
moved
with
some
alacrity
to
the
pianoforte
and
after
a
polite
request
that
elizabeth
would
lead
the
way
which
the
other
as
politely
and
more
earnestly
negatived
she
seated
herself
mrs
hurst
sang
with
her
sister
and
while
they
were
thus
employed
elizabeth
could
not
help
observing
as
she
turned
over
some
music
books
that
lay
on
the
instrument
how
frequently
mr
darcy
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
she
hardly
knew
how
to
suppose
that
she
could
be
an
object
of
admiration
to
so
great
a
man
and
yet
that
he
should
look
at
her
because
he
disliked
her
was
still
more
strange
she
could
only
imagine
however
at
last
that
she
drew
his
notice
because
there
was
something
more
wrong
and
reprehensible
according
to
his
ideas
of
right
than
in
any
other
person
present
the
supposition
did
not
pain
her
she
liked
him
too
little
to
care
for
his
approbation
after
playing
some
italian
songs
miss
bingley
varied
the
charm
by
a
lively
scotch
air
and
soon
afterwards
mr
darcy
drawing
near
elizabeth
said
to
her
do
not
you
feel
a
great
inclination
miss
bennet
to
seize
such
an
opportunity
of
dancing
a
reel
she
smiled
but
made
no
answer
he
repeated
the
question
with
some
surprise
at
her
silence
oh
said
she
i
heard
you
before
but
i
could
not
immediately
determine
what
to
say
in
reply
you
wanted
me
i
know
to
say
yes
that
you
might
have
the
pleasure
of
despising
my
taste
but
i
always
delight
in
overthrowing
those
kind
of
schemes
and
cheating
a
person
of
their
premeditated
contempt
i
have
therefore
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
that
i
do
not
want
to
dance
a
reel
at
all
and
now
despise
me
if
you
dare
indeed
i
do
not
dare
elizabeth
having
rather
expected
to
affront
him
was
amazed
at
his
gallantry
but
there
was
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
archness
in
her
manner
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
affront
anybody
and
darcy
had
never
been
so
bewitched
by
any
woman
as
he
was
by
her
he
really
believed
that
were
it
not
for
the
inferiority
of
her
connections
he
should
be
in
some
danger
miss
bingley
saw
or
suspected
enough
to
be
jealous
and
her
great
anxiety
for
the
recovery
of
her
dear
friend
jane
received
some
assistance
from
her
desire
of
getting
rid
of
elizabeth
she
often
tried
to
provoke
darcy
into
disliking
her
guest
by
talking
of
their
supposed
marriage
and
planning
his
happiness
in
such
an
alliance
i
hope
said
she
as
they
were
walking
together
in
the
shrubbery
the
next
day
you
will
give
your
mother
in
law
a
few
hints
when
this
desirable
event
takes
place
as
to
the
advantage
of
holding
her
tongue
and
if
you
can
compass
it
do
cure
the
younger
girls
of
running
after
officers
and
if
i
may
mention
so
delicate
a
subject
endeavour
to
check
that
little
something
bordering
on
conceit
and
impertinence
which
your
lady
possesses
have
you
anything
else
to
propose
for
my
domestic
felicity
oh
yes
do
let
the
portraits
of
your
uncle
and
aunt
phillips
be
placed
in
the
gallery
at
pemberley
put
them
next
to
your
great
uncle
the
judge
they
are
in
the
same
profession
you
know
only
in
different
lines
as
for
your
elizabeth
s
picture
you
must
not
have
it
taken
for
what
painter
could
do
justice
to
those
beautiful
eyes
it
would
not
be
easy
indeed
to
catch
their
expression
but
their
colour
and
shape
and
the
eyelashes
so
remarkably
fine
might
be
copied
at
that
moment
they
were
met
from
another
walk
by
mrs
hurst
and
elizabeth
herself
i
did
not
know
that
you
intended
to
walk
said
miss
bingley
in
some
confusion
lest
they
had
been
overheard
you
used
us
abominably
ill
answered
mrs
hurst
running
away
without
telling
us
that
you
were
coming
out
then
taking
the
disengaged
arm
of
mr
darcy
she
left
elizabeth
to
walk
by
herself
the
path
just
admitted
three
mr
darcy
felt
their
rudeness
and
immediately
said
this
walk
is
not
wide
enough
for
our
party
we
had
better
go
into
the
avenue
but
elizabeth
who
had
not
the
least
inclination
to
remain
with
them
laughingly
answered
no
no
stay
where
you
are
you
are
charmingly
grouped
and
appear
to
uncommon
advantage
the
picturesque
would
be
spoilt
by
admitting
a
fourth
good
bye
she
then
ran
gaily
off
rejoicing
as
she
rambled
about
in
the
hope
of
being
at
home
again
in
a
day
or
two
jane
was
already
so
much
recovered
as
to
intend
leaving
her
room
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
evening
chapter
11
when
the
ladies
removed
after
dinner
elizabeth
ran
up
to
her
sister
and
seeing
her
well
guarded
from
cold
attended
her
into
the
drawing
room
where
she
was
welcomed
by
her
two
friends
with
many
professions
of
pleasure
and
elizabeth
had
never
seen
them
so
agreeable
as
they
were
during
the
hour
which
passed
before
the
gentlemen
appeared
their
powers
of
conversation
were
considerable
they
could
describe
an
entertainment
with
accuracy
relate
an
anecdote
with
humour
and
laugh
at
their
acquaintance
with
spirit
but
when
the
gentlemen
entered
jane
was
no
longer
the
first
object
miss
bingley
s
eyes
were
instantly
turned
toward
darcy
and
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
before
he
had
advanced
many
steps
he
addressed
himself
to
miss
bennet
with
a
polite
congratulation
mr
hurst
also
made
her
a
slight
bow
and
said
he
was
very
glad
but
diffuseness
and
warmth
remained
for
bingley
s
salutation
he
was
full
of
joy
and
attention
the
first
half
hour
was
spent
in
piling
up
the
fire
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
change
of
room
and
she
removed
at
his
desire
to
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
that
she
might
be
further
from
the
door
he
then
sat
down
by
her
and
talked
scarcely
to
anyone
else
elizabeth
at
work
in
the
opposite
corner
saw
it
all
with
great
delight
when
tea
was
over
mr
hurst
reminded
his
sister
in
law
of
the
card
table
but
in
vain
she
had
obtained
private
intelligence
that
mr
darcy
did
not
wish
for
cards
and
mr
hurst
soon
found
even
his
open
petition
rejected
she
assured
him
that
no
one
intended
to
play
and
the
silence
of
the
whole
party
on
the
subject
seemed
to
justify
her
mr
hurst
had
therefore
nothing
to
do
but
to
stretch
himself
on
one
of
the
sofas
and
go
to
sleep
darcy
took
up
a
book
miss
bingley
did
the
same
and
mrs
hurst
principally
occupied
in
playing
with
her
bracelets
and
rings
joined
now
and
then
in
her
brother
s
conversation
with
miss
bennet
miss
bingley
s
attention
was
quite
as
much
engaged
in
watching
mr
darcy
s
progress
through
his
book
as
in
reading
her
own
and
she
was
perpetually
either
making
some
inquiry
or
looking
at
his
page
she
could
not
win
him
however
to
any
conversation
he
merely
answered
her
question
and
read
on
at
length
quite
exhausted
by
the
attempt
to
be
amused
with
her
own
book
which
she
had
only
chosen
because
it
was
the
second
volume
of
his
she
gave
a
great
yawn
and
said
how
pleasant
it
is
to
spend
an
evening
in
this
way
i
declare
after
all
there
is
no
enjoyment
like
reading
how
much
sooner
one
tires
of
anything
than
of
a
book
when
i
have
a
house
of
my
own
i
shall
be
miserable
if
i
have
not
an
excellent
library
no
one
made
any
reply
she
then
yawned
again
threw
aside
her
book
and
cast
her
eyes
round
the
room
in
quest
for
some
amusement
when
hearing
her
brother
mentioning
a
ball
to
miss
bennet
she
turned
suddenly
towards
him
and
said
by
the
bye
charles
are
you
really
serious
in
meditating
a
dance
at
netherfield
i
would
advise
you
before
you
determine
on
it
to
consult
the
wishes
of
the
present
party
i
am
much
mistaken
if
there
are
not
some
among
us
to
whom
a
ball
would
be
rather
a
punishment
than
a
pleasure
if
you
mean
darcy
cried
her
brother
he
may
go
to
bed
if
he
chooses
before
it
begins
but
as
for
the
ball
it
is
quite
a
settled
thing
and
as
soon
as
nicholls
has
made
white
soup
enough
i
shall
send
round
my
cards
i
should
like
balls
infinitely
better
she
replied
if
they
were
carried
on
in
a
different
manner
but
there
is
something
insufferably
tedious
in
the
usual
process
of
such
a
meeting
it
would
surely
be
much
more
rational
if
conversation
instead
of
dancing
were
made
the
order
of
the
day
much
more
rational
my
dear
caroline
i
dare
say
but
it
would
not
be
near
so
much
like
a
ball
miss
bingley
made
no
answer
and
soon
afterwards
she
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
her
figure
was
elegant
and
she
walked
well
but
darcy
at
whom
it
was
all
aimed
was
still
inflexibly
studious
in
the
desperation
of
her
feelings
she
resolved
on
one
effort
more
and
turning
to
elizabeth
said
miss
eliza
bennet
let
me
persuade
you
to
follow
my
example
and
take
a
turn
about
the
room
i
assure
you
it
is
very
refreshing
after
sitting
so
long
in
one
attitude
elizabeth
was
surprised
but
agreed
to
it
immediately
miss
bingley
succeeded
no
less
in
the
real
object
of
her
civility
mr
darcy
looked
up
he
was
as
much
awake
to
the
novelty
of
attention
in
that
quarter
as
elizabeth
herself
could
be
and
unconsciously
closed
his
book
he
was
directly
invited
to
join
their
party
but
he
declined
it
observing
that
he
could
imagine
but
two
motives
for
their
choosing
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
together
with
either
of
which
motives
his
joining
them
would
interfere
what
could
he
mean
she
was
dying
to
know
what
could
be
his
meaning
and
asked
elizabeth
whether
she
could
at
all
understand
him
not
at
all
was
her
answer
but
depend
upon
it
he
means
to
be
severe
on
us
and
our
surest
way
of
disappointing
him
will
be
to
ask
nothing
about
it
miss
bingley
however
was
incapable
of
disappointing
mr
darcy
in
anything
and
persevered
therefore
in
requiring
an
explanation
of
his
two
motives
i
have
not
the
smallest
objection
to
explaining
them
said
he
as
soon
as
she
allowed
him
to
speak
you
either
choose
this
method
of
passing
the
evening
because
you
are
in
each
other
s
confidence
and
have
secret
affairs
to
discuss
or
because
you
are
conscious
that
your
figures
appear
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
walking
if
the
first
i
would
be
completely
in
your
way
and
if
the
second
i
can
admire
you
much
better
as
i
sit
by
the
fire
oh
shocking
cried
miss
bingley
i
never
heard
anything
so
abominable
how
shall
we
punish
him
for
such
a
speech
nothing
so
easy
if
you
have
but
the
inclination
said
elizabeth
we
can
all
plague
and
punish
one
another
tease
him
laugh
at
him
intimate
as
you
are
you
must
know
how
it
is
to
be
done
but
upon
my
honour
i
do
not
i
do
assure
you
that
my
intimacy
has
not
yet
taught
me
that
tease
calmness
of
manner
and
presence
of
mind
no
no
i
feel
he
may
defy
us
there
and
as
to
laughter
we
will
not
expose
ourselves
if
you
please
by
attempting
to
laugh
without
a
subject
mr
darcy
may
hug
himself
mr
darcy
is
not
to
be
laughed
at
cried
elizabeth
that
is
an
uncommon
advantage
and
uncommon
i
hope
it
will
continue
for
it
would
be
a
great
loss
to
me
to
have
many
such
acquaintances
i
dearly
love
a
laugh
miss
bingley
said
he
has
given
me
more
credit
than
can
be
the
wisest
and
the
best
of
men
nay
the
wisest
and
best
of
their
actions
may
be
rendered
ridiculous
by
a
person
whose
first
object
in
life
is
a
joke
certainly
replied
elizabeth
there
are
such
people
but
i
hope
i
am
not
one
of
them
i
hope
i
never
ridicule
what
is
wise
and
good
follies
and
nonsense
whims
and
inconsistencies
do
divert
me
i
own
and
i
laugh
at
them
whenever
i
can
but
these
i
suppose
are
precisely
what
you
are
without
perhaps
that
is
not
possible
for
anyone
but
it
has
been
the
study
of
my
life
to
avoid
those
weaknesses
which
often
expose
a
strong
understanding
to
ridicule
such
as
vanity
and
pride
yes
vanity
is
a
weakness
indeed
but
pride
where
there
is
a
real
superiority
of
mind
pride
will
be
always
under
good
regulation
elizabeth
turned
away
to
hide
a
smile
your
examination
of
mr
darcy
is
over
i
presume
said
miss
bingley
and
pray
what
is
the
result
i
am
perfectly
convinced
by
it
that
mr
darcy
has
no
defect
he
owns
it
himself
without
disguise
no
said
darcy
i
have
made
no
such
pretension
i
have
faults
enough
but
they
are
not
i
hope
of
understanding
my
temper
i
dare
not
vouch
for
it
is
i
believe
too
little
yielding
certainly
too
little
for
the
convenience
of
the
world
i
cannot
forget
the
follies
and
vices
of
others
so
soon
as
i
ought
nor
their
offenses
against
myself
my
feelings
are
not
puffed
about
with
every
attempt
to
move
them
my
temper
would
perhaps
be
called
resentful
my
good
opinion
once
lost
is
lost
forever
that
is
a
failing
indeed
cried
elizabeth
implacable
resentment
is
a
shade
in
a
character
but
you
have
chosen
your
fault
well
i
really
cannot
laugh
at
it
you
are
safe
from
me
there
is
i
believe
in
every
disposition
a
tendency
to
some
particular
evil
a
natural
defect
which
not
even
the
best
education
can
overcome
and
your
defect
is
to
hate
everybody
and
yours
he
replied
with
a
smile
is
willfully
to
misunderstand
them
do
let
us
have
a
little
music
cried
miss
bingley
tired
of
a
conversation
in
which
she
had
no
share
louisa
you
will
not
mind
my
waking
mr
hurst
her
sister
had
not
the
smallest
objection
and
the
pianoforte
was
opened
and
darcy
after
a
few
moments
recollection
was
not
sorry
for
it
he
began
to
feel
the
danger
of
paying
elizabeth
too
much
attention
chapter
12
in
consequence
of
an
agreement
between
the
sisters
elizabeth
wrote
the
next
morning
to
their
mother
to
beg
that
the
carriage
might
be
sent
for
them
in
the
course
of
the
day
but
mrs
bennet
who
had
calculated
on
her
daughters
remaining
at
netherfield
till
the
following
tuesday
which
would
exactly
finish
jane
s
week
could
not
bring
herself
to
receive
them
with
pleasure
before
her
answer
therefore
was
not
propitious
at
least
not
to
elizabeth
s
wishes
for
she
was
impatient
to
get
home
mrs
bennet
sent
them
word
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
the
carriage
before
tuesday
and
in
her
postscript
it
was
added
that
if
mr
bingley
and
his
sister
pressed
them
to
stay
longer
she
could
spare
them
very
well
against
staying
longer
however
elizabeth
was
positively
resolved
nor
did
she
much
expect
it
would
be
asked
and
fearful
on
the
contrary
as
being
considered
as
intruding
themselves
needlessly
long
she
urged
jane
to
borrow
mr
bingley
s
carriage
immediately
and
at
length
it
was
settled
that
their
original
design
of
leaving
netherfield
that
morning
should
be
mentioned
and
the
request
made
the
communication
excited
many
professions
of
concern
and
enough
was
said
of
wishing
them
to
stay
at
least
till
the
following
day
to
work
on
jane
and
till
the
morrow
their
going
was
deferred
miss
bingley
was
then
sorry
that
she
had
proposed
the
delay
for
her
jealousy
and
dislike
of
one
sister
much
exceeded
her
affection
for
the
other
the
master
of
the
house
heard
with
real
sorrow
that
they
were
to
go
so
soon
and
repeatedly
tried
to
persuade
miss
bennet
that
it
would
not
be
safe
for
her
that
she
was
not
enough
recovered
but
jane
was
firm
where
she
felt
herself
to
be
right
to
mr
darcy
it
was
welcome
intelligence
elizabeth
had
been
at
netherfield
long
enough
she
attracted
him
more
than
he
liked
and
miss
bingley
was
uncivil
to
her
and
more
teasing
than
usual
to
himself
he
wisely
resolved
to
be
particularly
careful
that
no
sign
of
admiration
should
now
escape
him
nothing
that
could
elevate
her
with
the
hope
of
influencing
his
felicity
sensible
that
if
such
an
idea
had
been
suggested
his
behaviour
during
the
last
day
must
have
material
weight
in
confirming
or
crushing
it
steady
to
his
purpose
he
scarcely
spoke
ten
words
to
her
through
the
whole
of
saturday
and
though
they
were
at
one
time
left
by
themselves
for
half
an
hour
he
adhered
most
conscientiously
to
his
book
and
would
not
even
look
at
her
on
sunday
after
morning
service
the
separation
so
agreeable
to
almost
all
took
place
miss
bingley
s
civility
to
elizabeth
increased
at
last
very
rapidly
as
well
as
her
affection
for
jane
and
when
they
parted
after
assuring
the
latter
of
the
pleasure
it
would
always
give
her
to
see
her
either
at
longbourn
or
netherfield
and
embracing
her
most
tenderly
she
even
shook
hands
with
the
former
elizabeth
took
leave
of
the
whole
party
in
the
liveliest
of
spirits
they
were
not
welcomed
home
very
cordially
by
their
mother
mrs
bennet
wondered
at
their
coming
and
thought
them
very
wrong
to
give
so
much
trouble
and
was
sure
jane
would
have
caught
cold
again
but
their
father
though
very
laconic
in
his
expressions
of
pleasure
was
really
glad
to
see
them
he
had
felt
their
importance
in
the
family
circle
the
evening
conversation
when
they
were
all
assembled
had
lost
much
of
its
animation
and
almost
all
its
sense
by
the
absence
of
jane
and
elizabeth
they
found
mary
as
usual
deep
in
the
study
of
thorough
bass
and
human
nature
and
had
some
extracts
to
admire
and
some
new
observations
of
threadbare
morality
to
listen
to
catherine
and
lydia
had
information
for
them
of
a
different
sort
much
had
been
done
and
much
had
been
said
in
the
regiment
since
the
preceding
wednesday
several
of
the
officers
had
dined
lately
with
their
uncle
a
private
had
been
flogged
and
it
had
actually
been
hinted
that
colonel
forster
was
going
to
be
married

i
hope
my
dear
said
mr
bennet
to
his
wife
as
they
were
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
that
you
have
ordered
a
good
dinner
to
day
because
i
have
reason
to
expect
an
addition
to
our
family
party
who
do
you
mean
my
dear
i
know
of
nobody
that
is
coming
i
am
sure
unless
charlotte
lucas
should
happen
to
call
in
and
i
hope
my
dinners
are
good
enough
for
her
i
do
not
believe
she
often
sees
such
at
home
the
person
of
whom
i
speak
is
a
gentleman
and
a
stranger
mrs
bennet
s
eyes
sparkled
a
gentleman
and
a
stranger
it
is
mr
bingley
i
am
sure
well
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
extremely
glad
to
see
mr
bingley
but
good
lord
how
unlucky
there
is
not
a
bit
of
fish
to
be
got
to
day
lydia
my
love
ring
the
bell
i
must
speak
to
hill
this
moment
it
is
not
mr
bingley
said
her
husband
it
is
a
person
whom
i
never
saw
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
this
roused
a
general
astonishment
and
he
had
the
pleasure
of
being
eagerly
questioned
by
his
wife
and
his
five
daughters
at
once
after
amusing
himself
some
time
with
their
curiosity
he
thus
explained
about
a
month
ago
i
received
this
letter
and
about
a
fortnight
ago
i
answered
it
for
i
thought
it
a
case
of
some
delicacy
and
requiring
early
attention
it
is
from
my
cousin
mr
collins
who
when
i
am
dead
may
turn
you
all
out
of
this
house
as
soon
as
he
pleases
oh
my
dear
cried
his
wife
i
cannot
bear
to
hear
that
mentioned
pray
do
not
talk
of
that
odious
man
i
do
think
it
is
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world
that
your
estate
should
be
entailed
away
from
your
own
children
and
i
am
sure
if
i
had
been
you
i
should
have
tried
long
ago
to
do
something
or
other
about
it
jane
and
elizabeth
tried
to
explain
to
her
the
nature
of
an
entail
they
had
often
attempted
to
do
it
before
but
it
was
a
subject
on
which
mrs
bennet
was
beyond
the
reach
of
reason
and
she
continued
to
rail
bitterly
against
the
cruelty
of
settling
an
estate
away
from
a
family
of
five
daughters
in
favour
of
a
man
whom
nobody
cared
anything
about
it
certainly
is
a
most
iniquitous
affair
said
mr
bennet
and
nothing
can
clear
mr
collins
from
the
guilt
of
inheriting
longbourn
but
if
you
will
listen
to
his
letter
you
may
perhaps
be
a
little
softened
by
his
manner
of
expressing
himself
no
that
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
and
i
think
it
is
very
impertinent
of
him
to
write
to
you
at
all
and
very
hypocritical
i
hate
such
false
friends
why
could
he
not
keep
on
quarreling
with
you
as
his
father
did
before
him
why
indeed
he
does
seem
to
have
had
some
filial
scruples
on
that
head
as
you
will
hear
hunsford
near
westerham
kent
15th
october
dear
sir
the
disagreement
subsisting
between
yourself
and
my
late
honoured
father
always
gave
me
much
uneasiness
and
since
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
him
i
have
frequently
wished
to
heal
the
breach
but
for
some
time
i
was
kept
back
by
my
own
doubts
fearing
lest
it
might
seem
disrespectful
to
his
memory
for
me
to
be
on
good
terms
with
anyone
with
whom
it
had
always
pleased
him
to
be
at
variance
there
mrs
bennet
my
mind
however
is
now
made
up
on
the
subject
for
having
received
ordination
at
easter
i
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
be
distinguished
by
the
patronage
of
the
right
honourable
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
widow
of
sir
lewis
de
bourgh
whose
bounty
and
beneficence
has
preferred
me
to
the
valuable
rectory
of
this
parish
where
it
shall
be
my
earnest
endeavour
to
demean
myself
with
grateful
respect
towards
her
ladyship
and
be
ever
ready
to
perform
those
rites
and
ceremonies
which
are
instituted
by
the
church
of
england
as
a
clergyman
moreover
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
promote
and
establish
the
blessing
of
peace
in
all
families
within
the
reach
of
my
influence
and
on
these
grounds
i
flatter
myself
that
my
present
overtures
are
highly
commendable
and
that
the
circumstance
of
my
being
next
in
the
entail
of
longbourn
estate
will
be
kindly
overlooked
on
your
side
and
not
lead
you
to
reject
the
offered
olive
branch
i
cannot
be
otherwise
than
concerned
at
being
the
means
of
injuring
your
amiable
daughters
and
beg
leave
to
apologise
for
it
as
well
as
to
assure
you
of
my
readiness
to
make
them
every
possible
amends
but
of
this
hereafter
if
you
should
have
no
objection
to
receive
me
into
your
house
i
propose
myself
the
satisfaction
of
waiting
on
you
and
your
family
monday
november
18th
by
four
o
clock
and
shall
probably
trespass
on
your
hospitality
till
the
saturday
se
ennight
following
which
i
can
do
without
any
inconvenience
as
lady
catherine
is
far
from
objecting
to
my
occasional
absence
on
a
sunday
provided
that
some
other
clergyman
is
engaged
to
do
the
duty
of
the
day
i
remain
dear
sir
with
respectful
compliments
to
your
lady
and
daughters
your
well
wisher
and
friend
william
collins
at
four
o
clock
therefore
we
may
expect
this
peace
making
gentleman
said
mr
bennet
as
he
folded
up
the
letter
he
seems
to
be
a
most
conscientious
and
polite
young
man
upon
my
word
and
i
doubt
not
will
prove
a
valuable
acquaintance
especially
if
lady
catherine
should
be
so
indulgent
as
to
let
him
come
to
us
again
there
is
some
sense
in
what
he
says
about
the
girls
however
and
if
he
is
disposed
to
make
them
any
amends
i
shall
not
be
the
person
to
discourage
him
though
it
is
difficult
said
jane
to
guess
in
what
way
he
can
mean
to
make
us
the
atonement
he
thinks
our
due
the
wish
is
certainly
to
his
credit
elizabeth
was
chiefly
struck
by
his
extraordinary
deference
for
lady
catherine
and
his
kind
intention
of
christening
marrying
and
burying
his
parishioners
whenever
it
were
required
he
must
be
an
oddity
i
think
said
she
i
cannot
make
him
out
there
is
something
very
pompous
in
his
style
and
what
can
he
mean
by
apologising
for
being
next
in
the
entail
we
cannot
suppose
he
would
help
it
if
he
could
could
he
be
a
sensible
man
sir
no
my
dear
i
think
not
i
have
great
hopes
of
finding
him
quite
the
reverse
there
is
a
mixture
of
servility
and
self
importance
in
his
letter
which
promises
well
i
am
impatient
to
see
him
in
point
of
composition
said
mary
the
letter
does
not
seem
defective
the
idea
of
the
olive
branch
perhaps
is
not
wholly
new
yet
i
think
it
is
well
expressed
to
catherine
and
lydia
neither
the
letter
nor
its
writer
were
in
any
degree
interesting
it
was
next
to
impossible
that
their
cousin
should
come
in
a
scarlet
coat
and
it
was
now
some
weeks
since
they
had
received
pleasure
from
the
society
of
a
man
in
any
other
colour
as
for
their
mother
mr
collins
s
letter
had
done
away
much
of
her
ill
will
and
she
was
preparing
to
see
him
with
a
degree
of
composure
which
astonished
her
husband
and
daughters
mr
collins
was
punctual
to
his
time
and
was
received
with
great
politeness
by
the
whole
family
mr
bennet
indeed
said
little
but
the
ladies
were
ready
enough
to
talk
and
mr
collins
seemed
neither
in
need
of
encouragement
nor
inclined
to
be
silent
himself
he
was
a
tall
heavy
looking
young
man
of
five
and
twenty
his
air
was
grave
and
stately
and
his
manners
were
very
formal
he
had
not
been
long
seated
before
he
complimented
mrs
bennet
on
having
so
fine
a
family
of
daughters
said
he
had
heard
much
of
their
beauty
but
that
in
this
instance
fame
had
fallen
short
of
the
truth
and
added
that
he
did
not
doubt
her
seeing
them
all
in
due
time
disposed
of
in
marriage
this
gallantry
was
not
much
to
the
taste
of
some
of
his
hearers
but
mrs
bennet
who
quarreled
with
no
compliments
answered
most
readily
you
are
very
kind
i
am
sure
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
may
prove
so
for
else
they
will
be
destitute
enough
things
are
settled
so
oddly
you
allude
perhaps
to
the
entail
of
this
estate
ah
sir
i
do
indeed
it
is
a
grievous
affair
to
my
poor
girls
you
must
confess
not
that
i
mean
to
find
fault
with
you
for
such
things
i
know
are
all
chance
in
this
world
there
is
no
knowing
how
estates
will
go
when
once
they
come
to
be
entailed
i
am
very
sensible
madam
of
the
hardship
to
my
fair
cousins
and
could
say
much
on
the
subject
but
that
i
am
cautious
of
appearing
forward
and
precipitate
but
i
can
assure
the
young
ladies
that
i
come
prepared
to
admire
them
at
present
i
will
not
say
more
but
perhaps
when
we
are
better
acquainted
he
was
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
dinner
and
the
girls
smiled
on
each
other
they
were
not
the
only
objects
of
mr
collins
s
admiration
the
hall
the
dining
room
and
all
its
furniture
were
examined
and
praised
and
his
commendation
of
everything
would
have
touched
mrs
bennet
s
heart
but
for
the
mortifying
supposition
of
his
viewing
it
all
as
his
own
future
property
the
dinner
too
in
its
turn
was
highly
admired
and
he
begged
to
know
to
which
of
his
fair
cousins
the
excellency
of
its
cooking
was
owing
but
he
was
set
right
there
by
mrs
bennet
who
assured
him
with
some
asperity
that
they
were
very
well
able
to
keep
a
good
cook
and
that
her
daughters
had
nothing
to
do
in
the
kitchen
he
begged
pardon
for
having
displeased
her
in
a
softened
tone
she
declared
herself
not
at
all
offended
but
he
continued
to
apologise
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
chapter
14
during
dinner
mr
bennet
scarcely
spoke
at
all
but
when
the
servants
were
withdrawn
he
thought
it
time
to
have
some
conversation
with
his
guest
and
therefore
started
a
subject
in
which
he
expected
him
to
shine
by
observing
that
he
seemed
very
fortunate
in
his
patroness
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
s
attention
to
his
wishes
and
consideration
for
his
comfort
appeared
very
remarkable
mr
bennet
could
not
have
chosen
better
mr
collins
was
eloquent
in
her
praise
the
subject
elevated
him
to
more
than
usual
solemnity
of
manner
and
with
a
most
important
aspect
he
protested
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
witnessed
such
behaviour
in
a
person
of
rank
such
affability
and
condescension
as
he
had
himself
experienced
from
lady
catherine
she
had
been
graciously
pleased
to
approve
of
both
of
the
discourses
which
he
had
already
had
the
honour
of
preaching
before
her
she
had
also
asked
him
twice
to
dine
at
rosings
and
had
sent
for
him
only
the
saturday
before
to
make
up
her
pool
of
quadrille
in
the
evening
lady
catherine
was
reckoned
proud
by
many
people
he
knew
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
but
affability
in
her
she
had
always
spoken
to
him
as
she
would
to
any
other
gentleman
she
made
not
the
smallest
objection
to
his
joining
in
the
society
of
the
neighbourhood
nor
to
his
leaving
the
parish
occasionally
for
a
week
or
two
to
visit
his
relations
she
had
even
condescended
to
advise
him
to
marry
as
soon
as
he
could
provided
he
chose
with
discretion
and
had
once
paid
him
a
visit
in
his
humble
parsonage
where
she
had
perfectly
approved
all
the
alterations
he
had
been
making
and
had
even
vouchsafed
to
suggest
some
herself
some
shelves
in
the
closet
up
stairs
that
is
all
very
proper
and
civil
i
am
sure
said
mrs
bennet
and
i
dare
say
she
is
a
very
agreeable
woman
it
is
a
pity
that
great
ladies
in
general
are
not
more
like
her
does
she
live
near
you
sir
the
garden
in
which
stands
my
humble
abode
is
separated
only
by
a
lane
from
rosings
park
her
ladyship
s
residence
i
think
you
said
she
was
a
widow
sir
has
she
any
family
she
has
only
one
daughter
the
heiress
of
rosings
and
of
very
extensive
property
ah
said
mrs
bennet
shaking
her
head
then
she
is
better
off
than
many
girls
and
what
sort
of
young
lady
is
she
is
she
handsome
she
is
a
most
charming
young
lady
indeed
lady
catherine
herself
says
that
in
point
of
true
beauty
miss
de
bourgh
is
far
superior
to
the
handsomest
of
her
sex
because
there
is
that
in
her
features
which
marks
the
young
lady
of
distinguished
birth
she
is
unfortunately
of
a
sickly
constitution
which
has
prevented
her
from
making
that
progress
in
many
accomplishments
which
she
could
not
have
otherwise
failed
of
as
i
am
informed
by
the
lady
who
superintended
her
education
and
who
still
resides
with
them
but
she
is
perfectly
amiable
and
often
condescends
to
drive
by
my
humble
abode
in
her
little
phaeton
and
ponies
has
she
been
presented
i
do
not
remember
her
name
among
the
ladies
at
court
her
indifferent
state
of
health
unhappily
prevents
her
being
in
town
and
by
that
means
as
i
told
lady
catherine
one
day
has
deprived
the
british
court
of
its
brightest
ornament
her
ladyship
seemed
pleased
with
the
idea
and
you
may
imagine
that
i
am
happy
on
every
occasion
to
offer
those
little
delicate
compliments
which
are
always
acceptable
to
ladies
i
have
more
than
once
observed
to
lady
catherine
that
her
charming
daughter
seemed
born
to
be
a
duchess
and
that
the
most
elevated
rank
instead
of
giving
her
consequence
would
be
adorned
by
her
these
are
the
kind
of
little
things
which
please
her
ladyship
and
it
is
a
sort
of
attention
which
i
conceive
myself
peculiarly
bound
to
pay
you
judge
very
properly
said
mr
bennet
and
it
is
happy
for
you
that
you
possess
the
talent
of
flattering
with
delicacy
may
i
ask
whether
these
pleasing
attentions
proceed
from
the
impulse
of
the
moment
or
are
the
result
of
previous
study
they
arise
chiefly
from
what
is
passing
at
the
time
and
though
i
sometimes
amuse
myself
with
suggesting
and
arranging
such
little
elegant
compliments
as
may
be
adapted
to
ordinary
occasions
i
always
wish
to
give
them
as
unstudied
an
air
as
possible
mr
bennet
s
expectations
were
fully
answered
his
cousin
was
as
absurd
as
he
had
hoped
and
he
listened
to
him
with
the
keenest
enjoyment
maintaining
at
the
same
time
the
most
resolute
composure
of
countenance
and
except
in
an
occasional
glance
at
elizabeth
requiring
no
partner
in
his
pleasure
by
tea
time
however
the
dose
had
been
enough
and
mr
bennet
was
glad
to
take
his
guest
into
the
drawing
room
again
and
when
tea
was
over
glad
to
invite
him
to
read
aloud
to
the
ladies
mr
collins
readily
assented
and
a
book
was
produced
but
on
beholding
it
for
everything
announced
it
to
be
from
a
circulating
library
he
started
back
and
begging
pardon
protested
that
he
never
read
novels
kitty
stared
at
him
and
lydia
exclaimed
other
books
were
produced
and
after
some
deliberation
he
chose
fordyce
s
sermons
lydia
gaped
as
he
opened
the
volume
and
before
he
had
with
very
monotonous
solemnity
read
three
pages
she
interrupted
him
with
do
you
know
mamma
that
my
uncle
phillips
talks
of
turning
away
richard
and
if
he
does
colonel
forster
will
hire
him
my
aunt
told
me
so
herself
on
saturday
i
shall
walk
to
meryton
to
morrow
to
hear
more
about
it
and
to
ask
when
mr
denny
comes
back
from
town
lydia
was
bid
by
her
two
eldest
sisters
to
hold
her
tongue
but
mr
collins
much
offended
laid
aside
his
book
and
said
i
have
often
observed
how
little
young
ladies
are
interested
by
books
of
a
serious
stamp
though
written
solely
for
their
benefit
it
amazes
me
i
confess
for
certainly
there
can
be
nothing
so
advantageous
to
them
as
instruction
but
i
will
no
longer
importune
my
young
cousin
then
turning
to
mr
bennet
he
offered
himself
as
his
antagonist
at
backgammon
mr
bennet
accepted
the
challenge
observing
that
he
acted
very
wisely
in
leaving
the
girls
to
their
own
trifling
amusements
mrs
bennet
and
her
daughters
apologised
most
civilly
for
lydia
s
interruption
and
promised
that
it
should
not
occur
again
if
he
would
resume
his
book
but
mr
collins
after
assuring
them
that
he
bore
his
young
cousin
no
ill
will
and
should
never
resent
her
behaviour
as
any
affront
seated
himself
at
another
table
with
mr
bennet
and
prepared
for
backgammon
chapter
15
mr
collins
was
not
a
sensible
man
and
the
deficiency
of
nature
had
been
but
little
assisted
by
education
or
society
the
greatest
part
of
his
life
having
been
spent
under
the
guidance
of
an
illiterate
and
miserly
father
and
though
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
universities
he
had
merely
kept
the
necessary
terms
without
forming
at
it
any
useful
acquaintance
the
subjection
in
which
his
father
had
brought
him
up
had
given
him
originally
great
humility
of
manner
but
it
was
now
a
good
deal
counteracted
by
the
self
conceit
of
a
weak
head
living
in
retirement
and
the
consequential
feelings
of
early
and
unexpected
prosperity
a
fortunate
chance
had
recommended
him
to
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
when
the
living
of
hunsford
was
vacant
and
the
respect
which
he
felt
for
her
high
rank
and
his
veneration
for
her
as
his
patroness
mingling
with
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
of
his
authority
as
a
clergyman
and
his
right
as
a
rector
made
him
altogether
a
mixture
of
pride
and
obsequiousness
self
importance
and
humility
having
now
a
good
house
and
a
very
sufficient
income
he
intended
to
marry
and
in
seeking
a
reconciliation
with
the
longbourn
family
he
had
a
wife
in
view
as
he
meant
to
choose
one
of
the
daughters
if
he
found
them
as
handsome
and
amiable
as
they
were
represented
by
common
report
this
was
his
plan
of
amends
of
atonement
for
inheriting
their
father
s
estate
and
he
thought
it
an
excellent
one
full
of
eligibility
and
suitableness
and
excessively
generous
and
disinterested
on
his
own
part
his
plan
did
not
vary
on
seeing
them
miss
bennet
s
lovely
face
confirmed
his
views
and
established
all
his
strictest
notions
of
what
was
due
to
seniority
and
for
the
first
evening
she
was
his
settled
choice
the
next
morning
however
made
an
alteration
for
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
tete
a
tete
with
mrs
bennet
before
breakfast
a
conversation
beginning
with
his
parsonage
house
and
leading
naturally
to
the
avowal
of
his
hopes
that
a
mistress
might
be
found
for
it
at
longbourn
produced
from
her
amid
very
complaisant
smiles
and
general
encouragement
a
caution
against
the
very
jane
he
had
fixed
on
as
to
her
younger
daughters
she
could
not
take
upon
her
to
say
she
could
not
positively
answer
but
she
did
not
know
of
any
prepossession
her
eldest
daughter
she
must
just
mention
she
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
to
hint
was
likely
to
be
very
soon
engaged
mr
collins
had
only
to
change
from
jane
to
elizabeth
and
it
was
soon
done
done
while
mrs
bennet
was
stirring
the
fire
elizabeth
equally
next
to
jane
in
birth
and
beauty
succeeded
her
of
course
mrs
bennet
treasured
up
the
hint
and
trusted
that
she
might
soon
have
two
daughters
married
and
the
man
whom
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
of
the
day
before
was
now
high
in
her
good
graces
lydia
s
intention
of
walking
to
meryton
was
not
forgotten
every
sister
except
mary
agreed
to
go
with
her
and
mr
collins
was
to
attend
them
at
the
request
of
mr
bennet
who
was
most
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
and
have
his
library
to
himself
for
thither
mr
collins
had
followed
him
after
breakfast
and
there
he
would
continue
nominally
engaged
with
one
of
the
largest
folios
in
the
collection
but
really
talking
to
mr
bennet
with
little
cessation
of
his
house
and
garden
at
hunsford
such
doings
discomposed
mr
bennet
exceedingly
in
his
library
he
had
been
always
sure
of
leisure
and
tranquillity
and
though
prepared
as
he
told
elizabeth
to
meet
with
folly
and
conceit
in
every
other
room
of
the
house
he
was
used
to
be
free
from
them
there
his
civility
therefore
was
most
prompt
in
inviting
mr
collins
to
join
his
daughters
in
their
walk
and
mr
collins
being
in
fact
much
better
fitted
for
a
walker
than
a
reader
was
extremely
pleased
to
close
his
large
book
and
go
in
pompous
nothings
on
his
side
and
civil
assents
on
that
of
his
cousins
their
time
passed
till
they
entered
meryton
the
attention
of
the
younger
ones
was
then
no
longer
to
be
gained
by
him
their
eyes
were
immediately
wandering
up
in
the
street
in
quest
of
the
officers
and
nothing
less
than
a
very
smart
bonnet
indeed
or
a
really
new
muslin
in
a
shop
window
could
recall
them
but
the
attention
of
every
lady
was
soon
caught
by
a
young
man
whom
they
had
never
seen
before
of
most
gentlemanlike
appearance
walking
with
another
officer
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
the
officer
was
the
very
mr
denny
concerning
whose
return
from
london
lydia
came
to
inquire
and
he
bowed
as
they
passed
all
were
struck
with
the
stranger
s
air
all
wondered
who
he
could
be
and
kitty
and
lydia
determined
if
possible
to
find
out
led
the
way
across
the
street
under
pretense
of
wanting
something
in
an
opposite
shop
and
fortunately
had
just
gained
the
pavement
when
the
two
gentlemen
turning
back
had
reached
the
same
spot
mr
denny
addressed
them
directly
and
entreated
permission
to
introduce
his
friend
mr
wickham
who
had
returned
with
him
the
day
before
from
town
and
he
was
happy
to
say
had
accepted
a
commission
in
their
corps
this
was
exactly
as
it
should
be
for
the
young
man
wanted
only
regimentals
to
make
him
completely
charming
his
appearance
was
greatly
in
his
favour
he
had
all
the
best
part
of
beauty
a
fine
countenance
a
good
figure
and
very
pleasing
address
the
introduction
was
followed
up
on
his
side
by
a
happy
readiness
of
conversation
a
readiness
at
the
same
time
perfectly
correct
and
unassuming
and
the
whole
party
were
still
standing
and
talking
together
very
agreeably
when
the
sound
of
horses
drew
their
notice
and
darcy
and
bingley
were
seen
riding
down
the
street
on
distinguishing
the
ladies
of
the
group
the
two
gentlemen
came
directly
towards
them
and
began
the
usual
civilities
bingley
was
the
principal
spokesman
and
miss
bennet
the
principal
object
he
was
then
he
said
on
his
way
to
longbourn
on
purpose
to
inquire
after
her
mr
darcy
corroborated
it
with
a
bow
and
was
beginning
to
determine
not
to
fix
his
eyes
on
elizabeth
when
they
were
suddenly
arrested
by
the
sight
of
the
stranger
and
elizabeth
happening
to
see
the
countenance
of
both
as
they
looked
at
each
other
was
all
astonishment
at
the
effect
of
the
meeting
both
changed
colour
one
looked
white
the
other
red
mr
wickham
after
a
few
moments
touched
his
hat
a
salutation
which
mr
darcy
just
deigned
to
return
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
it
was
impossible
not
to
long
to
know
in
another
minute
mr
bingley
but
without
seeming
to
have
noticed
what
passed
took
leave
and
rode
on
with
his
friend
mr
denny
and
mr
wickham
walked
with
the
young
ladies
to
the
door
of
mr
phillip
s
house
and
then
made
their
bows
in
spite
of
miss
lydia
s
pressing
entreaties
that
they
should
come
in
and
even
in
spite
of
mrs
phillips
s
throwing
up
the
parlour
window
and
loudly
seconding
the
invitation
mrs
phillips
was
always
glad
to
see
her
nieces
and
the
two
eldest
from
their
recent
absence
were
particularly
welcome
and
she
was
eagerly
expressing
her
surprise
at
their
sudden
return
home
which
as
their
own
carriage
had
not
fetched
them
she
should
have
known
nothing
about
if
she
had
not
happened
to
see
mr
jones
s
shop
boy
in
the
street
who
had
told
her
that
they
were
not
to
send
any
more
draughts
to
netherfield
because
the
miss
bennets
were
come
away
when
her
civility
was
claimed
towards
mr
collins
by
jane
s
introduction
of
him
she
received
him
with
her
very
best
politeness
which
he
returned
with
as
much
more
apologising
for
his
intrusion
without
any
previous
acquaintance
with
her
which
he
could
not
help
flattering
himself
however
might
be
justified
by
his
relationship
to
the
young
ladies
who
introduced
him
to
her
notice
mrs
phillips
was
quite
awed
by
such
an
excess
of
good
breeding
but
her
contemplation
of
one
stranger
was
soon
put
to
an
end
by
exclamations
and
inquiries
about
the
other
of
whom
however
she
could
only
tell
her
nieces
what
they
already
knew
that
mr
denny
had
brought
him
from
london
and
that
he
was
to
have
a
lieutenant
s
commission
in
the
shire
she
had
been
watching
him
the
last
hour
she
said
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
street
and
had
mr
wickham
appeared
kitty
and
lydia
would
certainly
have
continued
the
occupation
but
unluckily
no
one
passed
windows
now
except
a
few
of
the
officers
who
in
comparison
with
the
stranger
were
become
stupid
disagreeable
fellows
some
of
them
were
to
dine
with
the
phillipses
the
next
day
and
their
aunt
promised
to
make
her
husband
call
on
mr
wickham
and
give
him
an
invitation
also
if
the
family
from
longbourn
would
come
in
the
evening
this
was
agreed
to
and
mrs
phillips
protested
that
they
would
have
a
nice
comfortable
noisy
game
of
lottery
tickets
and
a
little
bit
of
hot
supper
afterwards
the
prospect
of
such
delights
was
very
cheering
and
they
parted
in
mutual
good
spirits
mr
collins
repeated
his
apologies
in
quitting
the
room
and
was
assured
with
unwearying
civility
that
they
were
perfectly
needless
as
they
walked
home
elizabeth
related
to
jane
what
she
had
seen
pass
between
the
two
gentlemen
but
though
jane
would
have
defended
either
or
both
had
they
appeared
to
be
in
the
wrong
she
could
no
more
explain
such
behaviour
than
her
sister
mr
collins
on
his
return
highly
gratified
mrs
bennet
by
admiring
mrs
phillips
s
manners
and
politeness
he
protested
that
except
lady
catherine
and
her
daughter
he
had
never
seen
a
more
elegant
woman
for
she
had
not
only
received
him
with
the
utmost
civility
but
even
pointedly
included
him
in
her
invitation
for
the
next
evening
although
utterly
unknown
to
her
before
something
he
supposed
might
be
attributed
to
his
connection
with
them
but
yet
he
had
never
met
with
so
much
attention
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
chapter
16
as
no
objection
was
made
to
the
young
people
s
engagement
with
their
aunt
and
all
mr
collins
s
scruples
of
leaving
mr
and
mrs
bennet
for
a
single
evening
during
his
visit
were
most
steadily
resisted
the
coach
conveyed
him
and
his
five
cousins
at
a
suitable
hour
to
meryton
and
the
girls
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
as
they
entered
the
drawing
room
that
mr
wickham
had
accepted
their
uncle
s
invitation
and
was
then
in
the
house
when
this
information
was
given
and
they
had
all
taken
their
seats
mr
collins
was
at
leisure
to
look
around
him
and
admire
and
he
was
so
much
struck
with
the
size
and
furniture
of
the
apartment
that
he
declared
he
might
almost
have
supposed
himself
in
the
small
summer
breakfast
parlour
at
rosings
a
comparison
that
did
not
at
first
convey
much
gratification
but
when
mrs
phillips
understood
from
him
what
rosings
was
and
who
was
its
proprietor
when
she
had
listened
to
the
description
of
only
one
of
lady
catherine
s
drawing
rooms
and
found
that
the
chimney
piece
alone
had
cost
eight
hundred
pounds
she
felt
all
the
force
of
the
compliment
and
would
hardly
have
resented
a
comparison
with
the
housekeeper
s
room
in
describing
to
her
all
the
grandeur
of
lady
catherine
and
her
mansion
with
occasional
digressions
in
praise
of
his
own
humble
abode
and
the
improvements
it
was
receiving
he
was
happily
employed
until
the
gentlemen
joined
them
and
he
found
in
mrs
phillips
a
very
attentive
listener
whose
opinion
of
his
consequence
increased
with
what
she
heard
and
who
was
resolving
to
retail
it
all
among
her
neighbours
as
soon
as
she
could
to
the
girls
who
could
not
listen
to
their
cousin
and
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wish
for
an
instrument
and
examine
their
own
indifferent
imitations
of
china
on
the
mantelpiece
the
interval
of
waiting
appeared
very
long
it
was
over
at
last
however
the
gentlemen
did
approach
and
when
mr
wickham
walked
into
the
room
elizabeth
felt
that
she
had
neither
been
seeing
him
before
nor
thinking
of
him
since
with
the
smallest
degree
of
unreasonable
admiration
the
officers
of
the
shire
were
in
general
a
very
creditable
gentlemanlike
set
and
the
best
of
them
were
of
the
present
party
but
mr
wickham
was
as
far
beyond
them
all
in
person
countenance
air
and
walk
as
they
were
superior
to
the
broad
faced
stuffy
uncle
phillips
breathing
port
wine
who
followed
them
into
the
room
mr
wickham
was
the
happy
man
towards
whom
almost
every
female
eye
was
turned
and
elizabeth
was
the
happy
woman
by
whom
he
finally
seated
himself
and
the
agreeable
manner
in
which
he
immediately
fell
into
conversation
though
it
was
only
on
its
being
a
wet
night
made
her
feel
that
the
commonest
dullest
most
threadbare
topic
might
be
rendered
interesting
by
the
skill
of
the
speaker
with
such
rivals
for
the
notice
of
the
fair
as
mr
wickham
and
the
officers
mr
collins
seemed
to
sink
into
insignificance
to
the
young
ladies
he
certainly
was
nothing
but
he
had
still
at
intervals
a
kind
listener
in
mrs
phillips
and
was
by
her
watchfulness
most
abundantly
supplied
with
coffee
and
muffin
when
the
card
tables
were
placed
he
had
the
opportunity
of
obliging
her
in
turn
by
sitting
down
to
whist
i
know
little
of
the
game
at
present
said
he
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
improve
myself
for
in
my
situation
in
life
mrs
phillips
was
very
glad
for
his
compliance
but
could
not
wait
for
his
reason
mr
wickham
did
not
play
at
whist
and
with
ready
delight
was
he
received
at
the
other
table
between
elizabeth
and
lydia
at
first
there
seemed
danger
of
lydia
s
engrossing
him
entirely
for
she
was
a
most
determined
talker
but
being
likewise
extremely
fond
of
lottery
tickets
she
soon
grew
too
much
interested
in
the
game
too
eager
in
making
bets
and
exclaiming
after
prizes
to
have
attention
for
anyone
in
particular
allowing
for
the
common
demands
of
the
game
mr
wickham
was
therefore
at
leisure
to
talk
to
elizabeth
and
she
was
very
willing
to
hear
him
though
what
she
chiefly
wished
to
hear
she
could
not
hope
to
be
told
the
history
of
his
acquaintance
with
mr
darcy
she
dared
not
even
mention
that
gentleman
her
curiosity
however
was
unexpectedly
relieved
mr
wickham
began
the
subject
himself
he
inquired
how
far
netherfield
was
from
meryton
and
after
receiving
her
answer
asked
in
a
hesitating
manner
how
long
mr
darcy
had
been
staying
there
about
a
month
said
elizabeth
and
then
unwilling
to
let
the
subject
drop
added
he
is
a
man
of
very
large
property
in
derbyshire
i
understand
yes
replied
mr
wickham
his
estate
there
is
a
noble
one
a
clear
ten
thousand
per
annum
you
could
not
have
met
with
a
person
more
capable
of
giving
you
certain
information
on
that
head
than
myself
for
i
have
been
connected
with
his
family
in
a
particular
manner
from
my
infancy
elizabeth
could
not
but
look
surprised
you
may
well
be
surprised
miss
bennet
at
such
an
assertion
after
seeing
as
you
probably
might
the
very
cold
manner
of
our
meeting
yesterday
are
you
much
acquainted
with
mr
darcy
as
much
as
i
ever
wish
to
be
cried
elizabeth
very
warmly
i
have
spent
four
days
in
the
same
house
with
him
and
i
think
him
very
disagreeable
i
have
no
right
to
give
my
opinion
said
wickham
as
to
his
being
agreeable
or
otherwise
i
am
not
qualified
to
form
one
i
have
known
him
too
long
and
too
well
to
be
a
fair
judge
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
impartial
but
i
believe
your
opinion
of
him
would
in
general
astonish
and
perhaps
you
would
not
express
it
quite
so
strongly
anywhere
else
here
you
are
in
your
own
family
upon
my
word
i
say
no
more
here
than
i
might
say
in
any
house
in
the
neighbourhood
except
netherfield
he
is
not
at
all
liked
in
hertfordshire
everybody
is
disgusted
with
his
pride
you
will
not
find
him
more
favourably
spoken
of
by
anyone
i
cannot
pretend
to
be
sorry
said
wickham
after
a
short
interruption
that
he
or
that
any
man
should
not
be
estimated
beyond
their
deserts
but
with
him
i
believe
it
does
not
often
happen
the
world
is
blinded
by
his
fortune
and
consequence
or
frightened
by
his
high
and
imposing
manners
and
sees
him
only
as
he
chooses
to
be
seen
i
should
take
him
even
on
my
slight
acquaintance
to
be
an
ill
tempered
man
wickham
only
shook
his
head
i
wonder
said
he
at
the
next
opportunity
of
speaking
whether
he
is
likely
to
be
in
this
country
much
longer
i
do
not
at
all
know
but
i
heard
nothing
of
his
going
away
when
i
was
at
netherfield
i
hope
your
plans
in
favour
of
the
shire
will
not
be
affected
by
his
being
in
the
neighbourhood
oh
no
it
is
not
for
me
to
be
driven
away
by
mr
darcy
if
he
wishes
to
avoid
seeing
me
he
must
go
we
are
not
on
friendly
terms
and
it
always
gives
me
pain
to
meet
him
but
i
have
no
reason
for
avoiding
him
but
what
i
might
proclaim
before
all
the
world
a
sense
of
very
great
ill
usage
and
most
painful
regrets
at
his
being
what
he
is
his
father
miss
bennet
the
late
mr
darcy
was
one
of
the
best
men
that
ever
breathed
and
the
truest
friend
i
ever
had
and
i
can
never
be
in
company
with
this
mr
darcy
without
being
grieved
to
the
soul
by
a
thousand
tender
recollections
his
behaviour
to
myself
has
been
scandalous
but
i
verily
believe
i
could
forgive
him
anything
and
everything
rather
than
his
disappointing
the
hopes
and
disgracing
the
memory
of
his
father
elizabeth
found
the
interest
of
the
subject
increase
and
listened
with
all
her
heart
but
the
delicacy
of
it
prevented
further
inquiry
mr
wickham
began
to
speak
on
more
general
topics
meryton
the
neighbourhood
the
society
appearing
highly
pleased
with
all
that
he
had
yet
seen
and
speaking
of
the
latter
with
gentle
but
very
intelligible
gallantry
it
was
the
prospect
of
constant
society
and
good
society
he
added
which
was
my
chief
inducement
to
enter
the
shire
i
knew
it
to
be
a
most
respectable
agreeable
corps
and
my
friend
denny
tempted
me
further
by
his
account
of
their
present
quarters
and
the
very
great
attentions
and
excellent
acquaintances
meryton
had
procured
them
society
i
own
is
necessary
to
me
i
have
been
a
disappointed
man
and
my
spirits
will
not
bear
solitude
i
must
have
employment
and
society
a
military
life
is
not
what
i
was
intended
for
but
circumstances
have
now
made
it
eligible
the
church
ought
to
have
been
my
profession
i
was
brought
up
for
the
church
and
i
should
at
this
time
have
been
in
possession
of
a
most
valuable
living
had
it
pleased
the
gentleman
we
were
speaking
of
just
now
indeed
yes
the
late
mr
darcy
bequeathed
me
the
next
presentation
of
the
best
living
in
his
gift
he
was
my
godfather
and
excessively
attached
to
me
i
cannot
do
justice
to
his
kindness
he
meant
to
provide
for
me
amply
and
thought
he
had
done
it
but
when
the
living
fell
it
was
given
elsewhere
good
heavens
cried
elizabeth
but
how
could
that
be
how
could
his
will
be
disregarded
why
did
you
not
seek
legal
redress
there
was
just
such
an
informality
in
the
terms
of
the
bequest
as
to
give
me
no
hope
from
law
a
man
of
honour
could
not
have
doubted
the
intention
but
mr
darcy
chose
to
doubt
it
or
to
treat
it
as
a
merely
conditional
recommendation
and
to
assert
that
i
had
forfeited
all
claim
to
it
by
extravagance
imprudence
in
short
anything
or
nothing
certain
it
is
that
the
living
became
vacant
two
years
ago
exactly
as
i
was
of
an
age
to
hold
it
and
that
it
was
given
to
another
man
and
no
less
certain
is
it
that
i
cannot
accuse
myself
of
having
really
done
anything
to
deserve
to
lose
it
i
have
a
warm
unguarded
temper
and
i
may
have
spoken
my
opinion
of
him
and
to
him
too
freely
i
can
recall
nothing
worse
but
the
fact
is
that
we
are
very
different
sort
of
men
and
that
he
hates
me
this
is
quite
shocking
he
deserves
to
be
publicly
disgraced
some
time
or
other
he
will
be
but
it
shall
not
be
by
me
till
i
can
forget
his
father
i
can
never
defy
or
expose
him
elizabeth
honoured
him
for
such
feelings
and
thought
him
handsomer
than
ever
as
he
expressed
them
but
what
said
she
after
a
pause
can
have
been
his
motive
what
can
have
induced
him
to
behave
so
cruelly
a
thorough
determined
dislike
of
me
a
dislike
which
i
cannot
but
attribute
in
some
measure
to
jealousy
had
the
late
mr
darcy
liked
me
less
his
son
might
have
borne
with
me
better
but
his
father
s
uncommon
attachment
to
me
irritated
him
i
believe
very
early
in
life
he
had
not
a
temper
to
bear
the
sort
of
competition
in
which
we
stood
the
sort
of
preference
which
was
often
given
me
i
had
not
thought
mr
darcy
so
bad
as
this
though
i
have
never
liked
him
i
had
not
thought
so
very
ill
of
him
i
had
supposed
him
to
be
despising
his
fellow
creatures
in
general
but
did
not
suspect
him
of
descending
to
such
malicious
revenge
such
injustice
such
inhumanity
as
this
after
a
few
minutes
reflection
however
she
continued
i
do
remember
his
boasting
one
day
at
netherfield
of
the
implacability
of
his
resentments
of
his
having
an
unforgiving
temper
his
disposition
must
be
dreadful
i
will
not
trust
myself
on
the
subject
replied
wickham
i
can
hardly
be
just
to
him
elizabeth
was
again
deep
in
thought
and
after
a
time
exclaimed
to
treat
in
such
a
manner
the
godson
the
friend
the
favourite
of
his
father
she
could
have
added
a
young
man
too
like
you
whose
very
countenance
may
vouch
for
your
being
amiable
but
she
contented
herself
with
and
one
too
who
had
probably
been
his
companion
from
childhood
connected
together
as
i
think
you
said
in
the
closest
manner
we
were
born
in
the
same
parish
within
the
same
park
the
greatest
part
of
our
youth
was
passed
together
inmates
of
the
same
house
sharing
the
same
amusements
objects
of
the
same
parental
care
my
father
began
life
in
the
profession
which
your
uncle
mr
phillips
appears
to
do
so
much
credit
to
but
he
gave
up
everything
to
be
of
use
to
the
late
mr
darcy
and
devoted
all
his
time
to
the
care
of
the
pemberley
property
he
was
most
highly
esteemed
by
mr
darcy
a
most
intimate
confidential
friend
mr
darcy
often
acknowledged
himself
to
be
under
the
greatest
obligations
to
my
father
s
active
superintendence
and
when
immediately
before
my
father
s
death
mr
darcy
gave
him
a
voluntary
promise
of
providing
for
me
i
am
convinced
that
he
felt
it
to
be
as
much
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
him
as
of
his
affection
to
myself
how
strange
cried
elizabeth
how
abominable
i
wonder
that
the
very
pride
of
this
mr
darcy
has
not
made
him
just
to
you
if
from
no
better
motive
that
he
should
not
have
been
too
proud
to
be
dishonest
for
dishonesty
i
must
call
it
it
is
wonderful
replied
wickham
for
almost
all
his
actions
may
be
traced
to
pride
and
pride
had
often
been
his
best
friend
it
has
connected
him
nearer
with
virtue
than
with
any
other
feeling
but
we
are
none
of
us
consistent
and
in
his
behaviour
to
me
there
were
stronger
impulses
even
than
pride
can
such
abominable
pride
as
his
have
ever
done
him
good
yes
it
has
often
led
him
to
be
liberal
and
generous
to
give
his
money
freely
to
display
hospitality
to
assist
his
tenants
and
relieve
the
poor
family
pride
and
filial
pride
for
he
is
very
proud
of
what
his
father
was
have
done
this
not
to
appear
to
disgrace
his
family
to
degenerate
from
the
popular
qualities
or
lose
the
influence
of
the
pemberley
house
is
a
powerful
motive
he
has
also
brotherly
pride
which
with
some
brotherly
affection
makes
him
a
very
kind
and
careful
guardian
of
his
sister
and
you
will
hear
him
generally
cried
up
as
the
most
attentive
and
best
of
brothers
what
sort
of
girl
is
miss
darcy
he
shook
his
head
i
wish
i
could
call
her
amiable
it
gives
me
pain
to
speak
ill
of
a
darcy
but
she
is
too
much
like
her
brother
very
very
proud
as
a
child
she
was
affectionate
and
pleasing
and
extremely
fond
of
me
and
i
have
devoted
hours
and
hours
to
her
amusement
but
she
is
nothing
to
me
now
she
is
a
handsome
girl
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
and
i
understand
highly
accomplished
since
her
father
s
death
her
home
has
been
london
where
a
lady
lives
with
her
and
superintends
her
education
after
many
pauses
and
many
trials
of
other
subjects
elizabeth
could
not
help
reverting
once
more
to
the
first
and
saying
i
am
astonished
at
his
intimacy
with
mr
bingley
how
can
mr
bingley
who
seems
good
humour
itself
and
is
i
really
believe
truly
amiable
be
in
friendship
with
such
a
man
how
can
they
suit
each
other
do
you
know
mr
bingley
not
at
all
he
is
a
sweet
tempered
amiable
charming
man
he
cannot
know
what
mr
darcy
is
probably
not
but
mr
darcy
can
please
where
he
chooses
he
does
not
want
abilities
he
can
be
a
conversible
companion
if
he
thinks
it
worth
his
while
among
those
who
are
at
all
his
equals
in
consequence
he
is
a
very
different
man
from
what
he
is
to
the
less
prosperous
his
pride
never
deserts
him
but
with
the
rich
he
is
liberal
minded
just
sincere
rational
honourable
and
perhaps
agreeable
allowing
something
for
fortune
and
figure
the
whist
party
soon
afterwards
breaking
up
the
players
gathered
round
the
other
table
and
mr
collins
took
his
station
between
his
cousin
elizabeth
and
mrs
phillips
the
usual
inquiries
as
to
his
success
was
made
by
the
latter
it
had
not
been
very
great
he
had
lost
every
point
but
when
mrs
phillips
began
to
express
her
concern
thereupon
he
assured
her
with
much
earnest
gravity
that
it
was
not
of
the
least
importance
that
he
considered
the
money
as
a
mere
trifle
and
begged
that
she
would
not
make
herself
uneasy
i
know
very
well
madam
said
he
that
when
persons
sit
down
to
a
card
table
they
must
take
their
chances
of
these
things
and
happily
i
am
not
in
such
circumstances
as
to
make
five
shillings
any
object
there
are
undoubtedly
many
who
could
not
say
the
same
but
thanks
to
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
i
am
removed
far
beyond
the
necessity
of
regarding
little
matters
mr
wickham
s
attention
was
caught
and
after
observing
mr
collins
for
a
few
moments
he
asked
elizabeth
in
a
low
voice
whether
her
relation
was
very
intimately
acquainted
with
the
family
of
de
bourgh
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
she
replied
has
very
lately
given
him
a
living
i
hardly
know
how
mr
collins
was
first
introduced
to
her
notice
but
he
certainly
has
not
known
her
long
you
know
of
course
that
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
and
lady
anne
darcy
were
sisters
consequently
that
she
is
aunt
to
the
present
mr
darcy
no
indeed
i
did
not
i
knew
nothing
at
all
of
lady
catherine
s
connections
i
never
heard
of
her
existence
till
the
day
before
yesterday
her
daughter
miss
de
bourgh
will
have
a
very
large
fortune
and
it
is
believed
that
she
and
her
cousin
will
unite
the
two
estates
this
information
made
elizabeth
smile
as
she
thought
of
poor
miss
bingley
vain
indeed
must
be
all
her
attentions
vain
and
useless
her
affection
for
his
sister
and
her
praise
of
himself
if
he
were
already
self
destined
for
another
mr
collins
said
she
speaks
highly
both
of
lady
catherine
and
her
daughter
but
from
some
particulars
that
he
has
related
of
her
ladyship
i
suspect
his
gratitude
misleads
him
and
that
in
spite
of
her
being
his
patroness
she
is
an
arrogant
conceited
woman
i
believe
her
to
be
both
in
a
great
degree
replied
wickham
i
have
not
seen
her
for
many
years
but
i
very
well
remember
that
i
never
liked
her
and
that
her
manners
were
dictatorial
and
insolent
she
has
the
reputation
of
being
remarkably
sensible
and
clever
but
i
rather
believe
she
derives
part
of
her
abilities
from
her
rank
and
fortune
part
from
her
authoritative
manner
and
the
rest
from
the
pride
for
her
nephew
who
chooses
that
everyone
connected
with
him
should
have
an
understanding
of
the
first
class
elizabeth
allowed
that
he
had
given
a
very
rational
account
of
it
and
they
continued
talking
together
with
mutual
satisfaction
till
supper
put
an
end
to
cards
and
gave
the
rest
of
the
ladies
their
share
of
mr
wickham
s
attentions
there
could
be
no
conversation
in
the
noise
of
mrs
phillips
s
supper
party
but
his
manners
recommended
him
to
everybody
whatever
he
said
was
said
well
and
whatever
he
did
done
gracefully
elizabeth
went
away
with
her
head
full
of
him
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
of
mr
wickham
and
of
what
he
had
told
her
all
the
way
home
but
there
was
not
time
for
her
even
to
mention
his
name
as
they
went
for
neither
lydia
nor
mr
collins
were
once
silent
lydia
talked
incessantly
of
lottery
tickets
of
the
fish
she
had
lost
and
the
fish
she
had
won
and
mr
collins
in
describing
the
civility
of
mr
and
mrs
phillips
protesting
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
regard
his
losses
at
whist
enumerating
all
the
dishes
at
supper
and
repeatedly
fearing
that
he
crowded
his
cousins
had
more
to
say
than
he
could
well
manage
before
the
carriage
stopped
at
longbourn
house
chapter
17
elizabeth
related
to
jane
the
next
day
what
had
passed
between
mr
wickham
and
herself
jane
listened
with
astonishment
and
concern
she
knew
not
how
to
believe
that
mr
darcy
could
be
so
unworthy
of
mr
bingley
s
regard
and
yet
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
question
the
veracity
of
a
young
man
of
such
amiable
appearance
as
wickham
the
possibility
of
his
having
endured
such
unkindness
was
enough
to
interest
all
her
tender
feelings
and
nothing
remained
therefore
to
be
done
but
to
think
well
of
them
both
to
defend
the
conduct
of
each
and
throw
into
the
account
of
accident
or
mistake
whatever
could
not
be
otherwise
explained
they
have
both
said
she
been
deceived
i
dare
say
in
some
way
or
other
of
which
we
can
form
no
idea
interested
people
have
perhaps
misrepresented
each
to
the
other
it
is
in
short
impossible
for
us
to
conjecture
the
causes
or
circumstances
which
may
have
alienated
them
without
actual
blame
on
either
side
very
true
indeed
and
now
my
dear
jane
what
have
you
got
to
say
on
behalf
of
the
interested
people
who
have
probably
been
concerned
in
the
business
do
clear
them
too
or
we
shall
be
obliged
to
think
ill
of
somebody
laugh
as
much
as
you
choose
but
you
will
not
laugh
me
out
of
my
opinion
my
dearest
lizzy
do
but
consider
in
what
a
disgraceful
light
it
places
mr
darcy
to
be
treating
his
father
s
favourite
in
such
a
manner
one
whom
his
father
had
promised
to
provide
for
it
is
impossible
no
man
of
common
humanity
no
man
who
had
any
value
for
his
character
could
be
capable
of
it
can
his
most
intimate
friends
be
so
excessively
deceived
in
him
oh
no
i
can
much
more
easily
believe
mr
bingley
s
being
imposed
on
than
that
mr
wickham
should
invent
such
a
history
of
himself
as
he
gave
me
last
night
names
facts
everything
mentioned
without
ceremony
if
it
be
not
so
let
mr
darcy
contradict
it
besides
there
was
truth
in
his
looks
it
is
difficult
indeed
it
is
distressing
one
does
not
know
what
to
think
i
beg
your
pardon
one
knows
exactly
what
to
think
but
jane
could
think
with
certainty
on
only
one
point
that
mr
bingley
if
he
had
been
imposed
on
would
have
much
to
suffer
when
the
affair
became
public
the
two
young
ladies
were
summoned
from
the
shrubbery
where
this
conversation
passed
by
the
arrival
of
the
very
persons
of
whom
they
had
been
speaking
mr
bingley
and
his
sisters
came
to
give
their
personal
invitation
for
the
long
expected
ball
at
netherfield
which
was
fixed
for
the
following
tuesday
the
two
ladies
were
delighted
to
see
their
dear
friend
again
called
it
an
age
since
they
had
met
and
repeatedly
asked
what
she
had
been
doing
with
herself
since
their
separation
to
the
rest
of
the
family
they
paid
little
attention
avoiding
mrs
bennet
as
much
as
possible
saying
not
much
to
elizabeth
and
nothing
at
all
to
the
others
they
were
soon
gone
again
rising
from
their
seats
with
an
activity
which
took
their
brother
by
surprise
and
hurrying
off
as
if
eager
to
escape
from
mrs
bennet
s
civilities
the
prospect
of
the
netherfield
ball
was
extremely
agreeable
to
every
female
of
the
family
mrs
bennet
chose
to
consider
it
as
given
in
compliment
to
her
eldest
daughter
and
was
particularly
flattered
by
receiving
the
invitation
from
mr
bingley
himself
instead
of
a
ceremonious
card
jane
pictured
to
herself
a
happy
evening
in
the
society
of
her
two
friends
and
the
attentions
of
her
brother
and
elizabeth
thought
with
pleasure
of
dancing
a
great
deal
with
mr
wickham
and
of
seeing
a
confirmation
of
everything
in
mr
darcy
s
look
and
behaviour
the
happiness
anticipated
by
catherine
and
lydia
depended
less
on
any
single
event
or
any
particular
person
for
though
they
each
like
elizabeth
meant
to
dance
half
the
evening
with
mr
wickham
he
was
by
no
means
the
only
partner
who
could
satisfy
them
and
a
ball
was
at
any
rate
a
ball
and
even
mary
could
assure
her
family
that
she
had
no
disinclination
for
it
while
i
can
have
my
mornings
to
myself
said
she
it
is
enough
i
think
it
is
no
sacrifice
to
join
occasionally
in
evening
engagements
society
has
claims
on
us
all
and
i
profess
myself
one
of
those
who
consider
intervals
of
recreation
and
amusement
as
desirable
for
everybody
elizabeth
s
spirits
were
so
high
on
this
occasion
that
though
she
did
not
often
speak
unnecessarily
to
mr
collins
she
could
not
help
asking
him
whether
he
intended
to
accept
mr
bingley
s
invitation
and
if
he
did
whether
he
would
think
it
proper
to
join
in
the
evening
s
amusement
and
she
was
rather
surprised
to
find
that
he
entertained
no
scruple
whatever
on
that
head
and
was
very
far
from
dreading
a
rebuke
either
from
the
archbishop
or
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
by
venturing
to
dance
i
am
by
no
means
of
the
opinion
i
assure
you
said
he
that
a
ball
of
this
kind
given
by
a
young
man
of
character
to
respectable
people
can
have
any
evil
tendency
and
i
am
so
far
from
objecting
to
dancing
myself
that
i
shall
hope
to
be
honoured
with
the
hands
of
all
my
fair
cousins
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
i
take
this
opportunity
of
soliciting
yours
miss
elizabeth
for
the
two
first
dances
especially
a
preference
which
i
trust
my
cousin
jane
will
attribute
to
the
right
cause
and
not
to
any
disrespect
for
her
elizabeth
felt
herself
completely
taken
in
she
had
fully
proposed
being
engaged
by
mr
wickham
for
those
very
dances
and
to
have
mr
collins
instead
her
liveliness
had
never
been
worse
timed
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
mr
wickham
s
happiness
and
her
own
were
perforce
delayed
a
little
longer
and
mr
collins
s
proposal
accepted
with
as
good
a
grace
as
she
could
she
was
not
the
better
pleased
with
his
gallantry
from
the
idea
it
suggested
of
something
more
it
now
first
struck
her
that
she
was
selected
from
among
her
sisters
as
worthy
of
being
mistress
of
hunsford
parsonage
and
of
assisting
to
form
a
quadrille
table
at
rosings
in
the
absence
of
more
eligible
visitors
the
idea
soon
reached
to
conviction
as
she
observed
his
increasing
civilities
toward
herself
and
heard
his
frequent
attempt
at
a
compliment
on
her
wit
and
vivacity
and
though
more
astonished
than
gratified
herself
by
this
effect
of
her
charms
it
was
not
long
before
her
mother
gave
her
to
understand
that
the
probability
of
their
marriage
was
extremely
agreeable
to
her
elizabeth
however
did
not
choose
to
take
the
hint
being
well
aware
that
a
serious
dispute
must
be
the
consequence
of
any
reply
mr
collins
might
never
make
the
offer
and
till
he
did
it
was
useless
to
quarrel
about
him
if
there
had
not
been
a
netherfield
ball
to
prepare
for
and
talk
of
the
younger
miss
bennets
would
have
been
in
a
very
pitiable
state
at
this
time
for
from
the
day
of
the
invitation
to
the
day
of
the
ball
there
was
such
a
succession
of
rain
as
prevented
their
walking
to
meryton
once
no
aunt
no
officers
no
news
could
be
sought
after
the
very
shoe
roses
for
netherfield
were
got
by
proxy
even
elizabeth
might
have
found
some
trial
of
her
patience
in
weather
which
totally
suspended
the
improvement
of
her
acquaintance
with
mr
wickham
and
nothing
less
than
a
dance
on
tuesday
could
have
made
such
a
friday
saturday
sunday
and
monday
endurable
to
kitty
and
lydia
chapter
18
till
elizabeth
entered
the
drawing
room
at
netherfield
and
looked
in
vain
for
mr
wickham
among
the
cluster
of
red
coats
there
assembled
a
doubt
of
his
being
present
had
never
occurred
to
her
the
certainty
of
meeting
him
had
not
been
checked
by
any
of
those
recollections
that
might
not
unreasonably
have
alarmed
her
she
had
dressed
with
more
than
usual
care
and
prepared
in
the
highest
spirits
for
the
conquest
of
all
that
remained
unsubdued
of
his
heart
trusting
that
it
was
not
more
than
might
be
won
in
the
course
of
the
evening
but
in
an
instant
arose
the
dreadful
suspicion
of
his
being
purposely
omitted
for
mr
darcy
s
pleasure
in
the
bingleys
invitation
to
the
officers
and
though
this
was
not
exactly
the
case
the
absolute
fact
of
his
absence
was
pronounced
by
his
friend
denny
to
whom
lydia
eagerly
applied
and
who
told
them
that
wickham
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
town
on
business
the
day
before
and
was
not
yet
returned
adding
with
a
significant
smile
i
do
not
imagine
his
business
would
have
called
him
away
just
now
if
he
had
not
wanted
to
avoid
a
certain
gentleman
here
this
part
of
his
intelligence
though
unheard
by
lydia
was
caught
by
elizabeth
and
as
it
assured
her
that
darcy
was
not
less
answerable
for
wickham
s
absence
than
if
her
first
surmise
had
been
just
every
feeling
of
displeasure
against
the
former
was
so
sharpened
by
immediate
disappointment
that
she
could
hardly
reply
with
tolerable
civility
to
the
polite
inquiries
which
he
directly
afterwards
approached
to
make
attendance
forbearance
patience
with
darcy
was
injury
to
wickham
she
was
resolved
against
any
sort
of
conversation
with
him
and
turned
away
with
a
degree
of
ill
humour
which
she
could
not
wholly
surmount
even
in
speaking
to
mr
bingley
whose
blind
partiality
provoked
her
but
elizabeth
was
not
formed
for
ill
humour
and
though
every
prospect
of
her
own
was
destroyed
for
the
evening
it
could
not
dwell
long
on
her
spirits
and
having
told
all
her
griefs
to
charlotte
lucas
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
a
week
she
was
soon
able
to
make
a
voluntary
transition
to
the
oddities
of
her
cousin
and
to
point
him
out
to
her
particular
notice
the
first
two
dances
however
brought
a
return
of
distress
they
were
dances
of
mortification
mr
collins
awkward
and
solemn
apologising
instead
of
attending
and
often
moving
wrong
without
being
aware
of
it
gave
her
all
the
shame
and
misery
which
a
disagreeable
partner
for
a
couple
of
dances
can
give
the
moment
of
her
release
from
him
was
ecstasy
she
danced
next
with
an
officer
and
had
the
refreshment
of
talking
of
wickham
and
of
hearing
that
he
was
universally
liked
when
those
dances
were
over
she
returned
to
charlotte
lucas
and
was
in
conversation
with
her
when
she
found
herself
suddenly
addressed
by
mr
darcy
who
took
her
so
much
by
surprise
in
his
application
for
her
hand
that
without
knowing
what
she
did
she
accepted
him
he
walked
away
again
immediately
and
she
was
left
to
fret
over
her
own
want
of
presence
of
mind
charlotte
tried
to
console
her
i
dare
say
you
will
find
him
very
agreeable
heaven
forbid
that
would
be
the
greatest
misfortune
of
all
to
find
a
man
agreeable
whom
one
is
determined
to
hate
do
not
wish
me
such
an
evil
when
the
dancing
recommenced
however
and
darcy
approached
to
claim
her
hand
charlotte
could
not
help
cautioning
her
in
a
whisper
not
to
be
a
simpleton
and
allow
her
fancy
for
wickham
to
make
her
appear
unpleasant
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
ten
times
his
consequence
elizabeth
made
no
answer
and
took
her
place
in
the
set
amazed
at
the
dignity
to
which
she
was
arrived
in
being
allowed
to
stand
opposite
to
mr
darcy
and
reading
in
her
neighbours
looks
their
equal
amazement
in
beholding
it
they
stood
for
some
time
without
speaking
a
word
and
she
began
to
imagine
that
their
silence
was
to
last
through
the
two
dances
and
at
first
was
resolved
not
to
break
it
till
suddenly
fancying
that
it
would
be
the
greater
punishment
to
her
partner
to
oblige
him
to
talk
she
made
some
slight
observation
on
the
dance
he
replied
and
was
again
silent
after
a
pause
of
some
minutes
she
addressed
him
a
second
time
with
it
is
your
turn
to
say
something
now
mr
darcy
i
talked
about
the
dance
and
you
ought
to
make
some
sort
of
remark
on
the
size
of
the
room
or
the
number
of
couples
he
smiled
and
assured
her
that
whatever
she
wished
him
to
say
should
be
said
very
well
that
reply
will
do
for
the
present
perhaps
by
and
by
i
may
observe
that
private
balls
are
much
pleasanter
than
public
ones
but
now
we
may
be
silent
do
you
talk
by
rule
then
while
you
are
dancing
sometimes
one
must
speak
a
little
you
know
it
would
look
odd
to
be
entirely
silent
for
half
an
hour
together
and
yet
for
the
advantage
of
some
conversation
ought
to
be
so
arranged
as
that
they
may
have
the
trouble
of
saying
as
little
as
possible
are
you
consulting
your
own
feelings
in
the
present
case
or
do
you
imagine
that
you
are
gratifying
mine
both
replied
elizabeth
archly
for
i
have
always
seen
a
great
similarity
in
the
turn
of
our
minds
we
are
each
of
an
unsocial
taciturn
disposition
unwilling
to
speak
unless
we
expect
to
say
something
that
will
amaze
the
whole
room
and
be
handed
down
to
posterity
with
all
the
eclat
of
a
proverb
this
is
no
very
striking
resemblance
of
your
own
character
i
am
sure
said
he
how
near
it
may
be
to
mine
i
cannot
pretend
to
say
you
think
it
a
faithful
portrait
undoubtedly
i
must
not
decide
on
my
own
performance
he
made
no
answer
and
they
were
again
silent
till
they
had
gone
down
the
dance
when
he
asked
her
if
she
and
her
sisters
did
not
very
often
walk
to
meryton
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
added
when
you
met
us
there
the
other
day
we
had
just
been
forming
a
new
acquaintance
the
effect
was
immediate
a
deeper
shade
of
hauteur
overspread
his
features
but
he
said
not
a
word
and
elizabeth
though
blaming
herself
for
her
own
weakness
could
not
go
on
at
length
darcy
spoke
and
in
a
constrained
manner
said
mr
wickham
is
blessed
with
such
happy
manners
as
may
ensure
his
making
friends
whether
he
may
be
equally
capable
of
retaining
them
is
less
certain
he
has
been
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
your
friendship
replied
elizabeth
with
emphasis
and
in
a
manner
which
he
is
likely
to
suffer
from
all
his
life
darcy
made
no
answer
and
seemed
desirous
of
changing
the
subject
at
that
moment
sir
william
lucas
appeared
close
to
them
meaning
to
pass
through
the
set
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
but
on
perceiving
mr
darcy
he
stopped
with
a
bow
of
superior
courtesy
to
compliment
him
on
his
dancing
and
his
partner
i
have
been
most
highly
gratified
indeed
my
dear
sir
such
very
superior
dancing
is
not
often
seen
it
is
evident
that
you
belong
to
the
first
circles
allow
me
to
say
however
that
your
fair
partner
does
not
disgrace
you
and
that
i
must
hope
to
have
this
pleasure
often
repeated
especially
when
a
certain
desirable
event
my
dear
eliza
glancing
at
her
sister
and
bingley
shall
take
place
what
congratulations
will
then
flow
in
i
appeal
to
mr
darcy
but
let
me
not
interrupt
you
sir
you
will
not
thank
me
for
detaining
you
from
the
bewitching
converse
of
that
young
lady
whose
bright
eyes
are
also
upbraiding
me
the
latter
part
of
this
address
was
scarcely
heard
by
darcy
but
sir
william
s
allusion
to
his
friend
seemed
to
strike
him
forcibly
and
his
eyes
were
directed
with
a
very
serious
expression
towards
bingley
and
jane
who
were
dancing
together
recovering
himself
however
shortly
he
turned
to
his
partner
and
said
sir
william
s
interruption
has
made
me
forget
what
we
were
talking
of
i
do
not
think
we
were
speaking
at
all
sir
william
could
not
have
interrupted
two
people
in
the
room
who
had
less
to
say
for
themselves
we
have
tried
two
or
three
subjects
already
without
success
and
what
we
are
to
talk
of
next
i
cannot
imagine
what
think
you
of
books
said
he
smiling
books
oh
no
i
am
sure
we
never
read
the
same
or
not
with
the
same
feelings
i
am
sorry
you
think
so
but
if
that
be
the
case
there
can
at
least
be
no
want
of
subject
we
may
compare
our
different
opinions
no
i
cannot
talk
of
books
in
a
ball
room
my
head
is
always
full
of
something
else
the
present
always
occupies
you
in
such
scenes
does
it
said
he
with
a
look
of
doubt
yes
always
she
replied
without
knowing
what
she
said
for
her
thoughts
had
wandered
far
from
the
subject
as
soon
afterwards
appeared
by
her
suddenly
exclaiming
i
remember
hearing
you
once
say
mr
darcy
that
you
hardly
ever
forgave
that
your
resentment
once
created
was
unappeasable
you
are
very
cautious
i
suppose
as
to
its
being
created
i
am
said
he
with
a
firm
voice
and
never
allow
yourself
to
be
blinded
by
prejudice
i
hope
not
it
is
particularly
incumbent
on
those
who
never
change
their
opinion
to
be
secure
of
judging
properly
at
first
may
i
ask
to
what
these
questions
tend
merely
to
the
illustration
of
your
character
said
she
endeavouring
to
shake
off
her
gravity
i
am
trying
to
make
it
out
and
what
is
your
success
she
shook
her
head
i
do
not
get
on
at
all
i
hear
such
different
accounts
of
you
as
puzzle
me
exceedingly
i
can
readily
believe
answered
he
gravely
that
reports
may
vary
greatly
with
respect
to
me
and
i
could
wish
miss
bennet
that
you
were
not
to
sketch
my
character
at
the
present
moment
as
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
the
performance
would
reflect
no
credit
on
either
but
if
i
do
not
take
your
likeness
now
i
may
never
have
another
opportunity
i
would
by
no
means
suspend
any
pleasure
of
yours
he
coldly
replied
she
said
no
more
and
they
went
down
the
other
dance
and
parted
in
silence
and
on
each
side
dissatisfied
though
not
to
an
equal
degree
for
in
darcy
s
breast
there
was
a
tolerable
powerful
feeling
towards
her
which
soon
procured
her
pardon
and
directed
all
his
anger
against
another
they
had
not
long
separated
when
miss
bingley
came
towards
her
and
with
an
expression
of
civil
disdain
accosted
her
so
miss
eliza
i
hear
you
are
quite
delighted
with
george
wickham
your
sister
has
been
talking
to
me
about
him
and
asking
me
a
thousand
questions
and
i
find
that
the
young
man
quite
forgot
to
tell
you
among
his
other
communication
that
he
was
the
son
of
old
wickham
the
late
mr
darcy
s
steward
let
me
recommend
you
however
as
a
friend
not
to
give
implicit
confidence
to
all
his
assertions
for
as
to
mr
darcy
s
using
him
ill
it
is
perfectly
false
for
on
the
contrary
he
has
always
been
remarkably
kind
to
him
though
george
wickham
has
treated
mr
darcy
in
a
most
infamous
manner
i
do
not
know
the
particulars
but
i
know
very
well
that
mr
darcy
is
not
in
the
least
to
blame
that
he
cannot
bear
to
hear
george
wickham
mentioned
and
that
though
my
brother
thought
that
he
could
not
well
avoid
including
him
in
his
invitation
to
the
officers
he
was
excessively
glad
to
find
that
he
had
taken
himself
out
of
the
way
his
coming
into
the
country
at
all
is
a
most
insolent
thing
indeed
and
i
wonder
how
he
could
presume
to
do
it
i
pity
you
miss
eliza
for
this
discovery
of
your
favourite
s
guilt
but
really
considering
his
descent
one
could
not
expect
much
better
his
guilt
and
his
descent
appear
by
your
account
to
be
the
same
said
elizabeth
angrily
for
i
have
heard
you
accuse
him
of
nothing
worse
than
of
being
the
son
of
mr
darcy
s
steward
and
of
that
i
can
assure
you
he
informed
me
himself
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
miss
bingley
turning
away
with
a
sneer
excuse
my
interference
it
was
kindly
meant
insolent
girl
said
elizabeth
to
herself
you
are
much
mistaken
if
you
expect
to
influence
me
by
such
a
paltry
attack
as
this
i
see
nothing
in
it
but
your
own
wilful
ignorance
and
the
malice
of
mr
darcy
she
then
sought
her
eldest
sister
who
has
undertaken
to
make
inquiries
on
the
same
subject
of
bingley
jane
met
her
with
a
smile
of
such
sweet
complacency
a
glow
of
such
happy
expression
as
sufficiently
marked
how
well
she
was
satisfied
with
the
occurrences
of
the
evening
elizabeth
instantly
read
her
feelings
and
at
that
moment
solicitude
for
wickham
resentment
against
his
enemies
and
everything
else
gave
way
before
the
hope
of
jane
s
being
in
the
fairest
way
for
happiness
i
want
to
know
said
she
with
a
countenance
no
less
smiling
than
her
sister
s
what
you
have
learnt
about
mr
wickham
but
perhaps
you
have
been
too
pleasantly
engaged
to
think
of
any
third
person
in
which
case
you
may
be
sure
of
my
pardon
no
replied
jane
i
have
not
forgotten
him
but
i
have
nothing
satisfactory
to
tell
you
mr
bingley
does
not
know
the
whole
of
his
history
and
is
quite
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
which
have
principally
offended
mr
darcy
but
he
will
vouch
for
the
good
conduct
the
probity
and
honour
of
his
friend
and
is
perfectly
convinced
that
mr
wickham
has
deserved
much
less
attention
from
mr
darcy
than
he
has
received
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
by
his
account
as
well
as
his
sister
s
mr
wickham
is
by
no
means
a
respectable
young
man
i
am
afraid
he
has
been
very
imprudent
and
has
deserved
to
lose
mr
darcy
s
regard
mr
bingley
does
not
know
mr
wickham
himself
no
he
never
saw
him
till
the
other
morning
at
meryton
this
account
then
is
what
he
has
received
from
mr
darcy
i
am
satisfied
but
what
does
he
say
of
the
living
he
does
not
exactly
recollect
the
circumstances
though
he
has
heard
them
from
mr
darcy
more
than
once
but
he
believes
that
it
was
left
to
him
conditionally
only
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
mr
bingley
s
sincerity
said
elizabeth
warmly
but
you
must
excuse
my
not
being
convinced
by
assurances
only
mr
bingley
s
defense
of
his
friend
was
a
very
able
one
i
dare
say
but
since
he
is
unacquainted
with
several
parts
of
the
story
and
has
learnt
the
rest
from
that
friend
himself
i
shall
venture
to
still
think
of
both
gentlemen
as
i
did
before
she
then
changed
the
discourse
to
one
more
gratifying
to
each
and
on
which
there
could
be
no
difference
of
sentiment
elizabeth
listened
with
delight
to
the
happy
though
modest
hopes
which
jane
entertained
of
mr
bingley
s
regard
and
said
all
in
her
power
to
heighten
her
confidence
in
it
on
their
being
joined
by
mr
bingley
himself
elizabeth
withdrew
to
miss
lucas
to
whose
inquiry
after
the
pleasantness
of
her
last
partner
she
had
scarcely
replied
before
mr
collins
came
up
to
them
and
told
her
with
great
exultation
that
he
had
just
been
so
fortunate
as
to
make
a
most
important
discovery
i
have
found
out
said
he
by
a
singular
accident
that
there
is
now
in
the
room
a
near
relation
of
my
patroness
i
happened
to
overhear
the
gentleman
himself
mentioning
to
the
young
lady
who
does
the
honours
of
the
house
the
names
of
his
cousin
miss
de
bourgh
and
of
her
mother
lady
catherine
how
wonderfully
these
sort
of
things
occur
who
would
have
thought
of
my
meeting
with
perhaps
a
nephew
of
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
in
this
assembly
i
am
most
thankful
that
the
discovery
is
made
in
time
for
me
to
pay
my
respects
to
him
which
i
am
now
going
to
do
and
trust
he
will
excuse
my
not
having
done
it
before
my
total
ignorance
of
the
connection
must
plead
my
apology
you
are
not
going
to
introduce
yourself
to
mr
darcy
indeed
i
am
i
shall
entreat
his
pardon
for
not
having
done
it
earlier
i
believe
him
to
be
lady
catherine
s
nephew
it
will
be
in
my
power
to
assure
him
that
her
ladyship
was
quite
well
yesterday
se
nnight
elizabeth
tried
hard
to
dissuade
him
from
such
a
scheme
assuring
him
that
mr
darcy
would
consider
his
addressing
him
without
introduction
as
an
impertinent
freedom
rather
than
a
compliment
to
his
aunt
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
necessary
there
should
be
any
notice
on
either
side
and
that
if
it
were
it
must
belong
to
mr
darcy
the
superior
in
consequence
to
begin
the
acquaintance
mr
collins
listened
to
her
with
the
determined
air
of
following
his
own
inclination
and
when
she
ceased
speaking
replied
thus
my
dear
miss
elizabeth
i
have
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
in
your
excellent
judgement
in
all
matters
within
the
scope
of
your
understanding
but
permit
me
to
say
that
there
must
be
a
wide
difference
between
the
established
forms
of
ceremony
amongst
the
laity
and
those
which
regulate
the
clergy
for
give
me
leave
to
observe
that
i
consider
the
clerical
office
as
equal
in
point
of
dignity
with
the
highest
rank
in
the
kingdom
provided
that
a
proper
humility
of
behaviour
is
at
the
same
time
maintained
you
must
therefore
allow
me
to
follow
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
on
this
occasion
which
leads
me
to
perform
what
i
look
on
as
a
point
of
duty
pardon
me
for
neglecting
to
profit
by
your
advice
which
on
every
other
subject
shall
be
my
constant
guide
though
in
the
case
before
us
i
consider
myself
more
fitted
by
education
and
habitual
study
to
decide
on
what
is
right
than
a
young
lady
like
yourself
and
with
a
low
bow
he
left
her
to
attack
mr
darcy
whose
reception
of
his
advances
she
eagerly
watched
and
whose
astonishment
at
being
so
addressed
was
very
evident
her
cousin
prefaced
his
speech
with
a
solemn
bow
and
though
she
could
not
hear
a
word
of
it
she
felt
as
if
hearing
it
all
and
saw
in
the
motion
of
his
lips
the
words
apology
hunsford
and
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
it
vexed
her
to
see
him
expose
himself
to
such
a
man
mr
darcy
was
eyeing
him
with
unrestrained
wonder
and
when
at
last
mr
collins
allowed
him
time
to
speak
replied
with
an
air
of
distant
civility
mr
collins
however
was
not
discouraged
from
speaking
again
and
mr
darcy
s
contempt
seemed
abundantly
increasing
with
the
length
of
his
second
speech
and
at
the
end
of
it
he
only
made
him
a
slight
bow
and
moved
another
way
mr
collins
then
returned
to
elizabeth
i
have
no
reason
i
assure
you
said
he
to
be
dissatisfied
with
my
reception
mr
darcy
seemed
much
pleased
with
the
attention
he
answered
me
with
the
utmost
civility
and
even
paid
me
the
compliment
of
saying
that
he
was
so
well
convinced
of
lady
catherine
s
discernment
as
to
be
certain
she
could
never
bestow
a
favour
unworthily
it
was
really
a
very
handsome
thought
upon
the
whole
i
am
much
pleased
with
him
as
elizabeth
had
no
longer
any
interest
of
her
own
to
pursue
she
turned
her
attention
almost
entirely
on
her
sister
and
mr
bingley
and
the
train
of
agreeable
reflections
which
her
observations
gave
birth
to
made
her
perhaps
almost
as
happy
as
jane
she
saw
her
in
idea
settled
in
that
very
house
in
all
the
felicity
which
a
marriage
of
true
affection
could
bestow
and
she
felt
capable
under
such
circumstances
of
endeavouring
even
to
like
bingley
s
two
sisters
her
mother
s
thoughts
she
plainly
saw
were
bent
the
same
way
and
she
determined
not
to
venture
near
her
lest
she
might
hear
too
much
when
they
sat
down
to
supper
therefore
she
considered
it
a
most
unlucky
perverseness
which
placed
them
within
one
of
each
other
and
deeply
was
she
vexed
to
find
that
her
mother
was
talking
to
that
one
person
lady
lucas
freely
openly
and
of
nothing
else
but
her
expectation
that
jane
would
soon
be
married
to
mr
bingley
it
was
an
animating
subject
and
mrs
bennet
seemed
incapable
of
fatigue
while
enumerating
the
advantages
of
the
match
his
being
such
a
charming
young
man
and
so
rich
and
living
but
three
miles
from
them
were
the
first
points
of
self
gratulation
and
then
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
think
how
fond
the
two
sisters
were
of
jane
and
to
be
certain
that
they
must
desire
the
connection
as
much
as
she
could
do
it
was
moreover
such
a
promising
thing
for
her
younger
daughters
as
jane
s
marrying
so
greatly
must
throw
them
in
the
way
of
other
rich
men
and
lastly
it
was
so
pleasant
at
her
time
of
life
to
be
able
to
consign
her
single
daughters
to
the
care
of
their
sister
that
she
might
not
be
obliged
to
go
into
company
more
than
she
liked
it
was
necessary
to
make
this
circumstance
a
matter
of
pleasure
because
on
such
occasions
it
is
the
etiquette
but
no
one
was
less
likely
than
mrs
bennet
to
find
comfort
in
staying
home
at
any
period
of
her
life
she
concluded
with
many
good
wishes
that
lady
lucas
might
soon
be
equally
fortunate
though
evidently
and
triumphantly
believing
there
was
no
chance
of
it
in
vain
did
elizabeth
endeavour
to
check
the
rapidity
of
her
mother
s
words
or
persuade
her
to
describe
her
felicity
in
a
less
audible
whisper
for
to
her
inexpressible
vexation
she
could
perceive
that
the
chief
of
it
was
overheard
by
mr
darcy
who
sat
opposite
to
them
her
mother
only
scolded
her
for
being
nonsensical
what
is
mr
darcy
to
me
pray
that
i
should
be
afraid
of
him
i
am
sure
we
owe
him
no
such
particular
civility
as
to
be
obliged
to
say
nothing
he
may
not
like
to
hear
for
heaven
s
sake
madam
speak
lower
what
advantage
can
it
be
for
you
to
offend
mr
darcy
you
will
never
recommend
yourself
to
his
friend
by
so
doing
nothing
that
she
could
say
however
had
any
influence
her
mother
would
talk
of
her
views
in
the
same
intelligible
tone
elizabeth
blushed
and
blushed
again
with
shame
and
vexation
she
could
not
help
frequently
glancing
her
eye
at
mr
darcy
though
every
glance
convinced
her
of
what
she
dreaded
for
though
he
was
not
always
looking
at
her
mother
she
was
convinced
that
his
attention
was
invariably
fixed
by
her
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
gradually
from
indignant
contempt
to
a
composed
and
steady
gravity
at
length
however
mrs
bennet
had
no
more
to
say
and
lady
lucas
who
had
been
long
yawning
at
the
repetition
of
delights
which
she
saw
no
likelihood
of
sharing
was
left
to
the
comforts
of
cold
ham
and
chicken
elizabeth
now
began
to
revive
but
not
long
was
the
interval
of
tranquillity
for
when
supper
was
over
singing
was
talked
of
and
she
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
mary
after
very
little
entreaty
preparing
to
oblige
the
company
by
many
significant
looks
and
silent
entreaties
did
she
endeavour
to
prevent
such
a
proof
of
complaisance
but
in
vain
mary
would
not
understand
them
such
an
opportunity
of
exhibiting
was
delightful
to
her
and
she
began
her
song
elizabeth
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
with
most
painful
sensations
and
she
watched
her
progress
through
the
several
stanzas
with
an
impatience
which
was
very
ill
rewarded
at
their
close
for
mary
on
receiving
amongst
the
thanks
of
the
table
the
hint
of
a
hope
that
she
might
be
prevailed
on
to
favour
them
again
after
the
pause
of
half
a
minute
began
another
mary
s
powers
were
by
no
means
fitted
for
such
a
display
her
voice
was
weak
and
her
manner
affected
elizabeth
was
in
agonies
she
looked
at
jane
to
see
how
she
bore
it
but
jane
was
very
composedly
talking
to
bingley
she
looked
at
his
two
sisters
and
saw
them
making
signs
of
derision
at
each
other
and
at
darcy
who
continued
however
imperturbably
grave
she
looked
at
her
father
to
entreat
his
interference
lest
mary
should
be
singing
all
night
he
took
the
hint
and
when
mary
had
finished
her
second
song
said
aloud
that
will
do
extremely
well
child
you
have
delighted
us
long
enough
let
the
other
young
ladies
have
time
to
exhibit
mary
though
pretending
not
to
hear
was
somewhat
disconcerted
and
elizabeth
sorry
for
her
and
sorry
for
her
father
s
speech
was
afraid
her
anxiety
had
done
no
good
others
of
the
party
were
now
applied
to
if
i
said
mr
collins
were
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
sing
i
should
have
great
pleasure
i
am
sure
in
obliging
the
company
with
an
air
for
i
consider
music
as
a
very
innocent
diversion
and
perfectly
compatible
with
the
profession
of
a
clergyman
i
do
not
mean
however
to
assert
that
we
can
be
justified
in
devoting
too
much
of
our
time
to
music
for
there
are
certainly
other
things
to
be
attended
to
the
rector
of
a
parish
has
much
to
do
in
the
first
place
he
must
make
such
an
agreement
for
tithes
as
may
be
beneficial
to
himself
and
not
offensive
to
his
patron
he
must
write
his
own
sermons
and
the
time
that
remains
will
not
be
too
much
for
his
parish
duties
and
the
care
and
improvement
of
his
dwelling
which
he
cannot
be
excused
from
making
as
comfortable
as
possible
and
i
do
not
think
it
of
light
importance
that
he
should
have
attentive
and
conciliatory
manners
towards
everybody
especially
towards
those
to
whom
he
owes
his
preferment
i
cannot
acquit
him
of
that
duty
nor
could
i
think
well
of
the
man
who
should
omit
an
occasion
of
testifying
his
respect
towards
anybody
connected
with
the
family
and
with
a
bow
to
mr
darcy
he
concluded
his
speech
which
had
been
spoken
so
loud
as
to
be
heard
by
half
the
room
many
stared
many
smiled
but
no
one
looked
more
amused
than
mr
bennet
himself
while
his
wife
seriously
commended
mr
collins
for
having
spoken
so
sensibly
and
observed
in
a
half
whisper
to
lady
lucas
that
he
was
a
remarkably
clever
good
kind
of
young
man
to
elizabeth
it
appeared
that
had
her
family
made
an
agreement
to
expose
themselves
as
much
as
they
could
during
the
evening
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
play
their
parts
with
more
spirit
or
finer
success
and
happy
did
she
think
it
for
bingley
and
her
sister
that
some
of
the
exhibition
had
escaped
his
notice
and
that
his
feelings
were
not
of
a
sort
to
be
much
distressed
by
the
folly
which
he
must
have
witnessed
that
his
two
sisters
and
mr
darcy
however
should
have
such
an
opportunity
of
ridiculing
her
relations
was
bad
enough
and
she
could
not
determine
whether
the
silent
contempt
of
the
gentleman
or
the
insolent
smiles
of
the
ladies
were
more
intolerable
the
rest
of
the
evening
brought
her
little
amusement
she
was
teased
by
mr
collins
who
continued
most
perseveringly
by
her
side
and
though
he
could
not
prevail
on
her
to
dance
with
him
again
put
it
out
of
her
power
to
dance
with
others
in
vain
did
she
entreat
him
to
stand
up
with
somebody
else
and
offer
to
introduce
him
to
any
young
lady
in
the
room
he
assured
her
that
as
to
dancing
he
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
it
that
his
chief
object
was
by
delicate
attentions
to
recommend
himself
to
her
and
that
he
should
therefore
make
a
point
of
remaining
close
to
her
the
whole
evening
there
was
no
arguing
upon
such
a
project
she
owed
her
greatest
relief
to
her
friend
miss
lucas
who
often
joined
them
and
good
naturedly
engaged
mr
collins
s
conversation
to
herself
she
was
at
least
free
from
the
offense
of
mr
darcy
s
further
notice
though
often
standing
within
a
very
short
distance
of
her
quite
disengaged
he
never
came
near
enough
to
speak
she
felt
it
to
be
the
probable
consequence
of
her
allusions
to
mr
wickham
and
rejoiced
in
it
the
longbourn
party
were
the
last
of
all
the
company
to
depart
and
by
a
manoeuvre
of
mrs
bennet
had
to
wait
for
their
carriage
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
everybody
else
was
gone
which
gave
them
time
to
see
how
heartily
they
were
wished
away
by
some
of
the
family
mrs
hurst
and
her
sister
scarcely
opened
their
mouths
except
to
complain
of
fatigue
and
were
evidently
impatient
to
have
the
house
to
themselves
they
repulsed
every
attempt
of
mrs
bennet
at
conversation
and
by
so
doing
threw
a
languor
over
the
whole
party
which
was
very
little
relieved
by
the
long
speeches
of
mr
collins
who
was
complimenting
mr
bingley
and
his
sisters
on
the
elegance
of
their
entertainment
and
the
hospitality
and
politeness
which
had
marked
their
behaviour
to
their
guests
darcy
said
nothing
at
all
mr
bennet
in
equal
silence
was
enjoying
the
scene
mr
bingley
and
jane
were
standing
together
a
little
detached
from
the
rest
and
talked
only
to
each
other
elizabeth
preserved
as
steady
a
silence
as
either
mrs
hurst
or
miss
bingley
and
even
lydia
was
too
much
fatigued
to
utter
more
than
the
occasional
exclamation
of
lord
how
tired
i
am
accompanied
by
a
violent
yawn
when
at
length
they
arose
to
take
leave
mrs
bennet
was
most
pressingly
civil
in
her
hope
of
seeing
the
whole
family
soon
at
longbourn
and
addressed
herself
especially
to
mr
bingley
to
assure
him
how
happy
he
would
make
them
by
eating
a
family
dinner
with
them
at
any
time
without
the
ceremony
of
a
formal
invitation
bingley
was
all
grateful
pleasure
and
he
readily
engaged
for
taking
the
earliest
opportunity
of
waiting
on
her
after
his
return
from
london
whither
he
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
day
for
a
short
time
mrs
bennet
was
perfectly
satisfied
and
quitted
the
house
under
the
delightful
persuasion
that
allowing
for
the
necessary
preparations
of
settlements
new
carriages
and
wedding
clothes
she
should
undoubtedly
see
her
daughter
settled
at
netherfield
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
months
of
having
another
daughter
married
to
mr
collins
she
thought
with
equal
certainty
and
with
considerable
though
not
equal
pleasure
elizabeth
was
the
least
dear
to
her
of
all
her
children
and
though
the
man
and
the
match
were
quite
good
enough
for
her
the
worth
of
each
was
eclipsed
by
mr
bingley
and
netherfield
chapter
19
the
next
day
opened
a
new
scene
at
longbourn
mr
collins
made
his
declaration
in
form
having
resolved
to
do
it
without
loss
of
time
as
his
leave
of
absence
extended
only
to
the
following
saturday
and
having
no
feelings
of
diffidence
to
make
it
distressing
to
himself
even
at
the
moment
he
set
about
it
in
a
very
orderly
manner
with
all
the
observances
which
he
supposed
a
regular
part
of
the
business
on
finding
mrs
bennet
elizabeth
and
one
of
the
younger
girls
together
soon
after
breakfast
he
addressed
the
mother
in
these
words
may
i
hope
madam
for
your
interest
with
your
fair
daughter
elizabeth
when
i
solicit
for
the
honour
of
a
private
audience
with
her
in
the
course
of
this
morning
before
elizabeth
had
time
for
anything
but
a
blush
of
surprise
mrs
bennet
answered
instantly
oh
dear
yes
certainly
i
am
sure
lizzy
will
be
very
happy
i
am
sure
she
can
have
no
objection
come
kitty
i
want
you
up
stairs
and
gathering
her
work
together
she
was
hastening
away
when
elizabeth
called
out
dear
madam
do
not
go
i
beg
you
will
not
go
mr
collins
must
excuse
me
he
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
that
anybody
need
not
hear
i
am
going
away
myself
no
no
nonsense
lizzy
i
desire
you
to
stay
where
you
are
and
upon
elizabeth
s
seeming
really
with
vexed
and
embarrassed
looks
about
to
escape
she
added
lizzy
i
insist
upon
your
staying
and
hearing
mr
collins
elizabeth
would
not
oppose
such
an
injunction
and
a
moment
s
consideration
making
her
also
sensible
that
it
would
be
wisest
to
get
it
over
as
soon
and
as
quietly
as
possible
she
sat
down
again
and
tried
to
conceal
by
incessant
employment
the
feelings
which
were
divided
between
distress
and
diversion
mrs
bennet
and
kitty
walked
off
and
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
mr
collins
began
believe
me
my
dear
miss
elizabeth
that
your
modesty
so
far
from
doing
you
any
disservice
rather
adds
to
your
other
perfections
you
would
have
been
less
amiable
in
my
eyes
had
there
not
been
this
little
unwillingness
but
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
i
have
your
respected
mother
s
permission
for
this
address
you
can
hardly
doubt
the
purport
of
my
discourse
however
your
natural
delicacy
may
lead
you
to
dissemble
my
attentions
have
been
too
marked
to
be
mistaken
almost
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
house
i
singled
you
out
as
the
companion
of
my
future
life
but
before
i
am
run
away
with
by
my
feelings
on
this
subject
perhaps
it
would
be
advisable
for
me
to
state
my
reasons
for
marrying
and
moreover
for
coming
into
hertfordshire
with
the
design
of
selecting
a
wife
as
i
certainly
did
the
idea
of
mr
collins
with
all
his
solemn
composure
being
run
away
with
by
his
feelings
made
elizabeth
so
near
laughing
that
she
could
not
use
the
short
pause
he
allowed
in
any
attempt
to
stop
him
further
and
he
continued
my
reasons
for
marrying
are
first
that
i
think
it
a
right
thing
for
every
clergyman
in
easy
circumstances
like
myself
to
set
the
example
of
matrimony
in
his
parish
secondly
that
i
am
convinced
that
it
will
add
very
greatly
to
my
happiness
and
thirdly
which
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
earlier
that
it
is
the
particular
advice
and
recommendation
of
the
very
noble
lady
whom
i
have
the
honour
of
calling
patroness
twice
has
she
condescended
to
give
me
her
opinion
unasked
too
on
this
subject
and
it
was
but
the
very
saturday
night
before
i
left
hunsford
between
our
pools
at
quadrille
while
mrs
jenkinson
was
arranging
miss
de
bourgh
s
footstool
that
she
said
mr
collins
you
must
marry
a
clergyman
like
you
must
marry
choose
properly
choose
a
gentlewoman
for
my
sake
and
for
your
own
let
her
be
an
active
useful
sort
of
person
not
brought
up
high
but
able
to
make
a
small
income
go
a
good
way
this
is
my
advice
find
such
a
woman
as
soon
as
you
can
bring
her
to
hunsford
and
i
will
visit
her
allow
me
by
the
way
to
observe
my
fair
cousin
that
i
do
not
reckon
the
notice
and
kindness
of
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
as
among
the
least
of
the
advantages
in
my
power
to
offer
you
will
find
her
manners
beyond
anything
i
can
describe
and
your
wit
and
vivacity
i
think
must
be
acceptable
to
her
especially
when
tempered
with
the
silence
and
respect
which
her
rank
will
inevitably
excite
thus
much
for
my
general
intention
in
favour
of
matrimony
it
remains
to
be
told
why
my
views
were
directed
towards
longbourn
instead
of
my
own
neighbourhood
where
i
can
assure
you
there
are
many
amiable
young
women
but
the
fact
is
that
being
as
i
am
to
inherit
this
estate
after
the
death
of
your
honoured
father
who
however
may
live
many
years
longer
i
could
not
satisfy
myself
without
resolving
to
choose
a
wife
from
among
his
daughters
that
the
loss
to
them
might
be
as
little
as
possible
when
the
melancholy
event
takes
place
which
however
as
i
have
already
said
may
not
be
for
several
years
this
has
been
my
motive
my
fair
cousin
and
i
flatter
myself
it
will
not
sink
me
in
your
esteem
and
now
nothing
remains
for
me
but
to
assure
you
in
the
most
animated
language
of
the
violence
of
my
affection
to
fortune
i
am
perfectly
indifferent
and
shall
make
no
demand
of
that
nature
on
your
father
since
i
am
well
aware
that
it
could
not
be
complied
with
and
that
one
thousand
pounds
in
the
four
per
cents
which
will
not
be
yours
till
after
your
mother
s
decease
is
all
that
you
may
ever
be
entitled
to
on
that
head
therefore
i
shall
be
uniformly
silent
and
you
may
assure
yourself
that
no
ungenerous
reproach
shall
ever
pass
my
lips
when
we
are
married
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
interrupt
him
now
you
are
too
hasty
sir
she
cried
you
forget
that
i
have
made
no
answer
let
me
do
it
without
further
loss
of
time
accept
my
thanks
for
the
compliment
you
are
paying
me
i
am
very
sensible
of
the
honour
of
your
proposals
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
do
otherwise
than
to
decline
them
i
am
not
now
to
learn
replied
mr
collins
with
a
formal
wave
of
the
hand
that
it
is
usual
with
young
ladies
to
reject
the
addresses
of
the
man
whom
they
secretly
mean
to
accept
when
he
first
applies
for
their
favour
and
that
sometimes
the
refusal
is
repeated
a
second
or
even
a
third
time
i
am
therefore
by
no
means
discouraged
by
what
you
have
just
said
and
shall
hope
to
lead
you
to
the
altar
ere
long
upon
my
word
sir
cried
elizabeth
your
hope
is
a
rather
extraordinary
one
after
my
declaration
i
do
assure
you
that
i
am
not
one
of
those
young
ladies
if
such
young
ladies
there
are
who
are
so
daring
as
to
risk
their
happiness
on
the
chance
of
being
asked
a
second
time
i
am
perfectly
serious
in
my
refusal
you
could
not
make
me
happy
and
i
am
convinced
that
i
am
the
last
woman
in
the
world
who
could
make
you
so
nay
were
your
friend
lady
catherine
to
know
me
i
am
persuaded
she
would
find
me
in
every
respect
ill
qualified
for
the
situation
were
it
certain
that
lady
catherine
would
think
so
said
mr
collins
very
gravely
but
i
cannot
imagine
that
her
ladyship
would
at
all
disapprove
of
you
and
you
may
be
certain
when
i
have
the
honour
of
seeing
her
again
i
shall
speak
in
the
very
highest
terms
of
your
modesty
economy
and
other
amiable
qualification
indeed
mr
collins
all
praise
of
me
will
be
unnecessary
you
must
give
me
leave
to
judge
for
myself
and
pay
me
the
compliment
of
believing
what
i
say
i
wish
you
very
happy
and
very
rich
and
by
refusing
your
hand
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
your
being
otherwise
in
making
me
the
offer
you
must
have
satisfied
the
delicacy
of
your
feelings
with
regard
to
my
family
and
may
take
possession
of
longbourn
estate
whenever
it
falls
without
any
self
reproach
this
matter
may
be
considered
therefore
as
finally
settled
and
rising
as
she
thus
spoke
she
would
have
quitted
the
room
had
mr
collins
not
thus
addressed
her
when
i
do
myself
the
honour
of
speaking
to
you
next
on
the
subject
i
shall
hope
to
receive
a
more
favourable
answer
than
you
have
now
given
me
though
i
am
far
from
accusing
you
of
cruelty
at
present
because
i
know
it
to
be
the
established
custom
of
your
sex
to
reject
a
man
on
the
first
application
and
perhaps
you
have
even
now
said
as
much
to
encourage
my
suit
as
would
be
consistent
with
the
true
delicacy
of
the
female
character
really
mr
collins
cried
elizabeth
with
some
warmth
you
puzzle
me
exceedingly
if
what
i
have
hitherto
said
can
appear
to
you
in
the
form
of
encouragement
i
know
not
how
to
express
my
refusal
in
such
a
way
as
to
convince
you
of
its
being
one
you
must
give
me
leave
to
flatter
myself
my
dear
cousin
that
your
refusal
of
my
addresses
is
merely
words
of
course
my
reasons
for
believing
it
are
briefly
these
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
my
hand
is
unworthy
your
acceptance
or
that
the
establishment
i
can
offer
would
be
any
other
than
highly
desirable
my
situation
in
life
my
connections
with
the
family
of
de
bourgh
and
my
relationship
to
your
own
are
circumstances
highly
in
my
favour
and
you
should
take
it
into
further
consideration
that
in
spite
of
your
manifold
attractions
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
another
offer
of
marriage
may
ever
be
made
you
your
portion
is
unhappily
so
small
that
it
will
in
all
likelihood
undo
the
effects
of
your
loveliness
and
amiable
qualifications
as
i
must
therefore
conclude
that
you
are
not
serious
in
your
rejection
of
me
i
shall
choose
to
attribute
it
to
your
wish
of
increasing
my
love
by
suspense
according
to
the
usual
practice
of
elegant
females
i
do
assure
you
sir
that
i
have
no
pretensions
whatever
to
that
kind
of
elegance
which
consists
in
tormenting
a
respectable
man
i
would
rather
be
paid
the
compliment
of
being
believed
sincere
i
thank
you
again
and
again
for
the
honour
you
have
done
me
in
your
proposals
but
to
accept
them
is
absolutely
impossible
my
feelings
in
every
respect
forbid
it
can
i
speak
plainer
do
not
consider
me
now
as
an
elegant
female
intending
to
plague
you
but
as
a
rational
creature
speaking
the
truth
from
her
heart
you
are
uniformly
charming
cried
he
with
an
air
of
awkward
gallantry
and
i
am
persuaded
that
when
sanctioned
by
the
express
authority
of
both
your
excellent
parents
my
proposals
will
not
fail
of
being
acceptable
to
such
perseverance
in
wilful
self
deception
elizabeth
would
make
no
reply
and
immediately
and
in
silence
withdrew
determined
if
he
persisted
in
considering
her
repeated
refusals
as
flattering
encouragement
to
apply
to
her
father
whose
negative
might
be
uttered
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
decisive
and
whose
behaviour
at
least
could
not
be
mistaken
for
the
affectation
and
coquetry
of
an
elegant
female
chapter

mr
collins
was
not
left
long
to
the
silent
contemplation
of
his
successful
love
for
mrs
bennet
having
dawdled
about
in
the
vestibule
to
watch
for
the
end
of
the
conference
no
sooner
saw
elizabeth
open
the
door
and
with
quick
step
pass
her
towards
the
staircase
than
she
entered
the
breakfast
room
and
congratulated
both
him
and
herself
in
warm
terms
on
the
happy
prospect
or
their
nearer
connection
mr
collins
received
and
returned
these
felicitations
with
equal
pleasure
and
then
proceeded
to
relate
the
particulars
of
their
interview
with
the
result
of
which
he
trusted
he
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
since
the
refusal
which
his
cousin
had
steadfastly
given
him
would
naturally
flow
from
her
bashful
modesty
and
the
genuine
delicacy
of
her
character
this
information
however
startled
mrs
bennet
she
would
have
been
glad
to
be
equally
satisfied
that
her
daughter
had
meant
to
encourage
him
by
protesting
against
his
proposals
but
she
dared
not
believe
it
and
could
not
help
saying
so
but
depend
upon
it
mr
collins
she
added
that
lizzy
shall
be
brought
to
reason
i
will
speak
to
her
about
it
directly
she
is
a
very
headstrong
foolish
girl
and
does
not
know
her
own
interest
but
i
will
make
her
know
it
pardon
me
for
interrupting
you
madam
cried
mr
collins
but
if
she
is
really
headstrong
and
foolish
i
know
not
whether
she
would
altogether
be
a
very
desirable
wife
to
a
man
in
my
situation
who
naturally
looks
for
happiness
in
the
marriage
state
if
therefore
she
actually
persists
in
rejecting
my
suit
perhaps
it
were
better
not
to
force
her
into
accepting
me
because
if
liable
to
such
defects
of
temper
she
could
not
contribute
much
to
my
felicity
sir
you
quite
misunderstand
me
said
mrs
bennet
alarmed
lizzy
is
only
headstrong
in
such
matters
as
these
in
everything
else
she
is
as
good
natured
a
girl
as
ever
lived
i
will
go
directly
to
mr
bennet
and
we
shall
very
soon
settle
it
with
her
i
am
sure
she
would
not
give
him
time
to
reply
but
hurrying
instantly
to
her
husband
called
out
as
she
entered
the
library
oh
mr
bennet
you
are
wanted
immediately
we
are
all
in
an
uproar
you
must
come
and
make
lizzy
marry
mr
collins
for
she
vows
she
will
not
have
him
and
if
you
do
not
make
haste
he
will
change
his
mind
and
not
have
her
mr
bennet
raised
his
eyes
from
his
book
as
she
entered
and
fixed
them
on
her
face
with
a
calm
unconcern
which
was
not
in
the
least
altered
by
her
communication
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
understanding
you
said
he
when
she
had
finished
her
speech
of
what
are
you
talking
of
mr
collins
and
lizzy
lizzy
declares
she
will
not
have
mr
collins
and
mr
collins
begins
to
say
that
he
will
not
have
lizzy
and
what
am
i
to
do
on
the
occasion
it
seems
an
hopeless
business
speak
to
lizzy
about
it
yourself
tell
her
that
you
insist
upon
her
marrying
him
let
her
be
called
down
she
shall
hear
my
opinion
mrs
bennet
rang
the
bell
and
miss
elizabeth
was
summoned
to
the
library
come
here
child
cried
her
father
as
she
appeared
i
have
sent
for
you
on
an
affair
of
importance
i
understand
that
mr
collins
has
made
you
an
offer
of
marriage
is
it
true
elizabeth
replied
that
it
was
very
well
and
this
offer
of
marriage
you
have
refused
i
have
sir
very
well
we
now
come
to
the
point
your
mother
insists
upon
your
accepting
it
is
it
not
so
mrs
bennet
yes
or
i
will
never
see
her
again
an
unhappy
alternative
is
before
you
elizabeth
from
this
day
you
must
be
a
stranger
to
one
of
your
parents
your
mother
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
not
marry
mr
collins
and
i
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
elizabeth
could
not
but
smile
at
such
a
conclusion
of
such
a
beginning
but
mrs
bennet
who
had
persuaded
herself
that
her
husband
regarded
the
affair
as
she
wished
was
excessively
disappointed
what
do
you
mean
mr
bennet
in
talking
this
way
you
promised
me
to
insist
upon
her
marrying
him
my
dear
replied
her
husband
i
have
two
small
favours
to
request
first
that
you
will
allow
me
the
free
use
of
my
understanding
on
the
present
occasion
and
secondly
of
my
room
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
the
library
to
myself
as
soon
as
may
be
not
yet
however
in
spite
of
her
disappointment
in
her
husband
did
mrs
bennet
give
up
the
point
she
talked
to
elizabeth
again
and
again
coaxed
and
threatened
her
by
turns
she
endeavoured
to
secure
jane
in
her
interest
but
jane
with
all
possible
mildness
declined
interfering
and
elizabeth
sometimes
with
real
earnestness
and
sometimes
with
playful
gaiety
replied
to
her
attacks
though
her
manner
varied
however
her
determination
never
did
mr
collins
meanwhile
was
meditating
in
solitude
on
what
had
passed
he
thought
too
well
of
himself
to
comprehend
on
what
motives
his
cousin
could
refuse
him
and
though
his
pride
was
hurt
he
suffered
in
no
other
way
his
regard
for
her
was
quite
imaginary
and
the
possibility
of
her
deserving
her
mother
s
reproach
prevented
his
feeling
any
regret
while
the
family
were
in
this
confusion
charlotte
lucas
came
to
spend
the
day
with
them
she
was
met
in
the
vestibule
by
lydia
who
flying
to
her
cried
in
a
half
whisper
i
am
glad
you
are
come
for
there
is
such
fun
here
what
do
you
think
has
happened
this
morning
mr
collins
has
made
an
offer
to
lizzy
and
she
will
not
have
him
charlotte
hardly
had
time
to
answer
before
they
were
joined
by
kitty
who
came
to
tell
the
same
news
and
no
sooner
had
they
entered
the
breakfast
room
where
mrs
bennet
was
alone
than
she
likewise
began
on
the
subject
calling
on
miss
lucas
for
her
compassion
and
entreating
her
to
persuade
her
friend
lizzy
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
all
her
family
pray
do
my
dear
miss
lucas
she
added
in
a
melancholy
tone
for
nobody
is
on
my
side
nobody
takes
part
with
me
i
am
cruelly
used
nobody
feels
for
my
poor
nerves
charlotte
s
reply
was
spared
by
the
entrance
of
jane
and
elizabeth
aye
there
she
comes
continued
mrs
bennet
looking
as
unconcerned
as
may
be
and
caring
no
more
for
us
than
if
we
were
at
york
provided
she
can
have
her
own
way
but
i
tell
you
miss
lizzy
if
you
take
it
into
your
head
to
go
on
refusing
every
offer
of
marriage
in
this
way
you
will
never
get
a
husband
at
all
and
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
who
is
to
maintain
you
when
your
father
is
dead
i
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
you
and
so
i
warn
you
i
have
done
with
you
from
this
very
day
i
told
you
in
the
library
you
know
that
i
should
never
speak
to
you
again
and
you
will
find
me
as
good
as
my
word
i
have
no
pleasure
in
talking
to
undutiful
children
not
that
i
have
much
pleasure
indeed
in
talking
to
anybody
people
who
suffer
as
i
do
from
nervous
complaints
can
have
no
great
inclination
for
talking
nobody
can
tell
what
i
suffer
but
it
is
always
so
those
who
do
not
complain
are
never
pitied
her
daughters
listened
in
silence
to
this
effusion
sensible
that
any
attempt
to
reason
with
her
or
soothe
her
would
only
increase
the
irritation
she
talked
on
therefore
without
interruption
from
any
of
them
till
they
were
joined
by
mr
collins
who
entered
the
room
with
an
air
more
stately
than
usual
and
on
perceiving
whom
she
said
to
the
girls
now
i
do
insist
upon
it
that
you
all
of
you
hold
your
tongues
and
let
me
and
mr
collins
have
a
little
conversation
together
elizabeth
passed
quietly
out
of
the
room
jane
and
kitty
followed
but
lydia
stood
her
ground
determined
to
hear
all
she
could
and
charlotte
detained
first
by
the
civility
of
mr
collins
whose
inquiries
after
herself
and
all
her
family
were
very
minute
and
then
by
a
little
curiosity
satisfied
herself
with
walking
to
the
window
and
pretending
not
to
hear
in
a
doleful
voice
mrs
bennet
began
the
projected
conversation
oh
mr
collins
my
dear
madam
replied
he
let
us
be
for
ever
silent
on
this
point
far
be
it
from
me
he
presently
continued
in
a
voice
that
marked
his
displeasure
to
resent
the
behaviour
of
your
daughter
resignation
to
inevitable
evils
is
the
duty
of
us
all
the
peculiar
duty
of
a
young
man
who
has
been
so
fortunate
as
i
have
been
in
early
preferment
and
i
trust
i
am
resigned
perhaps
not
the
less
so
from
feeling
a
doubt
of
my
positive
happiness
had
my
fair
cousin
honoured
me
with
her
hand
for
i
have
often
observed
that
resignation
is
never
so
perfect
as
when
the
blessing
denied
begins
to
lose
somewhat
of
its
value
in
our
estimation
you
will
not
i
hope
consider
me
as
showing
any
disrespect
to
your
family
my
dear
madam
by
thus
withdrawing
my
pretensions
to
your
daughter
s
favour
without
having
paid
yourself
and
mr
bennet
the
compliment
of
requesting
you
to
interpose
your
authority
in
my
behalf
my
conduct
may
i
fear
be
objectionable
in
having
accepted
my
dismission
from
your
daughter
s
lips
instead
of
your
own
but
we
are
all
liable
to
error
i
have
certainly
meant
well
through
the
whole
affair
my
object
has
been
to
secure
an
amiable
companion
for
myself
with
due
consideration
for
the
advantage
of
all
your
family
and
if
my
manner
has
been
at
all
reprehensible
i
here
beg
leave
to
apologise
chapter
21
the
discussion
of
mr
collins
s
offer
was
now
nearly
at
an
end
and
elizabeth
had
only
to
suffer
from
the
uncomfortable
feelings
necessarily
attending
it
and
occasionally
from
some
peevish
allusions
of
her
mother
as
for
the
gentleman
himself
his
feelings
were
chiefly
expressed
not
by
embarrassment
or
dejection
or
by
trying
to
avoid
her
but
by
stiffness
of
manner
and
resentful
silence
he
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
her
and
the
assiduous
attentions
which
he
had
been
so
sensible
of
himself
were
transferred
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
miss
lucas
whose
civility
in
listening
to
him
was
a
seasonable
relief
to
them
all
and
especially
to
her
friend
the
morrow
produced
no
abatement
of
mrs
bennet
s
ill
humour
or
ill
health
mr
collins
was
also
in
the
same
state
of
angry
pride
elizabeth
had
hoped
that
his
resentment
might
shorten
his
visit
but
his
plan
did
not
appear
in
the
least
affected
by
it
he
was
always
to
have
gone
on
saturday
and
to
saturday
he
meant
to
stay
after
breakfast
the
girls
walked
to
meryton
to
inquire
if
mr
wickham
were
returned
and
to
lament
over
his
absence
from
the
netherfield
ball
he
joined
them
on
their
entering
the
town
and
attended
them
to
their
aunt
s
where
his
regret
and
vexation
and
the
concern
of
everybody
was
well
talked
over
to
elizabeth
however
he
voluntarily
acknowledged
that
the
necessity
of
his
absence
had
been
self
imposed
i
found
said
he
as
the
time
drew
near
that
i
had
better
not
meet
mr
darcy
that
to
be
in
the
same
room
the
same
party
with
him
for
so
many
hours
together
might
be
more
than
i
could
bear
and
that
scenes
might
arise
unpleasant
to
more
than
myself
she
highly
approved
his
forbearance
and
they
had
leisure
for
a
full
discussion
of
it
and
for
all
the
commendation
which
they
civilly
bestowed
on
each
other
as
wickham
and
another
officer
walked
back
with
them
to
longbourn
and
during
the
walk
he
particularly
attended
to
her
his
accompanying
them
was
a
double
advantage
she
felt
all
the
compliment
it
offered
to
herself
and
it
was
most
acceptable
as
an
occasion
of
introducing
him
to
her
father
and
mother
soon
after
their
return
a
letter
was
delivered
to
miss
bennet
it
came
from
netherfield
the
envelope
contained
a
sheet
of
elegant
little
hot
pressed
paper
well
covered
with
a
lady
s
fair
flowing
hand
and
elizabeth
saw
her
sister
s
countenance
change
as
she
read
it
and
saw
her
dwelling
intently
on
some
particular
passages
jane
recollected
herself
soon
and
putting
the
letter
away
tried
to
join
with
her
usual
cheerfulness
in
the
general
conversation
but
elizabeth
felt
an
anxiety
on
the
subject
which
drew
off
her
attention
even
from
wickham
and
no
sooner
had
he
and
his
companion
taken
leave
than
a
glance
from
jane
invited
her
to
follow
her
up
stairs
when
they
had
gained
their
own
room
jane
taking
out
the
letter
said
this
is
from
caroline
bingley
what
it
contains
has
surprised
me
a
good
deal
the
whole
party
have
left
netherfield
by
this
time
and
are
on
their
way
to
town
and
without
any
intention
of
coming
back
again
you
shall
hear
what
she
says
she
then
read
the
first
sentence
aloud
which
comprised
the
information
of
their
having
just
resolved
to
follow
their
brother
to
town
directly
and
of
their
meaning
to
dine
in
grosvenor
street
where
mr
hurst
had
a
house
the
next
was
in
these
words
i
do
not
pretend
to
regret
anything
i
shall
leave
in
hertfordshire
except
your
society
my
dearest
friend
but
we
will
hope
at
some
future
period
to
enjoy
many
returns
of
that
delightful
intercourse
we
have
known
and
in
the
meanwhile
may
lessen
the
pain
of
separation
by
a
very
frequent
and
most
unreserved
correspondence
i
depend
on
you
for
that
to
these
highflown
expressions
elizabeth
listened
with
all
the
insensibility
of
distrust
and
though
the
suddenness
of
their
removal
surprised
her
she
saw
nothing
in
it
really
to
lament
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
their
absence
from
netherfield
would
prevent
mr
bingley
s
being
there
and
as
to
the
loss
of
their
society
she
was
persuaded
that
jane
must
cease
to
regard
it
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
it
is
unlucky
said
she
after
a
short
pause
that
you
should
not
be
able
to
see
your
friends
before
they
leave
the
country
but
may
we
not
hope
that
the
period
of
future
happiness
to
which
miss
bingley
looks
forward
may
arrive
earlier
than
she
is
aware
and
that
the
delightful
intercourse
you
have
known
as
friends
will
be
renewed
with
yet
greater
satisfaction
as
sisters
mr
bingley
will
not
be
detained
in
london
by
them
caroline
decidedly
says
that
none
of
the
party
will
return
into
hertfordshire
this
winter
i
will
read
it
to
you
when
my
brother
left
us
yesterday
he
imagined
that
the
business
which
took
him
to
london
might
be
concluded
in
three
or
four
days
but
as
we
are
certain
it
cannot
be
so
and
at
the
same
time
convinced
that
when
charles
gets
to
town
he
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
again
we
have
determined
on
following
him
thither
that
he
may
not
be
obliged
to
spend
his
vacant
hours
in
a
comfortless
hotel
many
of
my
acquaintances
are
already
there
for
the
winter
i
wish
that
i
could
hear
that
you
my
dearest
friend
had
any
intention
of
making
one
of
the
crowd
but
of
that
i
despair
i
sincerely
hope
your
christmas
in
hertfordshire
may
abound
in
the
gaieties
which
that
season
generally
brings
and
that
your
beaux
will
be
so
numerous
as
to
prevent
your
feeling
the
loss
of
the
three
of
whom
we
shall
deprive
you
it
is
evident
by
this
added
jane
that
he
comes
back
no
more
this
winter
it
is
only
evident
that
miss
bingley
does
not
mean
that
he
should
why
will
you
think
so
it
must
be
his
own
doing
he
is
his
own
master
but
you
do
not
know
all
i
will
read
you
the
passage
which
particularly
hurts
me
i
will
have
no
reserves
from
you
mr
darcy
is
impatient
to
see
his
sister
and
to
confess
the
truth
we
are
scarcely
less
eager
to
meet
her
again
i
really
do
not
think
georgiana
darcy
has
her
equal
for
beauty
elegance
and
accomplishments
and
the
affection
she
inspires
in
louisa
and
myself
is
heightened
into
something
still
more
interesting
from
the
hope
we
dare
entertain
of
her
being
hereafter
our
sister
i
do
not
know
whether
i
ever
before
mentioned
to
you
my
feelings
on
this
subject
but
i
will
not
leave
the
country
without
confiding
them
and
i
trust
you
will
not
esteem
them
unreasonable
my
brother
admires
her
greatly
already
he
will
have
frequent
opportunity
now
of
seeing
her
on
the
most
intimate
footing
her
relations
all
wish
the
connection
as
much
as
his
own
and
a
sister
s
partiality
is
not
misleading
me
i
think
when
i
call
charles
most
capable
of
engaging
any
woman
s
heart
with
all
these
circumstances
to
favour
an
attachment
and
nothing
to
prevent
it
am
i
wrong
my
dearest
jane
in
indulging
the
hope
of
an
event
which
will
secure
the
happiness
of
so
many
what
do
you
think
of
this
sentence
my
dear
lizzy
said
jane
as
she
finished
it
is
it
not
clear
enough
does
it
not
expressly
declare
that
caroline
neither
expects
nor
wishes
me
to
be
her
sister
that
she
is
perfectly
convinced
of
her
brother
s
indifference
and
that
if
she
suspects
the
nature
of
my
feelings
for
him
she
means
most
kindly
to
put
me
on
my
guard
can
there
be
any
other
opinion
on
the
subject
yes
there
can
for
mine
is
totally
different
will
you
hear
it
most
willingly
you
shall
have
it
in
a
few
words
miss
bingley
sees
that
her
brother
is
in
love
with
you
and
wants
him
to
marry
miss
darcy
she
follows
him
to
town
in
hope
of
keeping
him
there
and
tries
to
persuade
you
that
he
does
not
care
about
you
jane
shook
her
head
indeed
jane
you
ought
to
believe
me
no
one
who
has
ever
seen
you
together
can
doubt
his
affection
miss
bingley
i
am
sure
cannot
she
is
not
such
a
simpleton
could
she
have
seen
half
as
much
love
in
mr
darcy
for
herself
she
would
have
ordered
her
wedding
clothes
but
the
case
is
this
we
are
not
rich
enough
or
grand
enough
for
them
and
she
is
the
more
anxious
to
get
miss
darcy
for
her
brother
from
the
notion
that
when
there
has
been
one
intermarriage
she
may
have
less
trouble
in
achieving
a
second
in
which
there
is
certainly
some
ingenuity
and
i
dare
say
it
would
succeed
if
miss
de
bourgh
were
out
of
the
way
but
my
dearest
jane
you
cannot
seriously
imagine
that
because
miss
bingley
tells
you
her
brother
greatly
admires
miss
darcy
he
is
in
the
smallest
degree
less
sensible
of
your
merit
than
when
he
took
leave
of
you
on
tuesday
or
that
it
will
be
in
her
power
to
persuade
him
that
instead
of
being
in
love
with
you
he
is
very
much
in
love
with
her
friend
if
we
thought
alike
of
miss
bingley
replied
jane
your
representation
of
all
this
might
make
me
quite
easy
but
i
know
the
foundation
is
unjust
caroline
is
incapable
of
wilfully
deceiving
anyone
and
all
that
i
can
hope
in
this
case
is
that
she
is
deceiving
herself
that
is
right
you
could
not
have
started
a
more
happy
idea
since
you
will
not
take
comfort
in
mine
believe
her
to
be
deceived
by
all
means
you
have
now
done
your
duty
by
her
and
must
fret
no
longer
but
my
dear
sister
can
i
be
happy
even
supposing
the
best
in
accepting
a
man
whose
sisters
and
friends
are
all
wishing
him
to
marry
elsewhere
you
must
decide
for
yourself
said
elizabeth
and
if
upon
mature
deliberation
you
find
that
the
misery
of
disobliging
his
two
sisters
is
more
than
equivalent
to
the
happiness
of
being
his
wife
i
advise
you
by
all
means
to
refuse
him
how
can
you
talk
so
said
jane
faintly
smiling
you
must
know
that
though
i
should
be
exceedingly
grieved
at
their
disapprobation
i
could
not
hesitate
i
did
not
think
you
would
and
that
being
the
case
i
cannot
consider
your
situation
with
much
compassion
but
if
he
returns
no
more
this
winter
my
choice
will
never
be
required
a
thousand
things
may
arise
in
six
months
the
idea
of
his
returning
no
more
elizabeth
treated
with
the
utmost
contempt
it
appeared
to
her
merely
the
suggestion
of
caroline
s
interested
wishes
and
she
could
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
those
wishes
however
openly
or
artfully
spoken
could
influence
a
young
man
so
totally
independent
of
everyone
she
represented
to
her
sister
as
forcibly
as
possible
what
she
felt
on
the
subject
and
had
soon
the
pleasure
of
seeing
its
happy
effect
jane
s
temper
was
not
desponding
and
she
was
gradually
led
to
hope
though
the
diffidence
of
affection
sometimes
overcame
the
hope
that
bingley
would
return
to
netherfield
and
answer
every
wish
of
her
heart
they
agreed
that
mrs
bennet
should
only
hear
of
the
departure
of
the
family
without
being
alarmed
on
the
score
of
the
gentleman
s
conduct
but
even
this
partial
communication
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
concern
and
she
bewailed
it
as
exceedingly
unlucky
that
the
ladies
should
happen
to
go
away
just
as
they
were
all
getting
so
intimate
together
after
lamenting
it
however
at
some
length
she
had
the
consolation
that
mr
bingley
would
be
soon
down
again
and
soon
dining
at
longbourn
and
the
conclusion
of
all
was
the
comfortable
declaration
that
though
he
had
been
invited
only
to
a
family
dinner
she
would
take
care
to
have
two
full
courses
chapter
22
the
bennets
were
engaged
to
dine
with
the
lucases
and
again
during
the
chief
of
the
day
was
miss
lucas
so
kind
as
to
listen
to
mr
collins
elizabeth
took
an
opportunity
of
thanking
her
it
keeps
him
in
good
humour
said
she
and
i
am
more
obliged
to
you
than
i
can
express
charlotte
assured
her
friend
of
her
satisfaction
in
being
useful
and
that
it
amply
repaid
her
for
the
little
sacrifice
of
her
time
this
was
very
amiable
but
charlotte
s
kindness
extended
farther
than
elizabeth
had
any
conception
of
its
object
was
nothing
else
than
to
secure
her
from
any
return
of
mr
collins
s
addresses
by
engaging
them
towards
herself
such
was
miss
lucas
s
scheme
and
appearances
were
so
favourable
that
when
they
parted
at
night
she
would
have
felt
almost
secure
of
success
if
he
had
not
been
to
leave
hertfordshire
so
very
soon
but
here
she
did
injustice
to
the
fire
and
independence
of
his
character
for
it
led
him
to
escape
out
of
longbourn
house
the
next
morning
with
admirable
slyness
and
hasten
to
lucas
lodge
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
he
was
anxious
to
avoid
the
notice
of
his
cousins
from
a
conviction
that
if
they
saw
him
depart
they
could
not
fail
to
conjecture
his
design
and
he
was
not
willing
to
have
the
attempt
known
till
its
success
might
be
known
likewise
for
though
feeling
almost
secure
and
with
reason
for
charlotte
had
been
tolerably
encouraging
he
was
comparatively
diffident
since
the
adventure
of
wednesday
his
reception
however
was
of
the
most
flattering
kind
miss
lucas
perceived
him
from
an
upper
window
as
he
walked
towards
the
house
and
instantly
set
out
to
meet
him
accidentally
in
the
lane
but
little
had
she
dared
to
hope
that
so
much
love
and
eloquence
awaited
her
there
in
as
short
a
time
as
mr
collins
s
long
speeches
would
allow
everything
was
settled
between
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
and
as
they
entered
the
house
he
earnestly
entreated
her
to
name
the
day
that
was
to
make
him
the
happiest
of
men
and
though
such
a
solicitation
must
be
waived
for
the
present
the
lady
felt
no
inclination
to
trifle
with
his
happiness
the
stupidity
with
which
he
was
favoured
by
nature
must
guard
his
courtship
from
any
charm
that
could
make
a
woman
wish
for
its
continuance
and
miss
lucas
who
accepted
him
solely
from
the
pure
and
disinterested
desire
of
an
establishment
cared
not
how
soon
that
establishment
were
gained
sir
william
and
lady
lucas
were
speedily
applied
to
for
their
consent
and
it
was
bestowed
with
a
most
joyful
alacrity
mr
collins
s
present
circumstances
made
it
a
most
eligible
match
for
their
daughter
to
whom
they
could
give
little
fortune
and
his
prospects
of
future
wealth
were
exceedingly
fair
lady
lucas
began
directly
to
calculate
with
more
interest
than
the
matter
had
ever
excited
before
how
many
years
longer
mr
bennet
was
likely
to
live
and
sir
william
gave
it
as
his
decided
opinion
that
whenever
mr
collins
should
be
in
possession
of
the
longbourn
estate
it
would
be
highly
expedient
that
both
he
and
his
wife
should
make
their
appearance
at
st
james
s
the
whole
family
in
short
were
properly
overjoyed
on
the
occasion
the
younger
girls
formed
hopes
of
coming
out
a
year
or
two
sooner
than
they
might
otherwise
have
done
and
the
boys
were
relieved
from
their
apprehension
of
charlotte
s
dying
an
old
maid
charlotte
herself
was
tolerably
composed
she
had
gained
her
point
and
had
time
to
consider
of
it
her
reflections
were
in
general
satisfactory
mr
collins
to
be
sure
was
neither
sensible
nor
agreeable
his
society
was
irksome
and
his
attachment
to
her
must
be
imaginary
but
still
he
would
be
her
husband
without
thinking
highly
either
of
men
or
matrimony
marriage
had
always
been
her
object
it
was
the
only
provision
for
well
educated
young
women
of
small
fortune
and
however
uncertain
of
giving
happiness
must
be
their
pleasantest
preservative
from
want
this
preservative
she
had
now
obtained
and
at
the
age
of
twenty
seven
without
having
ever
been
handsome
she
felt
all
the
good
luck
of
it
the
least
agreeable
circumstance
in
the
business
was
the
surprise
it
must
occasion
to
elizabeth
bennet
whose
friendship
she
valued
beyond
that
of
any
other
person
elizabeth
would
wonder
and
probably
would
blame
her
and
though
her
resolution
was
not
to
be
shaken
her
feelings
must
be
hurt
by
such
a
disapprobation
she
resolved
to
give
her
the
information
herself
and
therefore
charged
mr
collins
when
he
returned
to
longbourn
to
dinner
to
drop
no
hint
of
what
had
passed
before
any
of
the
family
a
promise
of
secrecy
was
of
course
very
dutifully
given
but
it
could
not
be
kept
without
difficulty
for
the
curiosity
excited
by
his
long
absence
burst
forth
in
such
very
direct
questions
on
his
return
as
required
some
ingenuity
to
evade
and
he
was
at
the
same
time
exercising
great
self
denial
for
he
was
longing
to
publish
his
prosperous
love
as
he
was
to
begin
his
journey
too
early
on
the
morrow
to
see
any
of
the
family
the
ceremony
of
leave
taking
was
performed
when
the
ladies
moved
for
the
night
and
mrs
bennet
with
great
politeness
and
cordiality
said
how
happy
they
should
be
to
see
him
at
longbourn
again
whenever
his
engagements
might
allow
him
to
visit
them
my
dear
madam
he
replied
this
invitation
is
particularly
gratifying
because
it
is
what
i
have
been
hoping
to
receive
and
you
may
be
very
certain
that
i
shall
avail
myself
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
they
were
all
astonished
and
mr
bennet
who
could
by
no
means
wish
for
so
speedy
a
return
immediately
said
but
is
there
not
danger
of
lady
catherine
s
disapprobation
here
my
good
sir
you
had
better
neglect
your
relations
than
run
the
risk
of
offending
your
patroness
my
dear
sir
replied
mr
collins
i
am
particularly
obliged
to
you
for
this
friendly
caution
and
you
may
depend
upon
my
not
taking
so
material
a
step
without
her
ladyship
s
concurrence
you
cannot
be
too
much
upon
your
guard
risk
anything
rather
than
her
displeasure
and
if
you
find
it
likely
to
be
raised
by
your
coming
to
us
again
which
i
should
think
exceedingly
probable
stay
quietly
at
home
and
be
satisfied
that
we
shall
take
no
offence
believe
me
my
dear
sir
my
gratitude
is
warmly
excited
by
such
affectionate
attention
and
depend
upon
it
you
will
speedily
receive
from
me
a
letter
of
thanks
for
this
and
for
every
other
mark
of
your
regard
during
my
stay
in
hertfordshire
as
for
my
fair
cousins
though
my
absence
may
not
be
long
enough
to
render
it
necessary
i
shall
now
take
the
liberty
of
wishing
them
health
and
happiness
not
excepting
my
cousin
elizabeth
with
proper
civilities
the
ladies
then
withdrew
all
of
them
equally
surprised
that
he
meditated
a
quick
return
mrs
bennet
wished
to
understand
by
it
that
he
thought
of
paying
his
addresses
to
one
of
her
younger
girls
and
mary
might
have
been
prevailed
on
to
accept
him
she
rated
his
abilities
much
higher
than
any
of
the
others
there
was
a
solidity
in
his
reflections
which
often
struck
her
and
though
by
no
means
so
clever
as
herself
she
thought
that
if
encouraged
to
read
and
improve
himself
by
such
an
example
as
hers
he
might
become
a
very
agreeable
companion
but
on
the
following
morning
every
hope
of
this
kind
was
done
away
miss
lucas
called
soon
after
breakfast
and
in
a
private
conference
with
elizabeth
related
the
event
of
the
day
before
the
possibility
of
mr
collins
s
fancying
himself
in
love
with
her
friend
had
once
occurred
to
elizabeth
within
the
last
day
or
two
but
that
charlotte
could
encourage
him
seemed
almost
as
far
from
possibility
as
she
could
encourage
him
herself
and
her
astonishment
was
consequently
so
great
as
to
overcome
at
first
the
bounds
of
decorum
and
she
could
not
help
crying
out
engaged
to
mr
collins
my
dear
charlotte
impossible
the
steady
countenance
which
miss
lucas
had
commanded
in
telling
her
story
gave
way
to
a
momentary
confusion
here
on
receiving
so
direct
a
reproach
though
as
it
was
no
more
than
she
expected
she
soon
regained
her
composure
and
calmly
replied
why
should
you
be
surprised
my
dear
eliza
do
you
think
it
incredible
that
mr
collins
should
be
able
to
procure
any
woman
s
good
opinion
because
he
was
not
so
happy
as
to
succeed
with
you
but
elizabeth
had
now
recollected
herself
and
making
a
strong
effort
for
it
was
able
to
assure
with
tolerable
firmness
that
the
prospect
of
their
relationship
was
highly
grateful
to
her
and
that
she
wished
her
all
imaginable
happiness
i
see
what
you
are
feeling
replied
charlotte
you
must
be
surprised
very
much
surprised
so
lately
as
mr
collins
was
wishing
to
marry
you
but
when
you
have
had
time
to
think
it
over
i
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
with
what
i
have
done
i
am
not
romantic
you
know
i
never
was
i
ask
only
a
comfortable
home
and
considering
mr
collins
s
character
connection
and
situation
in
life
i
am
convinced
that
my
chance
of
happiness
with
him
is
as
fair
as
most
people
can
boast
on
entering
the
marriage
state
elizabeth
quietly
answered
undoubtedly
and
after
an
awkward
pause
they
returned
to
the
rest
of
the
family
charlotte
did
not
stay
much
longer
and
elizabeth
was
then
left
to
reflect
on
what
she
had
heard
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
became
at
all
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
so
unsuitable
a
match
the
strangeness
of
mr
collins
s
making
two
offers
of
marriage
within
three
days
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
his
being
now
accepted
she
had
always
felt
that
charlotte
s
opinion
of
matrimony
was
not
exactly
like
her
own
but
she
had
not
supposed
it
to
be
possible
that
when
called
into
action
she
would
have
sacrificed
every
better
feeling
to
worldly
advantage
charlotte
the
wife
of
mr
collins
was
a
most
humiliating
picture
and
to
the
pang
of
a
friend
disgracing
herself
and
sunk
in
her
esteem
was
added
the
distressing
conviction
that
it
was
impossible
for
that
friend
to
be
tolerably
happy
in
the
lot
she
had
chosen
chapter
23
elizabeth
was
sitting
with
her
mother
and
sisters
reflecting
on
what
she
had
heard
and
doubting
whether
she
was
authorised
to
mention
it
when
sir
william
lucas
himself
appeared
sent
by
his
daughter
to
announce
her
engagement
to
the
family
with
many
compliments
to
them
and
much
self
gratulation
on
the
prospect
of
a
connection
between
the
houses
he
unfolded
the
matter
to
an
audience
not
merely
wondering
but
incredulous
for
mrs
bennet
with
more
perseverance
than
politeness
protested
he
must
be
entirely
mistaken
and
lydia
always
unguarded
and
often
uncivil
boisterously
exclaimed
good
lord
sir
william
how
can
you
tell
such
a
story
do
not
you
know
that
mr
collins
wants
to
marry
lizzy
nothing
less
than
the
complaisance
of
a
courtier
could
have
borne
without
anger
such
treatment
but
sir
william
s
good
breeding
carried
him
through
it
all
and
though
he
begged
leave
to
be
positive
as
to
the
truth
of
his
information
he
listened
to
all
their
impertinence
with
the
most
forbearing
courtesy
elizabeth
feeling
it
incumbent
on
her
to
relieve
him
from
so
unpleasant
a
situation
now
put
herself
forward
to
confirm
his
account
by
mentioning
her
prior
knowledge
of
it
from
charlotte
herself
and
endeavoured
to
put
a
stop
to
the
exclamations
of
her
mother
and
sisters
by
the
earnestness
of
her
congratulations
to
sir
william
in
which
she
was
readily
joined
by
jane
and
by
making
a
variety
of
remarks
on
the
happiness
that
might
be
expected
from
the
match
the
excellent
character
of
mr
collins
and
the
convenient
distance
of
hunsford
from
london
mrs
bennet
was
in
fact
too
much
overpowered
to
say
a
great
deal
while
sir
william
remained
but
no
sooner
had
he
left
them
than
her
feelings
found
a
rapid
vent
in
the
first
place
she
persisted
in
disbelieving
the
whole
of
the
matter
secondly
she
was
very
sure
that
mr
collins
had
been
taken
in
thirdly
she
trusted
that
they
would
never
be
happy
together
and
fourthly
that
the
match
might
be
broken
off
two
inferences
however
were
plainly
deduced
from
the
whole
one
that
elizabeth
was
the
real
cause
of
the
mischief
and
the
other
that
she
herself
had
been
barbarously
misused
by
them
all
and
on
these
two
points
she
principally
dwelt
during
the
rest
of
the
day
nothing
could
console
and
nothing
could
appease
her
nor
did
that
day
wear
out
her
resentment
a
week
elapsed
before
she
could
see
elizabeth
without
scolding
her
a
month
passed
away
before
she
could
speak
to
sir
william
or
lady
lucas
without
being
rude
and
many
months
were
gone
before
she
could
at
all
forgive
their
daughter
mr
bennet
s
emotions
were
much
more
tranquil
on
the
occasion
and
such
as
he
did
experience
he
pronounced
to
be
of
a
most
agreeable
sort
for
it
gratified
him
he
said
to
discover
that
charlotte
lucas
whom
he
had
been
used
to
think
tolerably
sensible
was
as
foolish
as
his
wife
and
more
foolish
than
his
daughter
jane
confessed
herself
a
little
surprised
at
the
match
but
she
said
less
of
her
astonishment
than
of
her
earnest
desire
for
their
happiness
nor
could
elizabeth
persuade
her
to
consider
it
as
improbable
kitty
and
lydia
were
far
from
envying
miss
lucas
for
mr
collins
was
only
a
clergyman
and
it
affected
them
in
no
other
way
than
as
a
piece
of
news
to
spread
at
meryton
lady
lucas
could
not
be
insensible
of
triumph
on
being
able
to
retort
on
mrs
bennet
the
comfort
of
having
a
daughter
well
married
and
she
called
at
longbourn
rather
oftener
than
usual
to
say
how
happy
she
was
though
mrs
bennet
s
sour
looks
and
ill
natured
remarks
might
have
been
enough
to
drive
happiness
away
between
elizabeth
and
charlotte
there
was
a
restraint
which
kept
them
mutually
silent
on
the
subject
and
elizabeth
felt
persuaded
that
no
real
confidence
could
ever
subsist
between
them
again
her
disappointment
in
charlotte
made
her
turn
with
fonder
regard
to
her
sister
of
whose
rectitude
and
delicacy
she
was
sure
her
opinion
could
never
be
shaken
and
for
whose
happiness
she
grew
daily
more
anxious
as
bingley
had
now
been
gone
a
week
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
his
return
jane
had
sent
caroline
an
early
answer
to
her
letter
and
was
counting
the
days
till
she
might
reasonably
hope
to
hear
again
the
promised
letter
of
thanks
from
mr
collins
arrived
on
tuesday
addressed
to
their
father
and
written
with
all
the
solemnity
of
gratitude
which
a
twelvemonth
s
abode
in
the
family
might
have
prompted
after
discharging
his
conscience
on
that
head
he
proceeded
to
inform
them
with
many
rapturous
expressions
of
his
happiness
in
having
obtained
the
affection
of
their
amiable
neighbour
miss
lucas
and
then
explained
that
it
was
merely
with
the
view
of
enjoying
her
society
that
he
had
been
so
ready
to
close
with
their
kind
wish
of
seeing
him
again
at
longbourn
whither
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
return
on
monday
fortnight
for
lady
catherine
he
added
so
heartily
approved
his
marriage
that
she
wished
it
to
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
which
he
trusted
would
be
an
unanswerable
argument
with
his
amiable
charlotte
to
name
an
early
day
for
making
him
the
happiest
of
men
mr
collins
s
return
into
hertfordshire
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
pleasure
to
mrs
bennet
on
the
contrary
she
was
as
much
disposed
to
complain
of
it
as
her
husband
it
was
very
strange
that
he
should
come
to
longbourn
instead
of
to
lucas
lodge
it
was
also
very
inconvenient
and
exceedingly
troublesome
she
hated
having
visitors
in
the
house
while
her
health
was
so
indifferent
and
lovers
were
of
all
people
the
most
disagreeable
such
were
the
gentle
murmurs
of
mrs
bennet
and
they
gave
way
only
to
the
greater
distress
of
mr
bingley
s
continued
absence
neither
jane
nor
elizabeth
were
comfortable
on
this
subject
day
after
day
passed
away
without
bringing
any
other
tidings
of
him
than
the
report
which
shortly
prevailed
in
meryton
of
his
coming
no
more
to
netherfield
the
whole
winter
a
report
which
highly
incensed
mrs
bennet
and
which
she
never
failed
to
contradict
as
a
most
scandalous
falsehood
even
elizabeth
began
to
fear
not
that
bingley
was
indifferent
but
that
his
sisters
would
be
successful
in
keeping
him
away
unwilling
as
she
was
to
admit
an
idea
so
destructive
of
jane
s
happiness
and
so
