emma
woodhouse
handsome
clever
and
rich
with
a
comfortable
home
and
happy
disposition
seemed
to
unite
some
of
the
best
blessings
of
existence
and
had
lived
nearly
twenty
one
years
in
the
world
with
very
little
to
distress
or
vex
her
she
was
the
youngest
of
the
two
daughters
of
a
most
affectionate
indulgent
father
and
had
in
consequence
of
her
sister
s
marriage
been
mistress
of
his
house
from
a
very
early
period
her
mother
had
died
too
long
ago
for
her
to
have
more
than
an
indistinct
remembrance
of
her
caresses
and
her
place
had
been
supplied
by
an
excellent
woman
as
governess
who
had
fallen
little
short
of
a
mother
in
affection
sixteen
years
had
miss
taylor
been
in
mr
woodhouse
s
family
less
as
a
governess
than
a
friend
very
fond
of
both
daughters
but
particularly
of
emma
between
them
it
was
more
the
intimacy
of
sisters
even
before
miss
taylor
had
ceased
to
hold
the
nominal
office
of
governess
the
mildness
of
her
temper
had
hardly
allowed
her
to
impose
any
restraint
and
the
shadow
of
authority
being
now
long
passed
away
they
had
been
living
together
as
friend
and
friend
very
mutually
attached
and
emma
doing
just
what
she
liked
highly
esteeming
miss
taylor
s
judgment
but
directed
chiefly
by
her
own
the
real
evils
indeed
of
emma
s
situation
were
the
power
of
having
rather
too
much
her
own
way
and
a
disposition
to
think
a
little
too
well
of
herself
these
were
the
disadvantages
which
threatened
alloy
to
her
many
enjoyments
the
danger
however
was
at
present
so
unperceived
that
they
did
not
by
any
means
rank
as
misfortunes
with
her
sorrow
came
a
gentle
sorrow
but
not
at
all
in
the
shape
of
any
disagreeable
consciousness
miss
taylor
married
it
was
miss
taylor
s
loss
which
first
brought
grief
it
was
on
the
wedding
day
of
this
beloved
friend
that
emma
first
sat
in
mournful
thought
of
any
continuance
the
wedding
over
and
the
bride
people
gone
her
father
and
herself
were
left
to
dine
together
with
no
prospect
of
a
third
to
cheer
a
long
evening
her
father
composed
himself
to
sleep
after
dinner
as
usual
and
she
had
then
only
to
sit
and
think
of
what
she
had
lost
the
event
had
every
promise
of
happiness
for
her
friend
mr
weston
was
a
man
of
unexceptionable
character
easy
fortune
suitable
age
and
pleasant
manners
and
there
was
some
satisfaction
in
considering
with
what
self
denying
generous
friendship
she
had
always
wished
and
promoted
the
match
but
it
was
a
black
morning
s
work
for
her
the
want
of
miss
taylor
would
be
felt
every
hour
of
every
day
she
recalled
her
past
kindness
the
kindness
the
affection
of
sixteen
years
how
she
had
taught
and
how
she
had
played
with
her
from
five
years
old
how
she
had
devoted
all
her
powers
to
attach
and
amuse
her
in
health
and
how
nursed
her
through
the
various
illnesses
of
childhood
a
large
debt
of
gratitude
was
owing
here
but
the
intercourse
of
the
last
seven
years
the
equal
footing
and
perfect
unreserve
which
had
soon
followed
isabella
s
marriage
on
their
being
left
to
each
other
was
yet
a
dearer
tenderer
recollection
she
had
been
a
friend
and
companion
such
as
few
possessed
intelligent
well
informed
useful
gentle
knowing
all
the
ways
of
the
family
interested
in
all
its
concerns
and
peculiarly
interested
in
herself
in
every
pleasure
every
scheme
of
hers
one
to
whom
she
could
speak
every
thought
as
it
arose
and
who
had
such
an
affection
for
her
as
could
never
find
fault
how
was
she
to
bear
the
change
it
was
true
that
her
friend
was
going
only
half
a
mile
from
them
but
emma
was
aware
that
great
must
be
the
difference
between
a
mrs
weston
only
half
a
mile
from
them
and
a
miss
taylor
in
the
house
and
with
all
her
advantages
natural
and
domestic
she
was
now
in
great
danger
of
suffering
from
intellectual
solitude
she
dearly
loved
her
father
but
he
was
no
companion
for
her
he
could
not
meet
her
in
conversation
rational
or
playful
the
evil
of
the
actual
disparity
in
their
ages
and
mr
woodhouse
had
not
married
early
was
much
increased
by
his
constitution
and
habits
for
having
been
a
valetudinarian
all
his
life
without
activity
of
mind
or
body
he
was
a
much
older
man
in
ways
than
in
years
and
though
everywhere
beloved
for
the
friendliness
of
his
heart
and
his
amiable
temper
his
talents
could
not
have
recommended
him
at
any
time
her
sister
though
comparatively
but
little
removed
by
matrimony
being
settled
in
london
only
sixteen
miles
off
was
much
beyond
her
daily
reach
and
many
a
long
october
and
november
evening
must
be
struggled
through
at
hartfield
before
christmas
brought
the
next
visit
from
isabella
and
her
husband
and
their
little
children
to
fill
the
house
and
give
her
pleasant
society
again
highbury
the
large
and
populous
village
almost
amounting
to
a
town
to
which
hartfield
in
spite
of
its
separate
lawn
and
shrubberies
and
name
did
really
belong
afforded
her
no
equals
the
woodhouses
were
first
in
consequence
there
all
looked
up
to
them
she
had
many
acquaintance
in
the
place
for
her
father
was
universally
civil
but
not
one
among
them
who
could
be
accepted
in
lieu
of
miss
taylor
for
even
half
a
day
it
was
a
melancholy
change
and
emma
could
not
but
sigh
over
it
and
wish
for
impossible
things
till
her
father
awoke
and
made
it
necessary
to
be
cheerful
his
spirits
required
support
he
was
a
nervous
man
easily
depressed
fond
of
every
body
that
he
was
used
to
and
hating
to
part
with
them
hating
change
of
every
kind
matrimony
as
the
origin
of
change
was
always
disagreeable
and
he
was
by
no
means
yet
reconciled
to
his
own
daughter
s
marrying
nor
could
ever
speak
of
her
but
with
compassion
though
it
had
been
entirely
a
match
of
affection
when
he
was
now
obliged
to
part
with
miss
taylor
too
and
from
his
habits
of
gentle
selfishness
and
of
being
never
able
to
suppose
that
other
people
could
feel
differently
from
himself
he
was
very
much
disposed
to
think
miss
taylor
had
done
as
sad
a
thing
for
herself
as
for
them
and
would
have
been
a
great
deal
happier
if
she
had
spent
all
the
rest
of
her
life
at
hartfield
emma
smiled
and
chatted
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
to
keep
him
from
such
thoughts
but
when
tea
came
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
say
exactly
as
he
had
said
at
dinner
poor
miss
taylor
i
wish
she
were
here
again
what
a
pity
it
is
that
mr
weston
ever
thought
of
her
i
cannot
agree
with
you
papa
you
know
i
cannot
mr
weston
is
such
a
good
humoured
pleasant
excellent
man
that
he
thoroughly
deserves
a
good
wife
and
you
would
not
have
had
miss
taylor
live
with
us
for
ever
and
bear
all
my
odd
humours
when
she
might
have
a
house
of
her
own
a
house
of
her
own
but
where
is
the
advantage
of
a
house
of
her
own
this
is
three
times
as
large
and
you
have
never
any
odd
humours
my
dear
how
often
we
shall
be
going
to
see
them
and
they
coming
to
see
us
we
shall
be
always
meeting
we
must
begin
we
must
go
and
pay
wedding
visit
very
soon
my
dear
how
am
i
to
get
so
far
randalls
is
such
a
distance
i
could
not
walk
half
so
far
no
papa
nobody
thought
of
your
walking
we
must
go
in
the
carriage
to
be
sure
the
carriage
but
james
will
not
like
to
put
the
horses
to
for
such
a
little
way
and
where
are
the
poor
horses
to
be
while
we
are
paying
our
visit
they
are
to
be
put
into
mr
weston
s
stable
papa
you
know
we
have
settled
all
that
already
we
talked
it
all
over
with
mr
weston
last
night
and
as
for
james
you
may
be
very
sure
he
will
always
like
going
to
randalls
because
of
his
daughter
s
being
housemaid
there
i
only
doubt
whether
he
will
ever
take
us
anywhere
else
that
was
your
doing
papa
you
got
hannah
that
good
place
nobody
thought
of
hannah
till
you
mentioned
her
james
is
so
obliged
to
you
i
am
very
glad
i
did
think
of
her
it
was
very
lucky
for
i
would
not
have
had
poor
james
think
himself
slighted
upon
any
account
and
i
am
sure
she
will
make
a
very
good
servant
she
is
a
civil
pretty
spoken
girl
i
have
a
great
opinion
of
her
whenever
i
see
her
she
always
curtseys
and
asks
me
how
i
do
in
a
very
pretty
manner
and
when
you
have
had
her
here
to
do
needlework
i
observe
she
always
turns
the
lock
of
the
door
the
right
way
and
never
bangs
it
i
am
sure
she
will
be
an
excellent
servant
and
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
poor
miss
taylor
to
have
somebody
about
her
that
she
is
used
to
see
whenever
james
goes
over
to
see
his
daughter
you
know
she
will
be
hearing
of
us
he
will
be
able
to
tell
her
how
we
all
are
emma
spared
no
exertions
to
maintain
this
happier
flow
of
ideas
and
hoped
by
the
help
of
backgammon
to
get
her
father
tolerably
through
the
evening
and
be
attacked
by
no
regrets
but
her
own
the
backgammon
table
was
placed
but
a
visitor
immediately
afterwards
walked
in
and
made
it
unnecessary
mr
knightley
a
sensible
man
about
seven
or
eight
and
thirty
was
not
only
a
very
old
and
intimate
friend
of
the
family
but
particularly
connected
with
it
as
the
elder
brother
of
isabella
s
husband
he
lived
about
a
mile
from
highbury
was
a
frequent
visitor
and
always
welcome
and
at
this
time
more
welcome
than
usual
as
coming
directly
from
their
mutual
connexions
in
london
he
had
returned
to
a
late
dinner
after
some
days
absence
and
now
walked
up
to
hartfield
to
say
that
all
were
well
in
brunswick
square
it
was
a
happy
circumstance
and
animated
mr
woodhouse
for
some
time
mr
knightley
had
a
cheerful
manner
which
always
did
him
good
and
his
many
inquiries
after
poor
isabella
and
her
children
were
answered
most
satisfactorily
when
this
was
over
mr
woodhouse
gratefully
observed
it
is
very
kind
of
you
mr
knightley
to
come
out
at
this
late
hour
to
call
upon
us
i
am
afraid
you
must
have
had
a
shocking
walk
not
at
all
sir
it
is
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
so
mild
that
i
must
draw
back
from
your
great
fire
but
you
must
have
found
it
very
damp
and
dirty
i
wish
you
may
not
catch
cold
dirty
sir
look
at
my
shoes
not
a
speck
on
them
well
that
is
quite
surprising
for
we
have
had
a
vast
deal
of
rain
here
it
rained
dreadfully
hard
for
half
an
hour
while
we
were
at
breakfast
i
wanted
them
to
put
off
the
wedding
by
the
bye
i
have
not
wished
you
joy
being
pretty
well
aware
of
what
sort
of
joy
you
must
both
be
feeling
i
have
been
in
no
hurry
with
my
congratulations
but
i
hope
it
all
went
off
tolerably
well
how
did
you
all
behave
who
cried
most
ah
poor
miss
taylor
tis
a
sad
business
poor
mr
and
miss
woodhouse
if
you
please
but
i
cannot
possibly
say
poor
miss
taylor
i
have
a
great
regard
for
you
and
emma
but
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
dependence
or
independence
at
any
rate
it
must
be
better
to
have
only
one
to
please
than
two
especially
when
one
of
those
two
is
such
a
fanciful
troublesome
creature
said
emma
playfully
that
is
what
you
have
in
your
head
i
know
and
what
you
would
certainly
say
if
my
father
were
not
by
i
believe
it
is
very
true
my
dear
indeed
said
mr
woodhouse
with
a
sigh
i
am
afraid
i
am
sometimes
very
fanciful
and
troublesome
my
dearest
papa
you
do
not
think
i
could
mean
you
or
suppose
mr
knightley
to
mean
you
what
a
horrible
idea
oh
no
i
meant
only
myself
mr
knightley
loves
to
find
fault
with
me
you
know
in
a
joke
it
is
all
a
joke
we
always
say
what
we
like
to
one
another
mr
knightley
in
fact
was
one
of
the
few
people
who
could
see
faults
in
emma
woodhouse
and
the
only
one
who
ever
told
her
of
them
and
though
this
was
not
particularly
agreeable
to
emma
herself
she
knew
it
would
be
so
much
less
so
to
her
father
that
she
would
not
have
him
really
suspect
such
a
circumstance
as
her
not
being
thought
perfect
by
every
body
emma
knows
i
never
flatter
her
said
mr
knightley
but
i
meant
no
reflection
on
any
body
miss
taylor
has
been
used
to
have
two
persons
to
please
she
will
now
have
but
one
the
chances
are
that
she
must
be
a
gainer
well
said
emma
willing
to
let
it
pass
you
want
to
hear
about
the
wedding
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
tell
you
for
we
all
behaved
charmingly
every
body
was
punctual
every
body
in
their
best
looks
not
a
tear
and
hardly
a
long
face
to
be
seen
oh
no
we
all
felt
that
we
were
going
to
be
only
half
a
mile
apart
and
were
sure
of
meeting
every
day
dear
emma
bears
every
thing
so
well
said
her
father
but
mr
knightley
she
is
really
very
sorry
to
lose
poor
miss
taylor
and
i
am
sure
she
will
miss
her
more
than
she
thinks
for
emma
turned
away
her
head
divided
between
tears
and
smiles
it
is
impossible
that
emma
should
not
miss
such
a
companion
said
mr
knightley
we
should
not
like
her
so
well
as
we
do
sir
if
we
could
suppose
it
but
she
knows
how
much
the
marriage
is
to
miss
taylor
s
advantage
she
knows
how
very
acceptable
it
must
be
at
miss
taylor
s
time
of
life
to
be
settled
in
a
home
of
her
own
and
how
important
to
her
to
be
secure
of
a
comfortable
provision
and
therefore
cannot
allow
herself
to
feel
so
much
pain
as
pleasure
every
friend
of
miss
taylor
must
be
glad
to
have
her
so
happily
married
and
you
have
forgotten
one
matter
of
joy
to
me
said
emma
and
a
very
considerable
one
that
i
made
the
match
myself
i
made
the
match
you
know
four
years
ago
and
to
have
it
take
place
and
be
proved
in
the
right
when
so
many
people
said
mr
weston
would
never
marry
again
may
comfort
me
for
any
thing
mr
knightley
shook
his
head
at
her
her
father
fondly
replied
ah
my
dear
i
wish
you
would
not
make
matches
and
foretell
things
for
whatever
you
say
always
comes
to
pass
pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches
i
promise
you
to
make
none
for
myself
papa
but
i
must
indeed
for
other
people
it
is
the
greatest
amusement
in
the
world
and
after
such
success
you
know
every
body
said
that
mr
weston
would
never
marry
again
oh
dear
no
mr
weston
who
had
been
a
widower
so
long
and
who
seemed
so
perfectly
comfortable
without
a
wife
so
constantly
occupied
either
in
his
business
in
town
or
among
his
friends
here
always
acceptable
wherever
he
went
always
cheerful
mr
weston
need
not
spend
a
single
evening
in
the
year
alone
if
he
did
not
like
it
oh
no
mr
weston
certainly
would
never
marry
again
some
people
even
talked
of
a
promise
to
his
wife
on
her
deathbed
and
others
of
the
son
and
the
uncle
not
letting
him
all
manner
of
solemn
nonsense
was
talked
on
the
subject
but
i
believed
none
of
it
ever
since
the
day
about
four
years
ago
that
miss
taylor
and
i
met
with
him
in
broadway
lane
when
because
it
began
to
drizzle
he
darted
away
with
so
much
gallantry
and
borrowed
two
umbrellas
for
us
from
farmer
mitchell
s
i
made
up
my
mind
on
the
subject
i
planned
the
match
from
that
hour
and
when
such
success
has
blessed
me
in
this
instance
dear
papa
you
cannot
think
that
i
shall
leave
off
match
making
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
success
said
mr
knightley
success
supposes
endeavour
your
time
has
been
properly
and
delicately
spent
if
you
have
been
endeavouring
for
the
last
four
years
to
bring
about
this
marriage
a
worthy
employment
for
a
young
lady
s
mind
but
if
which
i
rather
imagine
your
making
the
match
as
you
call
it
means
only
your
planning
it
your
saying
to
yourself
one
idle
day
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
for
miss
taylor
if
mr
weston
were
to
marry
her
and
saying
it
again
to
yourself
every
now
and
then
afterwards
why
do
you
talk
of
success
where
is
your
merit
what
are
you
proud
of
you
made
a
lucky
guess
and
that
is
all
that
can
be
said
and
have
you
never
known
the
pleasure
and
triumph
of
a
lucky
guess
i
pity
you
i
thought
you
cleverer
for
depend
upon
it
a
lucky
guess
is
never
merely
luck
there
is
always
some
talent
in
it
and
as
to
my
poor
word
success
which
you
quarrel
with
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
so
entirely
without
any
claim
to
it
you
have
drawn
two
pretty
pictures
but
i
think
there
may
be
a
third
a
something
between
the
do
nothing
and
the
do
all
if
i
had
not
promoted
mr
weston
s
visits
here
and
given
many
little
encouragements
and
smoothed
many
little
matters
it
might
not
have
come
to
any
thing
after
all
i
think
you
must
know
hartfield
enough
to
comprehend
that
a
straightforward
open
hearted
man
like
weston
and
a
rational
unaffected
woman
like
miss
taylor
may
be
safely
left
to
manage
their
own
concerns
you
are
more
likely
to
have
done
harm
to
yourself
than
good
to
them
by
interference
emma
never
thinks
of
herself
if
she
can
do
good
to
others
rejoined
mr
woodhouse
understanding
but
in
part
but
my
dear
pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches
they
are
silly
things
and
break
up
one
s
family
circle
grievously
only
one
more
papa
only
for
mr
elton
poor
mr
elton
you
like
mr
elton
papa
i
must
look
about
for
a
wife
for
him
there
is
nobody
in
highbury
who
deserves
him
and
he
has
been
here
a
whole
year
and
has
fitted
up
his
house
so
comfortably
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
him
single
any
longer
and
i
thought
when
he
was
joining
their
hands
to
day
he
looked
so
very
much
as
if
he
would
like
to
have
the
same
kind
office
done
for
him
i
think
very
well
of
mr
elton
and
this
is
the
only
way
i
have
of
doing
him
a
service
mr
elton
is
a
very
pretty
young
man
to
be
sure
and
a
very
good
young
man
and
i
have
a
great
regard
for
him
but
if
you
want
to
shew
him
any
attention
my
dear
ask
him
to
come
and
dine
with
us
some
day
that
will
be
a
much
better
thing
i
dare
say
mr
knightley
will
be
so
kind
as
to
meet
him
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
sir
at
any
time
said
mr
knightley
laughing
and
i
agree
with
you
entirely
that
it
will
be
a
much
better
thing
invite
him
to
dinner
emma
and
help
him
to
the
best
of
the
fish
and
the
chicken
but
leave
him
to
chuse
his
own
wife
depend
upon
it
a
man
of
six
or
seven
and
twenty
can
take
care
of
himself
chapter
ii
mr
weston
was
a
native
of
highbury
and
born
of
a
respectable
family
which
for
the
last
two
or
three
generations
had
been
rising
into
gentility
and
property
he
had
received
a
good
education
but
on
succeeding
early
in
life
to
a
small
independence
had
become
indisposed
for
any
of
the
more
homely
pursuits
in
which
his
brothers
were
engaged
and
had
satisfied
an
active
cheerful
mind
and
social
temper
by
entering
into
the
militia
of
his
county
then
embodied
captain
weston
was
a
general
favourite
and
when
the
chances
of
his
military
life
had
introduced
him
to
miss
churchill
of
a
great
yorkshire
family
and
miss
churchill
fell
in
love
with
him
nobody
was
surprized
except
her
brother
and
his
wife
who
had
never
seen
him
and
who
were
full
of
pride
and
importance
which
the
connexion
would
offend
miss
churchill
however
being
of
age
and
with
the
full
command
of
her
fortune
though
her
fortune
bore
no
proportion
to
the
family
estate
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
the
marriage
and
it
took
place
to
the
infinite
mortification
of
mr
and
mrs
churchill
who
threw
her
off
with
due
decorum
it
was
an
unsuitable
connexion
and
did
not
produce
much
happiness
mrs
weston
ought
to
have
found
more
in
it
for
she
had
a
husband
whose
warm
heart
and
sweet
temper
made
him
think
every
thing
due
to
her
in
return
for
the
great
goodness
of
being
in
love
with
him
but
though
she
had
one
sort
of
spirit
she
had
not
the
best
she
had
resolution
enough
to
pursue
her
own
will
in
spite
of
her
brother
but
not
enough
to
refrain
from
unreasonable
regrets
at
that
brother
s
unreasonable
anger
nor
from
missing
the
luxuries
of
her
former
home
they
lived
beyond
their
income
but
still
it
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
enscombe
she
did
not
cease
to
love
her
husband
but
she
wanted
at
once
to
be
the
wife
of
captain
weston
and
miss
churchill
of
enscombe
captain
weston
who
had
been
considered
especially
by
the
churchills
as
making
such
an
amazing
match
was
proved
to
have
much
the
worst
of
the
bargain
for
when
his
wife
died
after
a
three
years
marriage
he
was
rather
a
poorer
man
than
at
first
and
with
a
child
to
maintain
from
the
expense
of
the
child
however
he
was
soon
relieved
the
boy
had
with
the
additional
softening
claim
of
a
lingering
illness
of
his
mother
s
been
the
means
of
a
sort
of
reconciliation
and
mr
and
mrs
churchill
having
no
children
of
their
own
nor
any
other
young
creature
of
equal
kindred
to
care
for
offered
to
take
the
whole
charge
of
the
little
frank
soon
after
her
decease
some
scruples
and
some
reluctance
the
widower
father
may
be
supposed
to
have
felt
but
as
they
were
overcome
by
other
considerations
the
child
was
given
up
to
the
care
and
the
wealth
of
the
churchills
and
he
had
only
his
own
comfort
to
seek
and
his
own
situation
to
improve
as
he
could
a
complete
change
of
life
became
desirable
he
quitted
the
militia
and
engaged
in
trade
having
brothers
already
established
in
a
good
way
in
london
which
afforded
him
a
favourable
opening
it
was
a
concern
which
brought
just
employment
enough
he
had
still
a
small
house
in
highbury
where
most
of
his
leisure
days
were
spent
and
between
useful
occupation
and
the
pleasures
of
society
the
next
eighteen
or
twenty
years
of
his
life
passed
cheerfully
away
he
had
by
that
time
realised
an
easy
competence
enough
to
secure
the
purchase
of
a
little
estate
adjoining
highbury
which
he
had
always
longed
for
enough
to
marry
a
woman
as
portionless
even
as
miss
taylor
and
to
live
according
to
the
wishes
of
his
own
friendly
and
social
disposition
it
was
now
some
time
since
miss
taylor
had
begun
to
influence
his
schemes
but
as
it
was
not
the
tyrannic
influence
of
youth
on
youth
it
had
not
shaken
his
determination
of
never
settling
till
he
could
purchase
randalls
and
the
sale
of
randalls
was
long
looked
forward
to
but
he
had
gone
steadily
on
with
these
objects
in
view
till
they
were
accomplished
he
had
made
his
fortune
bought
his
house
and
obtained
his
wife
and
was
beginning
a
new
period
of
existence
with
every
probability
of
greater
happiness
than
in
any
yet
passed
through
he
had
never
been
an
unhappy
man
his
own
temper
had
secured
him
from
that
even
in
his
first
marriage
but
his
second
must
shew
him
how
delightful
a
well
judging
and
truly
amiable
woman
could
be
and
must
give
him
the
pleasantest
proof
of
its
being
a
great
deal
better
to
choose
than
to
be
chosen
to
excite
gratitude
than
to
feel
it
he
had
only
himself
to
please
in
his
choice
his
fortune
was
his
own
for
as
to
frank
it
was
more
than
being
tacitly
brought
up
as
his
uncle
s
heir
it
had
become
so
avowed
an
adoption
as
to
have
him
assume
the
name
of
churchill
on
coming
of
age
it
was
most
unlikely
therefore
that
he
should
ever
want
his
father
s
assistance
his
father
had
no
apprehension
of
it
the
aunt
was
a
capricious
woman
and
governed
her
husband
entirely
but
it
was
not
in
mr
weston
s
nature
to
imagine
that
any
caprice
could
be
strong
enough
to
affect
one
so
dear
and
as
he
believed
so
deservedly
dear
he
saw
his
son
every
year
in
london
and
was
proud
of
him
and
his
fond
report
of
him
as
a
very
fine
young
man
had
made
highbury
feel
a
sort
of
pride
in
him
too
he
was
looked
on
as
sufficiently
belonging
to
the
place
to
make
his
merits
and
prospects
a
kind
of
common
concern
mr
frank
churchill
was
one
of
the
boasts
of
highbury
and
a
lively
curiosity
to
see
him
prevailed
though
the
compliment
was
so
little
returned
that
he
had
never
been
there
in
his
life
his
coming
to
visit
his
father
had
been
often
talked
of
but
never
achieved
now
upon
his
father
s
marriage
it
was
very
generally
proposed
as
a
most
proper
attention
that
the
visit
should
take
place
there
was
not
a
dissentient
voice
on
the
subject
either
when
mrs
perry
drank
tea
with
mrs
and
miss
bates
or
when
mrs
and
miss
bates
returned
the
visit
now
was
the
time
for
mr
frank
churchill
to
come
among
them
and
the
hope
strengthened
when
it
was
understood
that
he
had
written
to
his
new
mother
on
the
occasion
for
a
few
days
every
morning
visit
in
highbury
included
some
mention
of
the
handsome
letter
mrs
weston
had
received
i
suppose
you
have
heard
of
the
handsome
letter
mr
frank
churchill
has
written
to
mrs
weston
i
understand
it
was
a
very
handsome
letter
indeed
mr
woodhouse
told
me
of
it
mr
woodhouse
saw
the
letter
and
he
says
he
never
saw
such
a
handsome
letter
in
his
life
it
was
indeed
a
highly
prized
letter
mrs
weston
had
of
course
formed
a
very
favourable
idea
of
the
young
man
and
such
a
pleasing
attention
was
an
irresistible
proof
of
his
great
good
sense
and
a
most
welcome
addition
to
every
source
and
every
expression
of
congratulation
which
her
marriage
had
already
secured
she
felt
herself
a
most
fortunate
woman
and
she
had
lived
long
enough
to
know
how
fortunate
she
might
well
be
thought
where
the
only
regret
was
for
a
partial
separation
from
friends
whose
friendship
for
her
had
never
cooled
and
who
could
ill
bear
to
part
with
her
she
knew
that
at
times
she
must
be
missed
and
could
not
think
without
pain
of
emma
s
losing
a
single
pleasure
or
suffering
an
hour
s
ennui
from
the
want
of
her
companionableness
but
dear
emma
was
of
no
feeble
character
she
was
more
equal
to
her
situation
than
most
girls
would
have
been
and
had
sense
and
energy
and
spirits
that
might
be
hoped
would
bear
her
well
and
happily
through
its
little
difficulties
and
privations
and
then
there
was
such
comfort
in
the
very
easy
distance
of
randalls
from
hartfield
so
convenient
for
even
solitary
female
walking
and
in
mr
weston
s
disposition
and
circumstances
which
would
make
the
approaching
season
no
hindrance
to
their
spending
half
the
evenings
in
the
week
together
her
situation
was
altogether
the
subject
of
hours
of
gratitude
to
mrs
weston
and
of
moments
only
of
regret
and
her
satisfaction
her
more
than
satisfaction
her
cheerful
enjoyment
was
so
just
and
so
apparent
that
emma
well
as
she
knew
her
father
was
sometimes
taken
by
surprize
at
his
being
still
able
to
pity
poor
miss
taylor
when
they
left
her
at
randalls
in
the
centre
of
every
domestic
comfort
or
saw
her
go
away
in
the
evening
attended
by
her
pleasant
husband
to
a
carriage
of
her
own
but
never
did
she
go
without
mr
woodhouse
s
giving
a
gentle
sigh
and
saying
ah
poor
miss
taylor
she
would
be
very
glad
to
stay
there
was
no
recovering
miss
taylor
nor
much
likelihood
of
ceasing
to
pity
her
but
a
few
weeks
brought
some
alleviation
to
mr
woodhouse
the
compliments
of
his
neighbours
were
over
he
was
no
longer
teased
by
being
wished
joy
of
so
sorrowful
an
event
and
the
wedding
cake
which
had
been
a
great
distress
to
him
was
all
eat
up
his
own
stomach
could
bear
nothing
rich
and
he
could
never
believe
other
people
to
be
different
from
himself
what
was
unwholesome
to
him
he
regarded
as
unfit
for
any
body
and
he
had
therefore
earnestly
tried
to
dissuade
them
from
having
any
wedding
cake
at
all
and
when
that
proved
vain
as
earnestly
tried
to
prevent
any
body
s
eating
it
he
had
been
at
the
pains
of
consulting
mr
perry
the
apothecary
on
the
subject
mr
perry
was
an
intelligent
gentlemanlike
man
whose
frequent
visits
were
one
of
the
comforts
of
mr
woodhouse
s
life
and
upon
being
applied
to
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
though
it
seemed
rather
against
the
bias
of
inclination
that
wedding
cake
might
certainly
disagree
with
many
perhaps
with
most
people
unless
taken
moderately
with
such
an
opinion
in
confirmation
of
his
own
mr
woodhouse
hoped
to
influence
every
visitor
of
the
newly
married
pair
but
still
the
cake
was
eaten
and
there
was
no
rest
for
his
benevolent
nerves
till
it
was
all
gone
there
was
a
strange
rumour
in
highbury
of
all
the
little
perrys
being
seen
with
a
slice
of
mrs
weston
s
wedding
cake
in
their
hands
but
mr
woodhouse
would
never
believe
it
chapter
iii
mr
woodhouse
was
fond
of
society
in
his
own
way
he
liked
very
much
to
have
his
friends
come
and
see
him
and
from
various
united
causes
from
his
long
residence
at
hartfield
and
his
good
nature
from
his
fortune
his
house
and
his
daughter
he
could
command
the
visits
of
his
own
little
circle
in
a
great
measure
as
he
liked
he
had
not
much
intercourse
with
any
families
beyond
that
circle
his
horror
of
late
hours
and
large
dinner
parties
made
him
unfit
for
any
acquaintance
but
such
as
would
visit
him
on
his
own
terms
fortunately
for
him
highbury
including
randalls
in
the
same
parish
and
donwell
abbey
in
the
parish
adjoining
the
seat
of
mr
knightley
comprehended
many
such
not
unfrequently
through
emma
s
persuasion
he
had
some
of
the
chosen
and
the
best
to
dine
with
him
but
evening
parties
were
what
he
preferred
and
unless
he
fancied
himself
at
any
time
unequal
to
company
there
was
scarcely
an
evening
in
the
week
in
which
emma
could
not
make
up
a
card
table
for
him
real
long
standing
regard
brought
the
westons
and
mr
knightley
and
by
mr
elton
a
young
man
living
alone
without
liking
it
the
privilege
of
exchanging
any
vacant
evening
of
his
own
blank
solitude
for
the
elegancies
and
society
of
mr
woodhouse
s
drawing
room
and
the
smiles
of
his
lovely
daughter
was
in
no
danger
of
being
thrown
away
after
these
came
a
second
set
among
the
most
come
at
able
of
whom
were
mrs
and
miss
bates
and
mrs
goddard
three
ladies
almost
always
at
the
service
of
an
invitation
from
hartfield
and
who
were
fetched
and
carried
home
so
often
that
mr
woodhouse
thought
it
no
hardship
for
either
james
or
the
horses
had
it
taken
place
only
once
a
year
it
would
have
been
a
grievance
mrs
bates
the
widow
of
a
former
vicar
of
highbury
was
a
very
old
lady
almost
past
every
thing
but
tea
and
quadrille
she
lived
with
her
single
daughter
in
a
very
small
way
and
was
considered
with
all
the
regard
and
respect
which
a
harmless
old
lady
under
such
untoward
circumstances
can
excite
her
daughter
enjoyed
a
most
uncommon
degree
of
popularity
for
a
woman
neither
young
handsome
rich
nor
married
miss
bates
stood
in
the
very
worst
predicament
in
the
world
for
having
much
of
the
public
favour
and
she
had
no
intellectual
superiority
to
make
atonement
to
herself
or
frighten
those
who
might
hate
her
into
outward
respect
she
had
never
boasted
either
beauty
or
cleverness
her
youth
had
passed
without
distinction
and
her
middle
of
life
was
devoted
to
the
care
of
a
failing
mother
and
the
endeavour
to
make
a
small
income
go
as
far
as
possible
and
yet
she
was
a
happy
woman
and
a
woman
whom
no
one
named
without
good
will
it
was
her
own
universal
good
will
and
contented
temper
which
worked
such
wonders
she
loved
every
body
was
interested
in
every
body
s
happiness
quicksighted
to
every
body
s
merits
thought
herself
a
most
fortunate
creature
and
surrounded
with
blessings
in
such
an
excellent
mother
and
so
many
good
neighbours
and
friends
and
a
home
that
wanted
for
nothing
the
simplicity
and
cheerfulness
of
her
nature
her
contented
and
grateful
spirit
were
a
recommendation
to
every
body
and
a
mine
of
felicity
to
herself
she
was
a
great
talker
upon
little
matters
which
exactly
suited
mr
woodhouse
full
of
trivial
communications
and
harmless
gossip
mrs
goddard
was
the
mistress
of
a
school
not
of
a
seminary
or
an
establishment
or
any
thing
which
professed
in
long
sentences
of
refined
nonsense
to
combine
liberal
acquirements
with
elegant
morality
upon
new
principles
and
new
systems
and
where
young
ladies
for
enormous
pay
might
be
screwed
out
of
health
and
into
vanity
but
a
real
honest
old
fashioned
boarding
school
where
a
reasonable
quantity
of
accomplishments
were
sold
at
a
reasonable
price
and
where
girls
might
be
sent
to
be
out
of
the
way
and
scramble
themselves
into
a
little
education
without
any
danger
of
coming
back
prodigies
mrs
goddard
s
school
was
in
high
repute
and
very
deservedly
for
highbury
was
reckoned
a
particularly
healthy
spot
she
had
an
ample
house
and
garden
gave
the
children
plenty
of
wholesome
food
let
them
run
about
a
great
deal
in
the
summer
and
in
winter
dressed
their
chilblains
with
her
own
hands
it
was
no
wonder
that
a
train
of
twenty
young
couple
now
walked
after
her
to
church
she
was
a
plain
motherly
kind
of
woman
who
had
worked
hard
in
her
youth
and
now
thought
herself
entitled
to
the
occasional
holiday
of
a
tea
visit
and
having
formerly
owed
much
to
mr
woodhouse
s
kindness
felt
his
particular
claim
on
her
to
leave
her
neat
parlour
hung
round
with
fancy
work
whenever
she
could
and
win
or
lose
a
few
sixpences
by
his
fireside
these
were
the
ladies
whom
emma
found
herself
very
frequently
able
to
collect
and
happy
was
she
for
her
father
s
sake
in
the
power
though
as
far
as
she
was
herself
concerned
it
was
no
remedy
for
the
absence
of
mrs
weston
she
was
delighted
to
see
her
father
look
comfortable
and
very
much
pleased
with
herself
for
contriving
things
so
well
but
the
quiet
prosings
of
three
such
women
made
her
feel
that
every
evening
so
spent
was
indeed
one
of
the
long
evenings
she
had
fearfully
anticipated
as
she
sat
one
morning
looking
forward
to
exactly
such
a
close
of
the
present
day
a
note
was
brought
from
mrs
goddard
requesting
in
most
respectful
terms
to
be
allowed
to
bring
miss
smith
with
her
a
most
welcome
request
for
miss
smith
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
whom
emma
knew
very
well
by
sight
and
had
long
felt
an
interest
in
on
account
of
her
beauty
a
very
gracious
invitation
was
returned
and
the
evening
no
longer
dreaded
by
the
fair
mistress
of
the
mansion
harriet
smith
was
the
natural
daughter
of
somebody
somebody
had
placed
her
several
years
back
at
mrs
goddard
s
school
and
somebody
had
lately
raised
her
from
the
condition
of
scholar
to
that
of
parlour
boarder
this
was
all
that
was
generally
known
of
her
history
she
had
no
visible
friends
but
what
had
been
acquired
at
highbury
and
was
now
just
returned
from
a
long
visit
in
the
country
to
some
young
ladies
who
had
been
at
school
there
with
her
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
and
her
beauty
happened
to
be
of
a
sort
which
emma
particularly
admired
she
was
short
plump
and
fair
with
a
fine
bloom
blue
eyes
light
hair
regular
features
and
a
look
of
great
sweetness
and
before
the
end
of
the
evening
emma
was
as
much
pleased
with
her
manners
as
her
person
and
quite
determined
to
continue
the
acquaintance
she
was
not
struck
by
any
thing
remarkably
clever
in
miss
smith
s
conversation
but
she
found
her
altogether
very
engaging
not
inconveniently
shy
not
unwilling
to
talk
and
yet
so
far
from
pushing
shewing
so
proper
and
becoming
a
deference
seeming
so
pleasantly
grateful
for
being
admitted
to
hartfield
and
so
artlessly
impressed
by
the
appearance
of
every
thing
in
so
superior
a
style
to
what
she
had
been
used
to
that
she
must
have
good
sense
and
deserve
encouragement
encouragement
should
be
given
those
soft
blue
eyes
and
all
those
natural
graces
should
not
be
wasted
on
the
inferior
society
of
highbury
and
its
connexions
the
acquaintance
she
had
already
formed
were
unworthy
of
her
the
friends
from
whom
she
had
just
parted
though
very
good
sort
of
people
must
be
doing
her
harm
they
were
a
family
of
the
name
of
martin
whom
emma
well
knew
by
character
as
renting
a
large
farm
of
mr
knightley
and
residing
in
the
parish
of
donwell
very
creditably
she
believed
she
knew
mr
knightley
thought
highly
of
them
but
they
must
be
coarse
and
unpolished
and
very
unfit
to
be
the
intimates
of
a
girl
who
wanted
only
a
little
more
knowledge
and
elegance
to
be
quite
perfect
she
would
notice
her
she
would
improve
her
she
would
detach
her
from
her
bad
acquaintance
and
introduce
her
into
good
society
she
would
form
her
opinions
and
her
manners
it
would
be
an
interesting
and
certainly
a
very
kind
undertaking
highly
becoming
her
own
situation
in
life
her
leisure
and
powers
she
was
so
busy
in
admiring
those
soft
blue
eyes
in
talking
and
listening
and
forming
all
these
schemes
in
the
in
betweens
that
the
evening
flew
away
at
a
very
unusual
rate
and
the
supper
table
which
always
closed
such
parties
and
for
which
she
had
been
used
to
sit
and
watch
the
due
time
was
all
set
out
and
ready
and
moved
forwards
to
the
fire
before
she
was
aware
with
an
alacrity
beyond
the
common
impulse
of
a
spirit
which
yet
was
never
indifferent
to
the
credit
of
doing
every
thing
well
and
attentively
with
the
real
good
will
of
a
mind
delighted
with
its
own
ideas
did
she
then
do
all
the
honours
of
the
meal
and
help
and
recommend
the
minced
chicken
and
scalloped
oysters
with
an
urgency
which
she
knew
would
be
acceptable
to
the
early
hours
and
civil
scruples
of
their
guests
upon
such
occasions
poor
mr
woodhouses
feelings
were
in
sad
warfare
he
loved
to
have
the
cloth
laid
because
it
had
been
the
fashion
of
his
youth
but
his
conviction
of
suppers
being
very
unwholesome
made
him
rather
sorry
to
see
any
thing
put
on
it
and
while
his
hospitality
would
have
welcomed
his
visitors
to
every
thing
his
care
for
their
health
made
him
grieve
that
they
would
eat
such
another
small
basin
of
thin
gruel
as
his
own
was
all
that
he
could
with
thorough
self
approbation
recommend
though
he
might
constrain
himself
while
the
ladies
were
comfortably
clearing
the
nicer
things
to
say
mrs
bates
let
me
propose
your
venturing
on
one
of
these
eggs
an
egg
boiled
very
soft
is
not
unwholesome
serle
understands
boiling
an
egg
better
than
any
body
i
would
not
recommend
an
egg
boiled
by
any
body
else
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
they
are
very
small
you
see
one
of
our
small
eggs
will
not
hurt
you
miss
bates
let
emma
help
you
to
a
little
bit
of
tart
a
very
little
bit
ours
are
all
apple
tarts
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
unwholesome
preserves
here
i
do
not
advise
the
custard
mrs
goddard
what
say
you
to
half
a
glass
of
wine
a
small
half
glass
put
into
a
tumbler
of
water
i
do
not
think
it
could
disagree
with
you
emma
allowed
her
father
to
talk
but
supplied
her
visitors
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
style
and
on
the
present
evening
had
particular
pleasure
in
sending
them
away
happy
the
happiness
of
miss
smith
was
quite
equal
to
her
intentions
miss
woodhouse
was
so
great
a
personage
in
highbury
that
the
prospect
of
the
introduction
had
given
as
much
panic
as
pleasure
but
the
humble
grateful
little
girl
went
off
with
highly
gratified
feelings
delighted
with
the
affability
with
which
miss
woodhouse
had
treated
her
all
the
evening
and
actually
shaken
hands
with
her
at
last
chapter
iv
harriet
smith
s
intimacy
at
hartfield
was
soon
a
settled
thing
quick
and
decided
in
her
ways
emma
lost
no
time
in
inviting
encouraging
and
telling
her
to
come
very
often
and
as
their
acquaintance
increased
so
did
their
satisfaction
in
each
other
as
a
walking
companion
emma
had
very
early
foreseen
how
useful
she
might
find
her
in
that
respect
mrs
weston
s
loss
had
been
important
her
father
never
went
beyond
the
shrubbery
where
two
divisions
of
the
ground
sufficed
him
for
his
long
walk
or
his
short
as
the
year
varied
and
since
mrs
weston
s
marriage
her
exercise
had
been
too
much
confined
she
had
ventured
once
alone
to
randalls
but
it
was
not
pleasant
and
a
harriet
smith
therefore
one
whom
she
could
summon
at
any
time
to
a
walk
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
her
privileges
but
in
every
respect
as
she
saw
more
of
her
she
approved
her
and
was
confirmed
in
all
her
kind
designs
harriet
certainly
was
not
clever
but
she
had
a
sweet
docile
grateful
disposition
was
totally
free
from
conceit
and
only
desiring
to
be
guided
by
any
one
she
looked
up
to
her
early
attachment
to
herself
was
very
amiable
and
her
inclination
for
good
company
and
power
of
appreciating
what
was
elegant
and
clever
shewed
that
there
was
no
want
of
taste
though
strength
of
understanding
must
not
be
expected
altogether
she
was
quite
convinced
of
harriet
smith
s
being
exactly
the
young
friend
she
wanted
exactly
the
something
which
her
home
required
such
a
friend
as
mrs
weston
was
out
of
the
question
two
such
could
never
be
granted
two
such
she
did
not
want
it
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing
a
sentiment
distinct
and
independent
mrs
weston
was
the
object
of
a
regard
which
had
its
basis
in
gratitude
and
esteem
harriet
would
be
loved
as
one
to
whom
she
could
be
useful
for
mrs
weston
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
harriet
every
thing
her
first
attempts
at
usefulness
were
in
an
endeavour
to
find
out
who
were
the
parents
but
harriet
could
not
tell
she
was
ready
to
tell
every
thing
in
her
power
but
on
this
subject
questions
were
vain
emma
was
obliged
to
fancy
what
she
liked
but
she
could
never
believe
that
in
the
same
situation
she
should
not
have
discovered
the
truth
harriet
had
no
penetration
she
had
been
satisfied
to
hear
and
believe
just
what
mrs
goddard
chose
to
tell
her
and
looked
no
farther
mrs
goddard
and
the
teachers
and
the
girls
and
the
affairs
of
the
school
in
general
formed
naturally
a
great
part
of
the
conversation
and
but
for
her
acquaintance
with
the
martins
of
abbey
mill
farm
it
must
have
been
the
whole
but
the
martins
occupied
her
thoughts
a
good
deal
she
had
spent
two
very
happy
months
with
them
and
now
loved
to
talk
of
the
pleasures
of
her
visit
and
describe
the
many
comforts
and
wonders
of
the
place
emma
encouraged
her
talkativeness
amused
by
such
a
picture
of
another
set
of
beings
and
enjoying
the
youthful
simplicity
which
could
speak
with
so
much
exultation
of
mrs
martin
s
having
two
parlours
two
very
good
parlours
indeed
one
of
them
quite
as
large
as
mrs
goddard
s
drawing
room
and
of
her
having
an
upper
maid
who
had
lived
five
and
twenty
years
with
her
and
of
their
having
eight
cows
two
of
them
alderneys
and
one
a
little
welch
cow
a
very
pretty
little
welch
cow
indeed
and
of
mrs
martin
s
saying
as
she
was
so
fond
of
it
it
should
be
called
her
cow
and
of
their
having
a
very
handsome
summer
house
in
their
garden
where
some
day
next
year
they
were
all
to
drink
tea
a
very
handsome
summer
house
large
enough
to
hold
a
dozen
people
for
some
time
she
was
amused
without
thinking
beyond
the
immediate
cause
but
as
she
came
to
understand
the
family
better
other
feelings
arose
she
had
taken
up
a
wrong
idea
fancying
it
was
a
mother
and
daughter
a
son
and
son
s
wife
who
all
lived
together
but
when
it
appeared
that
the
mr
martin
who
bore
a
part
in
the
narrative
and
was
always
mentioned
with
approbation
for
his
great
good
nature
in
doing
something
or
other
was
a
single
man
that
there
was
no
young
mrs
martin
no
wife
in
the
case
she
did
suspect
danger
to
her
poor
little
friend
from
all
this
hospitality
and
kindness
and
that
if
she
were
not
taken
care
of
she
might
be
required
to
sink
herself
forever
with
this
inspiriting
notion
her
questions
increased
in
number
and
meaning
and
she
particularly
led
harriet
to
talk
more
of
mr
martin
and
there
was
evidently
no
dislike
to
it
harriet
was
very
ready
to
speak
of
the
share
he
had
had
in
their
moonlight
walks
and
merry
evening
games
and
dwelt
a
good
deal
upon
his
being
so
very
good
humoured
and
obliging
he
had
gone
three
miles
round
one
day
in
order
to
bring
her
some
walnuts
because
she
had
said
how
fond
she
was
of
them
and
in
every
thing
else
he
was
so
very
obliging
he
had
his
shepherd
s
son
into
the
parlour
one
night
on
purpose
to
sing
to
her
she
was
very
fond
of
singing
he
could
sing
a
little
himself
she
believed
he
was
very
clever
and
understood
every
thing
he
had
a
very
fine
flock
and
while
she
was
with
them
he
had
been
bid
more
for
his
wool
than
any
body
in
the
country
she
believed
every
body
spoke
well
of
him
his
mother
and
sisters
were
very
fond
of
him
mrs
martin
had
told
her
one
day
and
there
was
a
blush
as
she
said
it
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
body
to
be
a
better
son
and
therefore
she
was
sure
whenever
he
married
he
would
make
a
good
husband
not
that
she
wanted
him
to
marry
she
was
in
no
hurry
at
all
well
done
mrs
martin
thought
emma
you
know
what
you
are
about
and
when
she
had
come
away
mrs
martin
was
so
very
kind
as
to
send
mrs
goddard
a
beautiful
goose
the
finest
goose
mrs
goddard
had
ever
seen
mrs
goddard
had
dressed
it
on
a
sunday
and
asked
all
the
three
teachers
miss
nash
and
miss
prince
and
miss
richardson
to
sup
with
her
mr
martin
i
suppose
is
not
a
man
of
information
beyond
the
line
of
his
own
business
he
does
not
read
oh
yes
that
is
no
i
do
not
know
but
i
believe
he
has
read
a
good
deal
but
not
what
you
would
think
any
thing
of
he
reads
the
agricultural
reports
and
some
other
books
that
lay
in
one
of
the
window
seats
but
he
reads
all
them
to
himself
but
sometimes
of
an
evening
before
we
went
to
cards
he
would
read
something
aloud
out
of
the
elegant
extracts
very
entertaining
and
i
know
he
has
read
the
vicar
of
wakefield
he
never
read
the
romance
of
the
forest
nor
the
children
of
the
abbey
he
had
never
heard
of
such
books
before
i
mentioned
them
but
he
is
determined
to
get
them
now
as
soon
as
ever
he
can
the
next
question
was
what
sort
of
looking
man
is
mr
martin
oh
not
handsome
not
at
all
handsome
i
thought
him
very
plain
at
first
but
i
do
not
think
him
so
plain
now
one
does
not
you
know
after
a
time
but
did
you
never
see
him
he
is
in
highbury
every
now
and
then
and
he
is
sure
to
ride
through
every
week
in
his
way
to
kingston
he
has
passed
you
very
often
that
may
be
and
i
may
have
seen
him
fifty
times
but
without
having
any
idea
of
his
name
a
young
farmer
whether
on
horseback
or
on
foot
is
the
very
last
sort
of
person
to
raise
my
curiosity
the
yeomanry
are
precisely
the
order
of
people
with
whom
i
feel
i
can
have
nothing
to
do
a
degree
or
two
lower
and
a
creditable
appearance
might
interest
me
i
might
hope
to
be
useful
to
their
families
in
some
way
or
other
but
a
farmer
can
need
none
of
my
help
and
is
therefore
in
one
sense
as
much
above
my
notice
as
in
every
other
he
is
below
it
to
be
sure
oh
yes
it
is
not
likely
you
should
ever
have
observed
him
but
he
knows
you
very
well
indeed
i
mean
by
sight
i
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
very
respectable
young
man
i
know
indeed
that
he
is
so
and
as
such
wish
him
well
what
do
you
imagine
his
age
to
be
he
was
four
and
twenty
the
8th
of
last
june
and
my
birthday
is
the
23rd
just
a
fortnight
and
a
day
s
difference
which
is
very
odd
only
four
and
twenty
that
is
too
young
to
settle
his
mother
is
perfectly
right
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
they
seem
very
comfortable
as
they
are
and
if
she
were
to
take
any
pains
to
marry
him
she
would
probably
repent
it
six
years
hence
if
he
could
meet
with
a
good
sort
of
young
woman
in
the
same
rank
as
his
own
with
a
little
money
it
might
be
very
desirable
six
years
hence
dear
miss
woodhouse
he
would
be
thirty
years
old
well
and
that
is
as
early
as
most
men
can
afford
to
marry
who
are
not
born
to
an
independence
mr
martin
i
imagine
has
his
fortune
entirely
to
make
cannot
be
at
all
beforehand
with
the
world
whatever
money
he
might
come
into
when
his
father
died
whatever
his
share
of
the
family
property
it
is
i
dare
say
all
afloat
all
employed
in
his
stock
and
so
forth
and
though
with
diligence
and
good
luck
he
may
be
rich
in
time
it
is
next
to
impossible
that
he
should
have
realised
any
thing
yet
to
be
sure
so
it
is
but
they
live
very
comfortably
they
have
no
indoors
man
else
they
do
not
want
for
any
thing
and
mrs
martin
talks
of
taking
a
boy
another
year
i
wish
you
may
not
get
into
a
scrape
harriet
whenever
he
does
marry
i
mean
as
to
being
acquainted
with
his
wife
for
though
his
sisters
from
a
superior
education
are
not
to
be
altogether
objected
to
it
does
not
follow
that
he
might
marry
any
body
at
all
fit
for
you
to
notice
the
misfortune
of
your
birth
ought
to
make
you
particularly
careful
as
to
your
associates
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
your
being
a
gentleman
s
daughter
and
you
must
support
your
claim
to
that
station
by
every
thing
within
your
own
power
or
there
will
be
plenty
of
people
who
would
take
pleasure
in
degrading
you
yes
to
be
sure
i
suppose
there
are
but
while
i
visit
at
hartfield
and
you
are
so
kind
to
me
miss
woodhouse
i
am
not
afraid
of
what
any
body
can
do
you
understand
the
force
of
influence
pretty
well
harriet
but
i
would
have
you
so
firmly
established
in
good
society
as
to
be
independent
even
of
hartfield
and
miss
woodhouse
i
want
to
see
you
permanently
well
connected
and
to
that
end
it
will
be
advisable
to
have
as
few
odd
acquaintance
as
may
be
and
therefore
i
say
that
if
you
should
still
be
in
this
country
when
mr
martin
marries
i
wish
you
may
not
be
drawn
in
by
your
intimacy
with
the
sisters
to
be
acquainted
with
the
wife
who
will
probably
be
some
mere
farmer
s
daughter
without
education
to
be
sure
yes
not
that
i
think
mr
martin
would
ever
marry
any
body
but
what
had
had
some
education
and
been
very
well
brought
up
however
i
do
not
mean
to
set
up
my
opinion
against
yours
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
wish
for
the
acquaintance
of
his
wife
i
shall
always
have
a
great
regard
for
the
miss
martins
especially
elizabeth
and
should
be
very
sorry
to
give
them
up
for
they
are
quite
as
well
educated
as
me
but
if
he
marries
a
very
ignorant
vulgar
woman
certainly
i
had
better
not
visit
her
if
i
can
help
it
emma
watched
her
through
the
fluctuations
of
this
speech
and
saw
no
alarming
symptoms
of
love
the
young
man
had
been
the
first
admirer
but
she
trusted
there
was
no
other
hold
and
that
there
would
be
no
serious
difficulty
on
harriet
s
side
to
oppose
any
friendly
arrangement
of
her
own
they
met
mr
martin
the
very
next
day
as
they
were
walking
on
the
donwell
road
he
was
on
foot
and
after
looking
very
respectfully
at
her
looked
with
most
unfeigned
satisfaction
at
her
companion
emma
was
not
sorry
to
have
such
an
opportunity
of
survey
and
walking
a
few
yards
forward
while
they
talked
together
soon
made
her
quick
eye
sufficiently
acquainted
with
mr
robert
martin
his
appearance
was
very
neat
and
he
looked
like
a
sensible
young
man
but
his
person
had
no
other
advantage
and
when
he
came
to
be
contrasted
with
gentlemen
she
thought
he
must
lose
all
the
ground
he
had
gained
in
harriet
s
inclination
harriet
was
not
insensible
of
manner
she
had
voluntarily
noticed
her
father
s
gentleness
with
admiration
as
well
as
wonder
mr
martin
looked
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
manner
was
they
remained
but
a
few
minutes
together
as
miss
woodhouse
must
not
be
kept
waiting
and
harriet
then
came
running
to
her
with
a
smiling
face
and
in
a
flutter
of
spirits
which
miss
woodhouse
hoped
very
soon
to
compose
only
think
of
our
happening
to
meet
him
how
very
odd
it
was
quite
a
chance
he
said
that
he
had
not
gone
round
by
randalls
he
did
not
think
we
ever
walked
this
road
he
thought
we
walked
towards
randalls
most
days
he
has
not
been
able
to
get
the
romance
of
the
forest
yet
he
was
so
busy
the
last
time
he
was
at
kingston
that
he
quite
forgot
it
but
he
goes
again
to
morrow
so
very
odd
we
should
happen
to
meet
well
miss
woodhouse
is
he
like
what
you
expected
what
do
you
think
of
him
do
you
think
him
so
very
plain
he
is
very
plain
undoubtedly
remarkably
plain
but
that
is
nothing
compared
with
his
entire
want
of
gentility
i
had
no
right
to
expect
much
and
i
did
not
expect
much
but
i
had
no
idea
that
he
could
be
so
very
clownish
so
totally
without
air
i
had
imagined
him
i
confess
a
degree
or
two
nearer
gentility
to
be
sure
said
harriet
in
a
mortified
voice
he
is
not
so
genteel
as
real
gentlemen
i
think
harriet
since
your
acquaintance
with
us
you
have
been
repeatedly
in
the
company
of
some
such
very
real
gentlemen
that
you
must
yourself
be
struck
with
the
difference
in
mr
martin
at
hartfield
you
have
had
very
good
specimens
of
well
educated
well
bred
men
i
should
be
surprized
if
after
seeing
them
you
could
be
in
company
with
mr
martin
again
without
perceiving
him
to
be
a
very
inferior
creature
and
rather
wondering
at
yourself
for
having
ever
thought
him
at
all
agreeable
before
do
not
you
begin
to
feel
that
now
were
not
you
struck
i
am
sure
you
must
have
been
struck
by
his
awkward
look
and
abrupt
manner
and
the
uncouthness
of
a
voice
which
i
heard
to
be
wholly
unmodulated
as
i
stood
here
certainly
he
is
not
like
mr
knightley
he
has
not
such
a
fine
air
and
way
of
walking
as
mr
knightley
i
see
the
difference
plain
enough
but
mr
knightley
is
so
very
fine
a
man
mr
knightley
s
air
is
so
remarkably
good
that
it
is
not
fair
to
compare
mr
martin
with
him
you
might
not
see
one
in
a
hundred
with
gentleman
so
plainly
written
as
in
mr
knightley
but
he
is
not
the
only
gentleman
you
have
been
lately
used
to
what
say
you
to
mr
weston
and
mr
elton
compare
mr
martin
with
either
of
them
compare
their
manner
of
carrying
themselves
of
walking
of
speaking
of
being
silent
you
must
see
the
difference
oh
yes
there
is
a
great
difference
but
mr
weston
is
almost
an
old
man
mr
weston
must
be
between
forty
and
fifty
which
makes
his
good
manners
the
more
valuable
the
older
a
person
grows
harriet
the
more
important
it
is
that
their
manners
should
not
be
bad
the
more
glaring
and
disgusting
any
loudness
or
coarseness
or
awkwardness
becomes
what
is
passable
in
youth
is
detestable
in
later
age
mr
martin
is
now
awkward
and
abrupt
what
will
he
be
at
mr
weston
s
time
of
life
there
is
no
saying
indeed
replied
harriet
rather
solemnly
but
there
may
be
pretty
good
guessing
he
will
be
a
completely
gross
vulgar
farmer
totally
inattentive
to
appearances
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
profit
and
loss
will
he
indeed
that
will
be
very
bad
how
much
his
business
engrosses
him
already
is
very
plain
from
the
circumstance
of
his
forgetting
to
inquire
for
the
book
you
recommended
he
was
a
great
deal
too
full
of
the
market
to
think
of
any
thing
else
which
is
just
as
it
should
be
for
a
thriving
man
what
has
he
to
do
with
books
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
thrive
and
be
a
very
rich
man
in
time
and
his
being
illiterate
and
coarse
need
not
disturb
us
i
wonder
he
did
not
remember
the
book
was
all
harriet
s
answer
and
spoken
with
a
degree
of
grave
displeasure
which
emma
thought
might
be
safely
left
to
itself
she
therefore
said
no
more
for
some
time
her
next
beginning
was
in
one
respect
perhaps
mr
elton
s
manners
are
superior
to
mr
knightley
s
or
mr
weston
s
they
have
more
gentleness
they
might
be
more
safely
held
up
as
a
pattern
there
is
an
openness
a
quickness
almost
a
bluntness
in
mr
weston
which
every
body
likes
in
him
because
there
is
so
much
good
humour
with
it
but
that
would
not
do
to
be
copied
neither
would
mr
knightley
s
downright
decided
commanding
sort
of
manner
though
it
suits
him
very
well
his
figure
and
look
and
situation
in
life
seem
to
allow
it
but
if
any
young
man
were
to
set
about
copying
him
he
would
not
be
sufferable
on
the
contrary
i
think
a
young
man
might
be
very
safely
recommended
to
take
mr
elton
as
a
model
mr
elton
is
good
humoured
cheerful
obliging
and
gentle
he
seems
to
me
to
be
grown
particularly
gentle
of
late
i
do
not
know
whether
he
has
any
design
of
ingratiating
himself
with
either
of
us
harriet
by
additional
softness
but
it
strikes
me
that
his
manners
are
softer
than
they
used
to
be
if
he
means
any
thing
it
must
be
to
please
you
did
not
i
tell
you
what
he
said
of
you
the
other
day
she
then
repeated
some
warm
personal
praise
which
she
had
drawn
from
mr
elton
and
now
did
full
justice
to
and
harriet
blushed
and
smiled
and
said
she
had
always
thought
mr
elton
very
agreeable
mr
elton
was
the
very
person
fixed
on
by
emma
for
driving
the
young
farmer
out
of
harriet
s
head
she
thought
it
would
be
an
excellent
match
and
only
too
palpably
desirable
natural
and
probable
for
her
to
have
much
merit
in
planning
it
she
feared
it
was
what
every
body
else
must
think
of
and
predict
it
was
not
likely
however
that
any
body
should
have
equalled
her
in
the
date
of
the
plan
as
it
had
entered
her
brain
during
the
very
first
evening
of
harriet
s
coming
to
hartfield
the
longer
she
considered
it
the
greater
was
her
sense
of
its
expediency
mr
elton
s
situation
was
most
suitable
quite
the
gentleman
himself
and
without
low
connexions
at
the
same
time
not
of
any
family
that
could
fairly
object
to
the
doubtful
birth
of
harriet
he
had
a
comfortable
home
for
her
and
emma
imagined
a
very
sufficient
income
for
though
the
vicarage
of
highbury
was
not
large
he
was
known
to
have
some
independent
property
and
she
thought
very
highly
of
him
as
a
good
humoured
well
meaning
respectable
young
man
without
any
deficiency
of
useful
understanding
or
knowledge
of
the
world
she
had
already
satisfied
herself
that
he
thought
harriet
a
beautiful
girl
which
she
trusted
with
such
frequent
meetings
at
hartfield
was
foundation
enough
on
his
side
and
on
harriet
s
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
idea
of
being
preferred
by
him
would
have
all
the
usual
weight
and
efficacy
and
he
was
really
a
very
pleasing
young
man
a
young
man
whom
any
woman
not
fastidious
might
like
he
was
reckoned
very
handsome
his
person
much
admired
in
general
though
not
by
her
there
being
a
want
of
elegance
of
feature
which
she
could
not
dispense
with
but
the
girl
who
could
be
gratified
by
a
robert
martin
s
riding
about
the
country
to
get
walnuts
for
her
might
very
well
be
conquered
by
mr
elton
s
admiration
chapter
v
i
do
not
know
what
your
opinion
may
be
mrs
weston
said
mr
knightley
of
this
great
intimacy
between
emma
and
harriet
smith
but
i
think
it
a
bad
thing
a
bad
thing
do
you
really
think
it
a
bad
thing
why
so
i
think
they
will
neither
of
them
do
the
other
any
good
you
surprize
me
emma
must
do
harriet
good
and
by
supplying
her
with
a
new
object
of
interest
harriet
may
be
said
to
do
emma
good
i
have
been
seeing
their
intimacy
with
the
greatest
pleasure
how
very
differently
we
feel
not
think
they
will
do
each
other
any
good
this
will
certainly
be
the
beginning
of
one
of
our
quarrels
about
emma
mr
knightley
perhaps
you
think
i
am
come
on
purpose
to
quarrel
with
you
knowing
weston
to
be
out
and
that
you
must
still
fight
your
own
battle
mr
weston
would
undoubtedly
support
me
if
he
were
here
for
he
thinks
exactly
as
i
do
on
the
subject
we
were
speaking
of
it
only
yesterday
and
agreeing
how
fortunate
it
was
for
emma
that
there
should
be
such
a
girl
in
highbury
for
her
to
associate
with
mr
knightley
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
be
a
fair
judge
in
this
case
you
are
so
much
used
to
live
alone
that
you
do
not
know
the
value
of
a
companion
and
perhaps
no
man
can
be
a
good
judge
of
the
comfort
a
woman
feels
in
the
society
of
one
of
her
own
sex
after
being
used
to
it
all
her
life
i
can
imagine
your
objection
to
harriet
smith
she
is
not
the
superior
young
woman
which
emma
s
friend
ought
to
be
but
on
the
other
hand
as
emma
wants
to
see
her
better
informed
it
will
be
an
inducement
to
her
to
read
more
herself
they
will
read
together
she
means
it
i
know
emma
has
been
meaning
to
read
more
ever
since
she
was
twelve
years
old
i
have
seen
a
great
many
lists
of
her
drawing
up
at
various
times
of
books
that
she
meant
to
read
regularly
through
and
very
good
lists
they
were
very
well
chosen
and
very
neatly
arranged
sometimes
alphabetically
and
sometimes
by
some
other
rule
the
list
she
drew
up
when
only
fourteen
i
remember
thinking
it
did
her
judgment
so
much
credit
that
i
preserved
it
some
time
and
i
dare
say
she
may
have
made
out
a
very
good
list
now
but
i
have
done
with
expecting
any
course
of
steady
reading
from
emma
she
will
never
submit
to
any
thing
requiring
industry
and
patience
and
a
subjection
of
the
fancy
to
the
understanding
where
miss
taylor
failed
to
stimulate
i
may
safely
affirm
that
harriet
smith
will
do
nothing
you
never
could
persuade
her
to
read
half
so
much
as
you
wished
you
know
you
could
not
i
dare
say
replied
mrs
weston
smiling
that
i
thought
so
then
but
since
we
have
parted
i
can
never
remember
emma
s
omitting
to
do
any
thing
i
wished
there
is
hardly
any
desiring
to
refresh
such
a
memory
as
that
said
mr
knightley
feelingly
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
had
done
but
i
he
soon
added
who
have
had
no
such
charm
thrown
over
my
senses
must
still
see
hear
and
remember
emma
is
spoiled
by
being
the
cleverest
of
her
family
at
ten
years
old
she
had
the
misfortune
of
being
able
to
answer
questions
which
puzzled
her
sister
at
seventeen
she
was
always
quick
and
assured
isabella
slow
and
diffident
and
ever
since
she
was
twelve
emma
has
been
mistress
of
the
house
and
of
you
all
in
her
mother
she
lost
the
only
person
able
to
cope
with
her
she
inherits
her
mother
s
talents
and
must
have
been
under
subjection
to
her
i
should
have
been
sorry
mr
knightley
to
be
dependent
on
your
recommendation
had
i
quitted
mr
woodhouse
s
family
and
wanted
another
situation
i
do
not
think
you
would
have
spoken
a
good
word
for
me
to
any
body
i
am
sure
you
always
thought
me
unfit
for
the
office
i
held
yes
said
he
smiling
you
are
better
placed
here
very
fit
for
a
wife
but
not
at
all
for
a
governess
but
you
were
preparing
yourself
to
be
an
excellent
wife
all
the
time
you
were
at
hartfield
you
might
not
give
emma
such
a
complete
education
as
your
powers
would
seem
to
promise
but
you
were
receiving
a
very
good
education
from
her
on
the
very
material
matrimonial
point
of
submitting
your
own
will
and
doing
as
you
were
bid
and
if
weston
had
asked
me
to
recommend
him
a
wife
i
should
certainly
have
named
miss
taylor
thank
you
there
will
be
very
little
merit
in
making
a
good
wife
to
such
a
man
as
mr
weston
why
to
own
the
truth
i
am
afraid
you
are
rather
thrown
away
and
that
with
every
disposition
to
bear
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
borne
we
will
not
despair
however
weston
may
grow
cross
from
the
wantonness
of
comfort
or
his
son
may
plague
him
i
hope
not
that
it
is
not
likely
no
mr
knightley
do
not
foretell
vexation
from
that
quarter
not
i
indeed
i
only
name
possibilities
i
do
not
pretend
to
emma
s
genius
for
foretelling
and
guessing
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
the
young
man
may
be
a
weston
in
merit
and
a
churchill
in
fortune
but
harriet
smith
i
have
not
half
done
about
harriet
smith
i
think
her
the
very
worst
sort
of
companion
that
emma
could
possibly
have
she
knows
nothing
herself
and
looks
upon
emma
as
knowing
every
thing
she
is
a
flatterer
in
all
her
ways
and
so
much
the
worse
because
undesigned
her
ignorance
is
hourly
flattery
how
can
emma
imagine
she
has
any
thing
to
learn
herself
while
harriet
is
presenting
such
a
delightful
inferiority
and
as
for
harriet
i
will
venture
to
say
that
she
cannot
gain
by
the
acquaintance
hartfield
will
only
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
all
the
other
places
she
belongs
to
she
will
grow
just
refined
enough
to
be
uncomfortable
with
those
among
whom
birth
and
circumstances
have
placed
her
home
i
am
much
mistaken
if
emma
s
doctrines
give
any
strength
of
mind
or
tend
at
all
to
make
a
girl
adapt
herself
rationally
to
the
varieties
of
her
situation
in
life
they
only
give
a
little
polish
i
either
depend
more
upon
emma
s
good
sense
than
you
do
or
am
more
anxious
for
her
present
comfort
for
i
cannot
lament
the
acquaintance
how
well
she
looked
last
night
oh
you
would
rather
talk
of
her
person
than
her
mind
would
you
very
well
i
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
emma
s
being
pretty
pretty
say
beautiful
rather
can
you
imagine
any
thing
nearer
perfect
beauty
than
emma
altogether
face
and
figure
i
do
not
know
what
i
could
imagine
but
i
confess
that
i
have
seldom
seen
a
face
or
figure
more
pleasing
to
me
than
hers
but
i
am
a
partial
old
friend
such
an
eye
the
true
hazle
eye
and
so
brilliant
regular
features
open
countenance
with
a
complexion
oh
what
a
bloom
of
full
health
and
such
a
pretty
height
and
size
such
a
firm
and
upright
figure
there
is
health
not
merely
in
her
bloom
but
in
her
air
her
head
her
glance
one
hears
sometimes
of
a
child
being
the
picture
of
health
now
emma
always
gives
me
the
idea
of
being
the
complete
picture
of
grown
up
health
she
is
loveliness
itself
mr
knightley
is
not
she
i
have
not
a
fault
to
find
with
her
person
he
replied
i
think
her
all
you
describe
i
love
to
look
at
her
and
i
will
add
this
praise
that
i
do
not
think
her
personally
vain
considering
how
very
handsome
she
is
she
appears
to
be
little
occupied
with
it
her
vanity
lies
another
way
mrs
weston
i
am
not
to
be
talked
out
of
my
dislike
of
harriet
smith
or
my
dread
of
its
doing
them
both
harm
and
i
mr
knightley
am
equally
stout
in
my
confidence
of
its
not
doing
them
any
harm
with
all
dear
emma
s
little
faults
she
is
an
excellent
creature
where
shall
we
see
a
better
daughter
or
a
kinder
sister
or
a
truer
friend
no
no
she
has
qualities
which
may
be
trusted
she
will
never
lead
any
one
really
wrong
she
will
make
no
lasting
blunder
where
emma
errs
once
she
is
in
the
right
a
hundred
times
very
well
i
will
not
plague
you
any
more
emma
shall
be
an
angel
and
i
will
keep
my
spleen
to
myself
till
christmas
brings
john
and
isabella
john
loves
emma
with
a
reasonable
and
therefore
not
a
blind
affection
and
isabella
always
thinks
as
he
does
except
when
he
is
not
quite
frightened
enough
about
the
children
i
am
sure
of
having
their
opinions
with
me
i
know
that
you
all
love
her
really
too
well
to
be
unjust
or
unkind
but
excuse
me
mr
knightley
if
i
take
the
liberty
i
consider
myself
you
know
as
having
somewhat
of
the
privilege
of
speech
that
emma
s
mother
might
have
had
the
liberty
of
hinting
that
i
do
not
think
any
possible
good
can
arise
from
harriet
smith
s
intimacy
being
made
a
matter
of
much
discussion
among
you
pray
excuse
me
but
supposing
any
little
inconvenience
may
be
apprehended
from
the
intimacy
it
cannot
be
expected
that
emma
accountable
to
nobody
but
her
father
who
perfectly
approves
the
acquaintance
should
put
an
end
to
it
so
long
as
it
is
a
source
of
pleasure
to
herself
it
has
been
so
many
years
my
province
to
give
advice
that
you
cannot
be
surprized
mr
knightley
at
this
little
remains
of
office
not
at
all
cried
he
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
it
it
is
very
good
advice
and
it
shall
have
a
better
fate
than
your
advice
has
often
found
for
it
shall
be
attended
to
mrs
john
knightley
is
easily
alarmed
and
might
be
made
unhappy
about
her
sister
be
satisfied
said
he
i
will
not
raise
any
outcry
i
will
keep
my
ill
humour
to
myself
i
have
a
very
sincere
interest
in
emma
isabella
does
not
seem
more
my
sister
has
never
excited
a
greater
interest
perhaps
hardly
so
great
there
is
an
anxiety
a
curiosity
in
what
one
feels
for
emma
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
her
so
do
i
said
mrs
weston
gently
very
much
she
always
declares
she
will
never
marry
which
of
course
means
just
nothing
at
all
but
i
have
no
idea
that
she
has
yet
ever
seen
a
man
she
cared
for
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
her
to
be
very
much
in
love
with
a
proper
object
i
should
like
to
see
emma
in
love
and
in
some
doubt
of
a
return
it
would
do
her
good
but
there
is
nobody
hereabouts
to
attach
her
and
she
goes
so
seldom
from
home
there
does
indeed
seem
as
little
to
tempt
her
to
break
her
resolution
at
present
said
mrs
weston
as
can
well
be
and
while
she
is
so
happy
at
hartfield
i
cannot
wish
her
to
be
forming
any
attachment
which
would
be
creating
such
difficulties
on
poor
mr
woodhouse
s
account
i
do
not
recommend
matrimony
at
present
to
emma
though
i
mean
no
slight
to
the
state
i
assure
you
part
of
her
meaning
was
to
conceal
some
favourite
thoughts
of
her
own
and
mr
weston
s
on
the
subject
as
much
as
possible
there
were
wishes
at
randalls
respecting
emma
s
destiny
but
it
was
not
desirable
to
have
them
suspected
and
the
quiet
transition
which
mr
knightley
soon
afterwards
made
to
what
does
weston
think
of
the
weather
shall
we
have
rain
convinced
her
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
or
surmise
about
hartfield
chapter
vi
emma
could
not
feel
a
doubt
of
having
given
harriet
s
fancy
a
proper
direction
and
raised
the
gratitude
of
her
young
vanity
to
a
very
good
purpose
for
she
found
her
decidedly
more
sensible
than
before
of
mr
elton
s
being
a
remarkably
handsome
man
with
most
agreeable
manners
and
as
she
had
no
hesitation
in
following
up
the
assurance
of
his
admiration
by
agreeable
hints
she
was
soon
pretty
confident
of
creating
as
much
liking
on
harriet
s
side
as
there
could
be
any
occasion
for
she
was
quite
convinced
of
mr
elton
s
being
in
the
fairest
way
of
falling
in
love
if
not
in
love
already
she
had
no
scruple
with
regard
to
him
he
talked
of
harriet
and
praised
her
so
warmly
that
she
could
not
suppose
any
thing
wanting
which
a
little
time
would
not
add
his
perception
of
the
striking
improvement
of
harriet
s
manner
since
her
introduction
at
hartfield
was
not
one
of
the
least
agreeable
proofs
of
his
growing
attachment
you
have
given
miss
smith
all
that
she
required
said
he
you
have
made
her
graceful
and
easy
she
was
a
beautiful
creature
when
she
came
to
you
but
in
my
opinion
the
attractions
you
have
added
are
infinitely
superior
to
what
she
received
from
nature
i
am
glad
you
think
i
have
been
useful
to
her
but
harriet
only
wanted
drawing
out
and
receiving
a
few
very
few
hints
she
had
all
the
natural
grace
of
sweetness
of
temper
and
artlessness
in
herself
i
have
done
very
little
if
it
were
admissible
to
contradict
a
lady
said
the
gallant
mr
elton
i
have
perhaps
given
her
a
little
more
decision
of
character
have
taught
her
to
think
on
points
which
had
not
fallen
in
her
way
before
exactly
so
that
is
what
principally
strikes
me
so
much
superadded
decision
of
character
skilful
has
been
the
hand
great
has
been
the
pleasure
i
am
sure
i
never
met
with
a
disposition
more
truly
amiable
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
and
it
was
spoken
with
a
sort
of
sighing
animation
which
had
a
vast
deal
of
the
lover
she
was
not
less
pleased
another
day
with
the
manner
in
which
he
seconded
a
sudden
wish
of
hers
to
have
harriet
s
picture
did
you
ever
have
your
likeness
taken
harriet
said
she
did
you
ever
sit
for
your
picture
harriet
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
and
only
stopt
to
say
with
a
very
interesting
naivete
oh
dear
no
never
no
sooner
was
she
out
of
sight
than
emma
exclaimed
what
an
exquisite
possession
a
good
picture
of
her
would
be
i
would
give
any
money
for
it
i
almost
long
to
attempt
her
likeness
myself
you
do
not
know
it
i
dare
say
but
two
or
three
years
ago
i
had
a
great
passion
for
taking
likenesses
and
attempted
several
of
my
friends
and
was
thought
to
have
a
tolerable
eye
in
general
but
from
one
cause
or
another
i
gave
it
up
in
disgust
but
really
i
could
almost
venture
if
harriet
would
sit
to
me
it
would
be
such
a
delight
to
have
her
picture
let
me
entreat
you
cried
mr
elton
it
would
indeed
be
a
delight
let
me
entreat
you
miss
woodhouse
to
exercise
so
charming
a
talent
in
favour
of
your
friend
i
know
what
your
drawings
are
how
could
you
suppose
me
ignorant
is
not
this
room
rich
in
specimens
of
your
landscapes
and
flowers
and
has
not
mrs
weston
some
inimitable
figure
pieces
in
her
drawing
room
at
randalls
yes
good
man
thought
emma
but
what
has
all
that
to
do
with
taking
likenesses
you
know
nothing
of
drawing
don
t
pretend
to
be
in
raptures
about
mine
keep
your
raptures
for
harriet
s
face
well
if
you
give
me
such
kind
encouragement
mr
elton
i
believe
i
shall
try
what
i
can
do
harriet
s
features
are
very
delicate
which
makes
a
likeness
difficult
and
yet
there
is
a
peculiarity
in
the
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
which
one
ought
to
catch
exactly
so
the
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
your
success
pray
pray
attempt
it
as
you
will
do
it
it
will
indeed
to
use
your
own
words
be
an
exquisite
possession
but
i
am
afraid
mr
elton
harriet
will
not
like
to
sit
she
thinks
so
little
of
her
own
beauty
did
not
you
observe
her
manner
of
answering
me
how
completely
it
meant
why
should
my
picture
be
drawn
oh
yes
i
observed
it
i
assure
you
it
was
not
lost
on
me
but
still
i
cannot
imagine
she
would
not
be
persuaded
harriet
was
soon
back
again
and
the
proposal
almost
immediately
made
and
she
had
no
scruples
which
could
stand
many
minutes
against
the
earnest
pressing
of
both
the
others
emma
wished
to
go
to
work
directly
and
therefore
produced
the
portfolio
containing
her
various
attempts
at
portraits
for
not
one
of
them
had
ever
been
finished
that
they
might
decide
together
on
the
best
size
for
harriet
her
many
beginnings
were
displayed
miniatures
half
lengths
whole
lengths
pencil
crayon
and
water
colours
had
been
all
tried
in
turn
she
had
always
wanted
to
do
every
thing
and
had
made
more
progress
both
in
drawing
and
music
than
many
might
have
done
with
so
little
labour
as
she
would
ever
submit
to
she
played
and
sang
and
drew
in
almost
every
style
but
steadiness
had
always
been
wanting
and
in
nothing
had
she
approached
the
degree
of
excellence
which
she
would
have
been
glad
to
command
and
ought
not
to
have
failed
of
she
was
not
much
deceived
as
to
her
own
skill
either
as
an
artist
or
a
musician
but
she
was
not
unwilling
to
have
others
deceived
or
sorry
to
know
her
reputation
for
accomplishment
often
higher
than
it
deserved
there
was
merit
in
every
drawing
in
the
least
finished
perhaps
the
most
her
style
was
spirited
but
had
there
been
much
less
or
had
there
been
ten
times
more
the
delight
and
admiration
of
her
two
companions
would
have
been
the
same
they
were
both
in
ecstasies
a
likeness
pleases
every
body
and
miss
woodhouse
s
performances
must
be
capital
no
great
variety
of
faces
for
you
said
emma
i
had
only
my
own
family
to
study
from
there
is
my
father
another
of
my
father
but
the
idea
of
sitting
for
his
picture
made
him
so
nervous
that
i
could
only
take
him
by
stealth
neither
of
them
very
like
therefore
mrs
weston
again
and
again
and
again
you
see
dear
mrs
weston
always
my
kindest
friend
on
every
occasion
she
would
sit
whenever
i
asked
her
there
is
my
sister
and
really
quite
her
own
little
elegant
figure
and
the
face
not
unlike
i
should
have
made
a
good
likeness
of
her
if
she
would
have
sat
longer
but
she
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
have
me
draw
her
four
children
that
she
would
not
be
quiet
then
here
come
all
my
attempts
at
three
of
those
four
children
there
they
are
henry
and
john
and
bella
from
one
end
of
the
sheet
to
the
other
and
any
one
of
them
might
do
for
any
one
of
the
rest
she
was
so
eager
to
have
them
drawn
that
i
could
not
refuse
but
there
is
no
making
children
of
three
or
four
years
old
stand
still
you
know
nor
can
it
be
very
easy
to
take
any
likeness
of
them
beyond
the
air
and
complexion
unless
they
are
coarser
featured
than
any
of
mama
s
children
ever
were
here
is
my
sketch
of
the
fourth
who
was
a
baby
i
took
him
as
he
was
sleeping
on
the
sofa
and
it
is
as
strong
a
likeness
of
his
cockade
as
you
would
wish
to
see
he
had
nestled
down
his
head
most
conveniently
that
s
very
like
i
am
rather
proud
of
little
george
the
corner
of
the
sofa
is
very
good
then
here
is
my
last
unclosing
a
pretty
sketch
of
a
gentleman
in
small
size
whole
length
my
last
and
my
best
my
brother
mr
john
knightley
this
did
not
want
much
of
being
finished
when
i
put
it
away
in
a
pet
and
vowed
i
would
never
take
another
likeness
i
could
not
help
being
provoked
for
after
all
my
pains
and
when
i
had
really
made
a
very
good
likeness
of
it
mrs
weston
and
i
were
quite
agreed
in
thinking
it
very
like
only
too
handsome
too
flattering
but
that
was
a
fault
on
the
right
side
after
all
this
came
poor
dear
isabella
s
cold
approbation
of
yes
it
was
a
little
like
but
to
be
sure
it
did
not
do
him
justice
we
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
persuading
him
to
sit
at
all
it
was
made
a
great
favour
of
and
altogether
it
was
more
than
i
could
bear
and
so
i
never
would
finish
it
to
have
it
apologised
over
as
an
unfavourable
likeness
to
every
morning
visitor
in
brunswick
square
and
as
i
said
i
did
then
forswear
ever
drawing
any
body
again
but
for
harriet
s
sake
or
rather
for
my
own
and
as
there
are
no
husbands
and
wives
in
the
case
at
present
i
will
break
my
resolution
now
mr
elton
seemed
very
properly
struck
and
delighted
by
the
idea
and
was
repeating
no
husbands
and
wives
in
the
case
at
present
indeed
as
you
observe
exactly
so
no
husbands
and
wives
with
so
interesting
a
consciousness
that
emma
began
to
consider
whether
she
had
not
better
leave
them
together
at
once
but
as
she
wanted
to
be
drawing
the
declaration
must
wait
a
little
longer
she
had
soon
fixed
on
the
size
and
sort
of
portrait
it
was
to
be
a
whole
length
in
water
colours
like
mr
john
knightley
s
and
was
destined
if
she
could
please
herself
to
hold
a
very
honourable
station
over
the
mantelpiece
the
sitting
began
and
harriet
smiling
and
blushing
and
afraid
of
not
keeping
her
attitude
and
countenance
presented
a
very
sweet
mixture
of
youthful
expression
to
the
steady
eyes
of
the
artist
but
there
was
no
doing
any
thing
with
mr
elton
fidgeting
behind
her
and
watching
every
touch
she
gave
him
credit
for
stationing
himself
where
he
might
gaze
and
gaze
again
without
offence
but
was
really
obliged
to
put
an
end
to
it
and
request
him
to
place
himself
elsewhere
it
then
occurred
to
her
to
employ
him
in
reading
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
read
to
them
it
would
be
a
kindness
indeed
it
would
amuse
away
the
difficulties
of
her
part
and
lessen
the
irksomeness
of
miss
smith
s
mr
elton
was
only
too
happy
harriet
listened
and
emma
drew
in
peace
she
must
allow
him
to
be
still
frequently
coming
to
look
any
thing
less
would
certainly
have
been
too
little
in
a
lover
and
he
was
ready
at
the
smallest
intermission
of
the
pencil
to
jump
up
and
see
the
progress
and
be
charmed
there
was
no
being
displeased
with
such
an
encourager
for
his
admiration
made
him
discern
a
likeness
almost
before
it
was
possible
she
could
not
respect
his
eye
but
his
love
and
his
complaisance
were
unexceptionable
the
sitting
was
altogether
very
satisfactory
she
was
quite
enough
pleased
with
the
first
day
s
sketch
to
wish
to
go
on
there
was
no
want
of
likeness
she
had
been
fortunate
in
the
attitude
and
as
she
meant
to
throw
in
a
little
improvement
to
the
figure
to
give
a
little
more
height
and
considerably
more
elegance
she
had
great
confidence
of
its
being
in
every
way
a
pretty
drawing
at
last
and
of
its
filling
its
destined
place
with
credit
to
them
both
a
standing
memorial
of
the
beauty
of
one
the
skill
of
the
other
and
the
friendship
of
both
with
as
many
other
agreeable
associations
as
mr
elton
s
very
promising
attachment
was
likely
to
add
harriet
was
to
sit
again
the
next
day
and
mr
elton
just
as
he
ought
entreated
for
the
permission
of
attending
and
reading
to
them
again
by
all
means
we
shall
be
most
happy
to
consider
you
as
one
of
the
party
the
same
civilities
and
courtesies
the
same
success
and
satisfaction
took
place
on
the
morrow
and
accompanied
the
whole
progress
of
the
picture
which
was
rapid
and
happy
every
body
who
saw
it
was
pleased
but
mr
elton
was
in
continual
raptures
and
defended
it
through
every
criticism
miss
woodhouse
has
given
her
friend
the
only
beauty
she
wanted
observed
mrs
weston
to
him
not
in
the
least
suspecting
that
she
was
addressing
a
lover
the
expression
of
the
eye
is
most
correct
but
miss
smith
has
not
those
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
it
is
the
fault
of
her
face
that
she
has
them
not
do
you
think
so
replied
he
i
cannot
agree
with
you
it
appears
to
me
a
most
perfect
resemblance
in
every
feature
i
never
saw
such
a
likeness
in
my
life
we
must
allow
for
the
effect
of
shade
you
know
you
have
made
her
too
tall
emma
said
mr
knightley
emma
knew
that
she
had
but
would
not
own
it
and
mr
elton
warmly
added
oh
no
certainly
not
too
tall
not
in
the
least
too
tall
consider
she
is
sitting
down
which
naturally
presents
a
different
which
in
short
gives
exactly
the
idea
and
the
proportions
must
be
preserved
you
know
proportions
fore
shortening
oh
no
it
gives
one
exactly
the
idea
of
such
a
height
as
miss
smith
s
exactly
so
indeed
it
is
very
pretty
said
mr
woodhouse
so
prettily
done
just
as
your
drawings
always
are
my
dear
i
do
not
know
any
body
who
draws
so
well
as
you
do
the
only
thing
i
do
not
thoroughly
like
is
that
she
seems
to
be
sitting
out
of
doors
with
only
a
little
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
it
makes
one
think
she
must
catch
cold
but
my
dear
papa
it
is
supposed
to
be
summer
a
warm
day
in
summer
look
at
the
tree
but
it
is
never
safe
to
sit
out
of
doors
my
dear
you
sir
may
say
any
thing
cried
mr
elton
but
i
must
confess
that
i
regard
it
as
a
most
happy
thought
the
placing
of
miss
smith
out
of
doors
and
the
tree
is
touched
with
such
inimitable
spirit
any
other
situation
would
have
been
much
less
in
character
the
naivete
of
miss
smith
s
manners
and
altogether
oh
it
is
most
admirable
i
cannot
keep
my
eyes
from
it
i
never
saw
such
a
likeness
the
next
thing
wanted
was
to
get
the
picture
framed
and
here
were
a
few
difficulties
it
must
be
done
directly
it
must
be
done
in
london
the
order
must
go
through
the
hands
of
some
intelligent
person
whose
taste
could
be
depended
on
and
isabella
the
usual
doer
of
all
commissions
must
not
be
applied
to
because
it
was
december
and
mr
woodhouse
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
her
stirring
out
of
her
house
in
the
fogs
of
december
but
no
sooner
was
the
distress
known
to
mr
elton
than
it
was
removed
his
gallantry
was
always
on
the
alert
might
he
be
trusted
with
the
commission
what
infinite
pleasure
should
he
have
in
executing
it
he
could
ride
to
london
at
any
time
it
was
impossible
to
say
how
much
he
should
be
gratified
by
being
employed
on
such
an
errand
he
was
too
good
she
could
not
endure
the
thought
she
would
not
give
him
such
a
troublesome
office
for
the
world
brought
on
the
desired
repetition
of
entreaties
and
assurances
and
a
very
few
minutes
settled
the
business
mr
elton
was
to
take
the
drawing
to
london
chuse
the
frame
and
give
the
directions
and
emma
thought
she
could
so
pack
it
as
to
ensure
its
safety
without
much
incommoding
him
while
he
seemed
mostly
fearful
of
not
being
incommoded
enough
what
a
precious
deposit
said
he
with
a
tender
sigh
as
he
received
it
this
man
is
almost
too
gallant
to
be
in
love
thought
emma
i
should
say
so
but
that
i
suppose
there
may
be
a
hundred
different
ways
of
being
in
love
he
is
an
excellent
young
man
and
will
suit
harriet
exactly
it
will
be
an
exactly
so
as
he
says
himself
but
he
does
sigh
and
languish
and
study
for
compliments
rather
more
than
i
could
endure
as
a
principal
i
come
in
for
a
pretty
good
share
as
a
second
but
it
is
his
gratitude
on
harriet
s
account
chapter
vii
the
very
day
of
mr
elton
s
going
to
london
produced
a
fresh
occasion
for
emma
s
services
towards
her
friend
harriet
had
been
at
hartfield
as
usual
soon
after
breakfast
and
after
a
time
had
gone
home
to
return
again
to
dinner
she
returned
and
sooner
than
had
been
talked
of
and
with
an
agitated
hurried
look
announcing
something
extraordinary
to
have
happened
which
she
was
longing
to
tell
half
a
minute
brought
it
all
out
she
had
heard
as
soon
as
she
got
back
to
mrs
goddard
s
that
mr
martin
had
been
there
an
hour
before
and
finding
she
was
not
at
home
nor
particularly
expected
had
left
a
little
parcel
for
her
from
one
of
his
sisters
and
gone
away
and
on
opening
this
parcel
she
had
actually
found
besides
the
two
songs
which
she
had
lent
elizabeth
to
copy
a
letter
to
herself
and
this
letter
was
from
him
from
mr
martin
and
contained
a
direct
proposal
of
marriage
who
could
have
thought
it
she
was
so
surprized
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
yes
quite
a
proposal
of
marriage
and
a
very
good
letter
at
least
she
thought
so
and
he
wrote
as
if
he
really
loved
her
very
much
but
she
did
not
know
and
so
she
was
come
as
fast
as
she
could
to
ask
miss
woodhouse
what
she
should
do
emma
was
half
ashamed
of
her
friend
for
seeming
so
pleased
and
so
doubtful
upon
my
word
she
cried
the
young
man
is
determined
not
to
lose
any
thing
for
want
of
asking
he
will
connect
himself
well
if
he
can
will
you
read
the
letter
cried
harriet
pray
do
i
d
rather
you
would
emma
was
not
sorry
to
be
pressed
she
read
and
was
surprized
the
style
of
the
letter
was
much
above
her
expectation
there
were
not
merely
no
grammatical
errors
but
as
a
composition
it
would
not
have
disgraced
a
gentleman
the
language
though
plain
was
strong
and
unaffected
and
the
sentiments
it
conveyed
very
much
to
the
credit
of
the
writer
it
was
short
but
expressed
good
sense
warm
attachment
liberality
propriety
even
delicacy
of
feeling
she
paused
over
it
while
harriet
stood
anxiously
watching
for
her
opinion
with
a
well
well
and
was
at
last
forced
to
add
is
it
a
good
letter
or
is
it
too
short
yes
indeed
a
very
good
letter
replied
emma
rather
slowly
so
good
a
letter
harriet
that
every
thing
considered
i
think
one
of
his
sisters
must
have
helped
him
i
can
hardly
imagine
the
young
man
whom
i
saw
talking
with
you
the
other
day
could
express
himself
so
well
if
left
quite
to
his
own
powers
and
yet
it
is
not
the
style
of
a
woman
no
certainly
it
is
too
strong
and
concise
not
diffuse
enough
for
a
woman
no
doubt
he
is
a
sensible
man
and
i
suppose
may
have
a
natural
talent
for
thinks
strongly
and
clearly
and
when
he
takes
a
pen
in
hand
his
thoughts
naturally
find
proper
words
it
is
so
with
some
men
yes
i
understand
the
sort
of
mind
vigorous
decided
with
sentiments
to
a
certain
point
not
coarse
a
better
written
letter
harriet
returning
it
than
i
had
expected
well
said
the
still
waiting
harriet
well
and
and
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
you
do
in
what
respect
do
you
mean
with
regard
to
this
letter
yes
but
what
are
you
in
doubt
of
you
must
answer
it
of
course
and
speedily
yes
but
what
shall
i
say
dear
miss
woodhouse
do
advise
me
oh
no
no
the
letter
had
much
better
be
all
your
own
you
will
express
yourself
very
properly
i
am
sure
there
is
no
danger
of
your
not
being
intelligible
which
is
the
first
thing
your
meaning
must
be
unequivocal
no
doubts
or
demurs
and
such
expressions
of
gratitude
and
concern
for
the
pain
you
are
inflicting
as
propriety
requires
will
present
themselves
unbidden
to
your
mind
i
am
persuaded
you
need
not
be
prompted
to
write
with
the
appearance
of
sorrow
for
his
disappointment
you
think
i
ought
to
refuse
him
then
said
harriet
looking
down
ought
to
refuse
him
my
dear
harriet
what
do
you
mean
are
you
in
any
doubt
as
to
that
i
thought
but
i
beg
your
pardon
perhaps
i
have
been
under
a
mistake
i
certainly
have
been
misunderstanding
you
if
you
feel
in
doubt
as
to
the
purport
of
your
answer
i
had
imagined
you
were
consulting
me
only
as
to
the
wording
of
it
harriet
was
silent
with
a
little
reserve
of
manner
emma
continued
you
mean
to
return
a
favourable
answer
i
collect
no
i
do
not
that
is
i
do
not
mean
what
shall
i
do
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
pray
dear
miss
woodhouse
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
i
shall
not
give
you
any
advice
harriet
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
this
is
a
point
which
you
must
settle
with
your
feelings
i
had
no
notion
that
he
liked
me
so
very
much
said
harriet
contemplating
the
letter
for
a
little
while
emma
persevered
in
her
silence
but
beginning
to
apprehend
the
bewitching
flattery
of
that
letter
might
be
too
powerful
she
thought
it
best
to
say
i
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
harriet
that
if
a
woman
doubts
as
to
whether
she
should
accept
a
man
or
not
she
certainly
ought
to
refuse
him
if
she
can
hesitate
as
to
yes
she
ought
to
say
no
directly
it
is
not
a
state
to
be
safely
entered
into
with
doubtful
feelings
with
half
a
heart
i
thought
it
my
duty
as
a
friend
and
older
than
yourself
to
say
thus
much
to
you
but
do
not
imagine
that
i
want
to
influence
you
oh
no
i
am
sure
you
are
a
great
deal
too
kind
to
but
if
you
would
just
advise
me
what
i
had
best
do
no
no
i
do
not
mean
that
as
you
say
one
s
mind
ought
to
be
quite
made
up
one
should
not
be
hesitating
it
is
a
very
serious
thing
it
will
be
safer
to
say
no
perhaps
do
you
think
i
had
better
say
no
not
for
the
world
said
emma
smiling
graciously
would
i
advise
you
either
way
you
must
be
the
best
judge
of
your
own
happiness
if
you
prefer
mr
martin
to
every
other
person
if
you
think
him
the
most
agreeable
man
you
have
ever
been
in
company
with
why
should
you
hesitate
you
blush
harriet
does
any
body
else
occur
to
you
at
this
moment
under
such
a
definition
harriet
harriet
do
not
deceive
yourself
do
not
be
run
away
with
by
gratitude
and
compassion
at
this
moment
whom
are
you
thinking
of
the
symptoms
were
favourable
instead
of
answering
harriet
turned
away
confused
and
stood
thoughtfully
by
the
fire
and
though
the
letter
was
still
in
her
hand
it
was
now
mechanically
twisted
about
without
regard
emma
waited
the
result
with
impatience
but
not
without
strong
hopes
at
last
with
some
hesitation
harriet
said
miss
woodhouse
as
you
will
not
give
me
your
opinion
i
must
do
as
well
as
i
can
by
myself
and
i
have
now
quite
determined
and
really
almost
made
up
my
mind
to
refuse
mr
martin
do
you
think
i
am
right
perfectly
perfectly
right
my
dearest
harriet
you
are
doing
just
what
you
ought
while
you
were
at
all
in
suspense
i
kept
my
feelings
to
myself
but
now
that
you
are
so
completely
decided
i
have
no
hesitation
in
approving
dear
harriet
i
give
myself
joy
of
this
it
would
have
grieved
me
to
lose
your
acquaintance
which
must
have
been
the
consequence
of
your
marrying
mr
martin
while
you
were
in
the
smallest
degree
wavering
i
said
nothing
about
it
because
i
would
not
influence
but
it
would
have
been
the
loss
of
a
friend
to
me
i
could
not
have
visited
mrs
robert
martin
of
abbey
mill
farm
now
i
am
secure
of
you
for
ever
harriet
had
not
surmised
her
own
danger
but
the
idea
of
it
struck
her
forcibly
you
could
not
have
visited
me
she
cried
looking
aghast
no
to
be
sure
you
could
not
but
i
never
thought
of
that
before
that
would
have
been
too
dreadful
what
an
escape
dear
miss
woodhouse
i
would
not
give
up
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
being
intimate
with
you
for
any
thing
in
the
world
indeed
harriet
it
would
have
been
a
severe
pang
to
lose
you
but
it
must
have
been
you
would
have
thrown
yourself
out
of
all
good
society
i
must
have
given
you
up
dear
me
how
should
i
ever
have
borne
it
it
would
have
killed
me
never
to
come
to
hartfield
any
more
dear
affectionate
creature
you
banished
to
abbey
mill
farm
you
confined
to
the
society
of
the
illiterate
and
vulgar
all
your
life
i
wonder
how
the
young
man
could
have
the
assurance
to
ask
it
he
must
have
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
himself
i
do
not
think
he
is
conceited
either
in
general
said
harriet
her
conscience
opposing
such
censure
at
least
he
is
very
good
natured
and
i
shall
always
feel
much
obliged
to
him
and
have
a
great
regard
for
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
and
you
know
though
he
may
like
me
it
does
not
follow
that
i
should
and
certainly
i
must
confess
that
since
my
visiting
here
i
have
seen
people
and
if
one
comes
to
compare
them
person
and
manners
there
is
no
comparison
at
all
one
is
so
very
handsome
and
agreeable
however
i
do
really
think
mr
martin
a
very
amiable
young
man
and
have
a
great
opinion
of
him
and
his
being
so
much
attached
to
me
and
his
writing
such
a
letter
but
as
to
leaving
you
it
is
what
i
would
not
do
upon
any
consideration
thank
you
thank
you
my
own
sweet
little
friend
we
will
not
be
parted
a
woman
is
not
to
marry
a
man
merely
because
she
is
asked
or
because
he
is
attached
to
her
and
can
write
a
tolerable
letter
oh
no
and
it
is
but
a
short
letter
too
emma
felt
the
bad
taste
of
her
friend
but
let
it
pass
with
a
very
true
and
it
would
be
a
small
consolation
to
her
for
the
clownish
manner
which
might
be
offending
her
every
hour
of
the
day
to
know
that
her
husband
could
write
a
good
letter
oh
yes
very
nobody
cares
for
a
letter
the
thing
is
to
be
always
happy
with
pleasant
companions
i
am
quite
determined
to
refuse
him
but
how
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
say
emma
assured
her
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
answer
and
advised
its
being
written
directly
which
was
agreed
to
in
the
hope
of
her
assistance
and
though
emma
continued
to
protest
against
any
assistance
being
wanted
it
was
in
fact
given
in
the
formation
of
every
sentence
the
looking
over
his
letter
again
in
replying
to
it
had
such
a
softening
tendency
that
it
was
particularly
necessary
to
brace
her
up
with
a
few
decisive
expressions
and
she
was
so
very
much
concerned
at
the
idea
of
making
him
unhappy
and
thought
so
much
of
what
his
mother
and
sisters
would
think
and
say
and
was
so
anxious
that
they
should
not
fancy
her
ungrateful
that
emma
believed
if
the
young
man
had
come
in
her
way
at
that
moment
he
would
have
been
accepted
after
all
this
letter
however
was
written
and
sealed
and
sent
the
business
was
finished
and
harriet
safe
she
was
rather
low
all
the
evening
but
emma
could
allow
for
her
amiable
regrets
and
sometimes
relieved
them
by
speaking
of
her
own
affection
sometimes
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
mr
elton
i
shall
never
be
invited
to
abbey
mill
again
was
said
in
rather
a
sorrowful
tone
nor
if
you
were
could
i
ever
bear
to
part
with
you
my
harriet
you
are
a
great
deal
too
necessary
at
hartfield
to
be
spared
to
abbey
mill
and
i
am
sure
i
should
never
want
to
go
there
for
i
am
never
happy
but
at
hartfield
some
time
afterwards
it
was
i
think
mrs
goddard
would
be
very
much
surprized
if
she
knew
what
had
happened
i
am
sure
miss
nash
would
for
miss
nash
thinks
her
own
sister
very
well
married
and
it
is
only
a
linen
draper
one
should
be
sorry
to
see
greater
pride
or
refinement
in
the
teacher
of
a
school
harriet
i
dare
say
miss
nash
would
envy
you
such
an
opportunity
as
this
of
being
married
even
this
conquest
would
appear
valuable
in
her
eyes
as
to
any
thing
superior
for
you
i
suppose
she
is
quite
in
the
dark
the
attentions
of
a
certain
person
can
hardly
be
among
the
tittle
tattle
of
highbury
yet
hitherto
i
fancy
you
and
i
are
the
only
people
to
whom
his
looks
and
manners
have
explained
themselves
harriet
blushed
and
smiled
and
said
something
about
wondering
that
people
should
like
her
so
much
the
idea
of
mr
elton
was
certainly
cheering
but
still
after
a
time
she
was
tender
hearted
again
towards
the
rejected
mr
martin
now
he
has
got
my
letter
said
she
softly
i
wonder
what
they
are
all
doing
whether
his
sisters
know
if
he
is
unhappy
they
will
be
unhappy
too
i
hope
he
will
not
mind
it
so
very
much
let
us
think
of
those
among
our
absent
friends
who
are
more
cheerfully
employed
cried
emma
at
this
moment
perhaps
mr
elton
is
shewing
your
picture
to
his
mother
and
sisters
telling
how
much
more
beautiful
is
the
original
and
after
being
asked
for
it
five
or
six
times
allowing
them
to
hear
your
name
your
own
dear
name
my
picture
but
he
has
left
my
picture
in
bond
street
has
he
so
then
i
know
nothing
of
mr
elton
no
my
dear
little
modest
harriet
depend
upon
it
the
picture
will
not
be
in
bond
street
till
just
before
he
mounts
his
horse
to
morrow
it
is
his
companion
all
this
evening
his
solace
his
delight
it
opens
his
designs
to
his
family
it
introduces
you
among
them
it
diffuses
through
the
party
those
pleasantest
feelings
of
our
nature
eager
curiosity
and
warm
prepossession
how
cheerful
how
animated
how
suspicious
how
busy
their
imaginations
all
are
harriet
smiled
again
and
her
smiles
grew
stronger
chapter
viii
harriet
slept
at
hartfield
that
night
for
some
weeks
past
she
had
been
spending
more
than
half
her
time
there
and
gradually
getting
to
have
a
bed
room
appropriated
to
herself
and
emma
judged
it
best
in
every
respect
safest
and
kindest
to
keep
her
with
them
as
much
as
possible
just
at
present
she
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
morning
for
an
hour
or
two
to
mrs
goddard
s
but
it
was
then
to
be
settled
that
she
should
return
to
hartfield
to
make
a
regular
visit
of
some
days
while
she
was
gone
mr
knightley
called
and
sat
some
time
with
mr
woodhouse
and
emma
till
mr
woodhouse
who
had
previously
made
up
his
mind
to
walk
out
was
persuaded
by
his
daughter
not
to
defer
it
and
was
induced
by
the
entreaties
of
both
though
against
the
scruples
of
his
own
civility
to
leave
mr
knightley
for
that
purpose
mr
knightley
who
had
nothing
of
ceremony
about
him
was
offering
by
his
short
decided
answers
an
amusing
contrast
to
the
protracted
apologies
and
civil
hesitations
of
the
other
well
i
believe
if
you
will
excuse
me
mr
knightley
if
you
will
not
consider
me
as
doing
a
very
rude
thing
i
shall
take
emma
s
advice
and
go
out
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
as
the
sun
is
out
i
believe
i
had
better
take
my
three
turns
while
i
can
i
treat
you
without
ceremony
mr
knightley
we
invalids
think
we
are
privileged
people
my
dear
sir
do
not
make
a
stranger
of
me
i
leave
an
excellent
substitute
in
my
daughter
emma
will
be
happy
to
entertain
you
and
therefore
i
think
i
will
beg
your
excuse
and
take
my
three
turns
my
winter
walk
you
cannot
do
better
sir
i
would
ask
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company
mr
knightley
but
i
am
a
very
slow
walker
and
my
pace
would
be
tedious
to
you
and
besides
you
have
another
long
walk
before
you
to
donwell
abbey
thank
you
sir
thank
you
i
am
going
this
moment
myself
and
i
think
the
sooner
you
go
the
better
i
will
fetch
your
greatcoat
and
open
the
garden
door
for
you
mr
woodhouse
at
last
was
off
but
mr
knightley
instead
of
being
immediately
off
likewise
sat
down
again
seemingly
inclined
for
more
chat
he
began
speaking
of
harriet
and
speaking
of
her
with
more
voluntary
praise
than
emma
had
ever
heard
before
i
cannot
rate
her
beauty
as
you
do
said
he
but
she
is
a
pretty
little
creature
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
very
well
of
her
disposition
her
character
depends
upon
those
she
is
with
but
in
good
hands
she
will
turn
out
a
valuable
woman
i
am
glad
you
think
so
and
the
good
hands
i
hope
may
not
be
wanting
come
said
he
you
are
anxious
for
a
compliment
so
i
will
tell
you
that
you
have
improved
her
you
have
cured
her
of
her
school
girl
s
giggle
she
really
does
you
credit
thank
you
i
should
be
mortified
indeed
if
i
did
not
believe
i
had
been
of
some
use
but
it
is
not
every
body
who
will
bestow
praise
where
they
may
you
do
not
often
overpower
me
with
it
you
are
expecting
her
again
you
say
this
morning
almost
every
moment
she
has
been
gone
longer
already
than
she
intended
something
has
happened
to
delay
her
some
visitors
perhaps
highbury
gossips
tiresome
wretches
harriet
may
not
consider
every
body
tiresome
that
you
would
emma
knew
this
was
too
true
for
contradiction
and
therefore
said
nothing
he
presently
added
with
a
smile
i
do
not
pretend
to
fix
on
times
or
places
but
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
your
little
friend
will
soon
hear
of
something
to
her
advantage
indeed
how
so
of
what
sort
a
very
serious
sort
i
assure
you
still
smiling
very
serious
i
can
think
of
but
one
thing
who
is
in
love
with
her
who
makes
you
their
confidant
emma
was
more
than
half
in
hopes
of
mr
elton
s
having
dropt
a
hint
mr
knightley
was
a
sort
of
general
friend
and
adviser
and
she
knew
mr
elton
looked
up
to
him
i
have
reason
to
think
he
replied
that
harriet
smith
will
soon
have
an
offer
of
marriage
and
from
a
most
unexceptionable
quarter
robert
martin
is
the
man
her
visit
to
abbey
mill
this
summer
seems
to
have
done
his
business
he
is
desperately
in
love
and
means
to
marry
her
he
is
very
obliging
said
emma
but
is
he
sure
that
harriet
means
to
marry
him
well
well
means
to
make
her
an
offer
then
will
that
do
he
came
to
the
abbey
two
evenings
ago
on
purpose
to
consult
me
about
it
he
knows
i
have
a
thorough
regard
for
him
and
all
his
family
and
i
believe
considers
me
as
one
of
his
best
friends
he
came
to
ask
me
whether
i
thought
it
would
be
imprudent
in
him
to
settle
so
early
whether
i
thought
her
too
young
in
short
whether
i
approved
his
choice
altogether
having
some
apprehension
perhaps
of
her
being
considered
especially
since
your
making
so
much
of
her
as
in
a
line
of
society
above
him
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
he
said
i
never
hear
better
sense
from
any
one
than
robert
martin
he
always
speaks
to
the
purpose
open
straightforward
and
very
well
judging
he
told
me
every
thing
his
circumstances
and
plans
and
what
they
all
proposed
doing
in
the
event
of
his
marriage
he
is
an
excellent
young
man
both
as
son
and
brother
i
had
no
hesitation
in
advising
him
to
marry
he
proved
to
me
that
he
could
afford
it
and
that
being
the
case
i
was
convinced
he
could
not
do
better
i
praised
the
fair
lady
too
and
altogether
sent
him
away
very
happy
if
he
had
never
esteemed
my
opinion
before
he
would
have
thought
highly
of
me
then
and
i
dare
say
left
the
house
thinking
me
the
best
friend
and
counsellor
man
ever
had
this
happened
the
night
before
last
now
as
we
may
fairly
suppose
he
would
not
allow
much
time
to
pass
before
he
spoke
to
the
lady
and
as
he
does
not
appear
to
have
spoken
yesterday
it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
should
be
at
mrs
goddard
s
to
day
and
she
may
be
detained
by
a
visitor
without
thinking
him
at
all
a
tiresome
wretch
pray
mr
knightley
said
emma
who
had
been
smiling
to
herself
through
a
great
part
of
this
speech
how
do
you
know
that
mr
martin
did
not
speak
yesterday
certainly
replied
he
surprized
i
do
not
absolutely
know
it
but
it
may
be
inferred
was
not
she
the
whole
day
with
you
come
said
she
i
will
tell
you
something
in
return
for
what
you
have
told
me
he
did
speak
yesterday
that
is
he
wrote
and
was
refused
this
was
obliged
to
be
repeated
before
it
could
be
believed
and
mr
knightley
actually
looked
red
with
surprize
and
displeasure
as
he
stood
up
in
tall
indignation
and
said
then
she
is
a
greater
simpleton
than
i
ever
believed
her
what
is
the
foolish
girl
about
oh
to
be
sure
cried
emma
it
is
always
incomprehensible
to
a
man
that
a
woman
should
ever
refuse
an
offer
of
marriage
a
man
always
imagines
a
woman
to
be
ready
for
any
body
who
asks
her
nonsense
a
man
does
not
imagine
any
such
thing
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
harriet
smith
refuse
robert
martin
madness
if
it
is
so
but
i
hope
you
are
mistaken
i
saw
her
answer
nothing
could
be
clearer
you
saw
her
answer
you
wrote
her
answer
too
emma
this
is
your
doing
you
persuaded
her
to
refuse
him
and
if
i
did
which
however
i
am
far
from
allowing
i
should
not
feel
that
i
had
done
wrong
mr
martin
is
a
very
respectable
young
man
but
i
cannot
admit
him
to
be
harriet
s
equal
and
am
rather
surprized
indeed
that
he
should
have
ventured
to
address
her
by
your
account
he
does
seem
to
have
had
some
scruples
it
is
a
pity
that
they
were
ever
got
over
not
harriet
s
equal
exclaimed
mr
knightley
loudly
and
warmly
and
with
calmer
asperity
added
a
few
moments
afterwards
no
he
is
not
her
equal
indeed
for
he
is
as
much
her
superior
in
sense
as
in
situation
emma
your
infatuation
about
that
girl
blinds
you
what
are
harriet
smith
s
claims
either
of
birth
nature
or
education
to
any
connexion
higher
than
robert
martin
she
is
the
natural
daughter
of
nobody
knows
whom
with
probably
no
settled
provision
at
all
and
certainly
no
respectable
relations
she
is
known
only
as
parlour
boarder
at
a
common
school
she
is
not
a
sensible
girl
nor
a
girl
of
any
information
she
has
been
taught
nothing
useful
and
is
too
young
and
too
simple
to
have
acquired
any
thing
herself
at
her
age
she
can
have
no
experience
and
with
her
little
wit
is
not
very
likely
ever
to
have
any
that
can
avail
her
she
is
pretty
and
she
is
good
tempered
and
that
is
all
my
only
scruple
in
advising
the
match
was
on
his
account
as
being
beneath
his
deserts
and
a
bad
connexion
for
him
i
felt
that
as
to
fortune
in
all
probability
he
might
do
much
better
and
that
as
to
a
rational
companion
or
useful
helpmate
he
could
not
do
worse
but
i
could
not
reason
so
to
a
man
in
love
and
was
willing
to
trust
to
there
being
no
harm
in
her
to
her
having
that
sort
of
disposition
which
in
good
hands
like
his
might
be
easily
led
aright
and
turn
out
very
well
the
advantage
of
the
match
i
felt
to
be
all
on
her
side
and
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
nor
have
i
now
that
there
would
be
a
general
cry
out
upon
her
extreme
good
luck
even
your
satisfaction
i
made
sure
of
it
crossed
my
mind
immediately
that
you
would
not
regret
your
friend
s
leaving
highbury
for
the
sake
of
her
being
settled
so
well
i
remember
saying
to
myself
even
emma
with
all
her
partiality
for
harriet
will
think
this
a
good
match
i
cannot
help
wondering
at
your
knowing
so
little
of
emma
as
to
say
any
such
thing
what
think
a
farmer
and
with
all
his
sense
and
all
his
merit
mr
martin
is
nothing
more
a
good
match
for
my
intimate
friend
not
regret
her
leaving
highbury
for
the
sake
of
marrying
a
man
whom
i
could
never
admit
as
an
acquaintance
of
my
own
i
wonder
you
should
think
it
possible
for
me
to
have
such
feelings
i
assure
you
mine
are
very
different
i
must
think
your
statement
by
no
means
fair
you
are
not
just
to
harriet
s
claims
they
would
be
estimated
very
differently
by
others
as
well
as
myself
mr
martin
may
be
the
richest
of
the
two
but
he
is
undoubtedly
her
inferior
as
to
rank
in
society
the
sphere
in
which
she
moves
is
much
above
his
it
would
be
a
degradation
a
degradation
to
illegitimacy
and
ignorance
to
be
married
to
a
respectable
intelligent
gentleman
farmer
as
to
the
circumstances
of
her
birth
though
in
a
legal
sense
she
may
be
called
nobody
it
will
not
hold
in
common
sense
she
is
not
to
pay
for
the
offence
of
others
by
being
held
below
the
level
of
those
with
whom
she
is
brought
up
there
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
that
her
father
is
a
gentleman
and
a
gentleman
of
fortune
her
allowance
is
very
liberal
nothing
has
ever
been
grudged
for
her
improvement
or
comfort
that
she
is
a
gentleman
s
daughter
is
indubitable
to
me
that
she
associates
with
gentlemen
s
daughters
no
one
i
apprehend
will
deny
she
is
superior
to
mr
robert
martin
whoever
might
be
her
parents
said
mr
knightley
whoever
may
have
had
the
charge
of
her
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
part
of
their
plan
to
introduce
her
into
what
you
would
call
good
society
after
receiving
a
very
indifferent
education
she
is
left
in
mrs
goddard
s
hands
to
shift
as
she
can
to
move
in
short
in
mrs
goddard
s
line
to
have
mrs
goddard
s
acquaintance
her
friends
evidently
thought
this
good
enough
for
her
and
it
was
good
enough
she
desired
nothing
better
herself
till
you
chose
to
turn
her
into
a
friend
her
mind
had
no
distaste
for
her
own
set
nor
any
ambition
beyond
it
she
was
as
happy
as
possible
with
the
martins
in
the
summer
she
had
no
sense
of
superiority
then
if
she
has
it
now
you
have
given
it
you
have
been
no
friend
to
harriet
smith
emma
robert
martin
would
never
have
proceeded
so
far
if
he
had
not
felt
persuaded
of
her
not
being
disinclined
to
him
i
know
him
well
he
has
too
much
real
feeling
to
address
any
woman
on
the
haphazard
of
selfish
passion
and
as
to
conceit
he
is
the
farthest
from
it
of
any
man
i
know
depend
upon
it
he
had
encouragement
it
was
most
convenient
to
emma
not
to
make
a
direct
reply
to
this
assertion
she
chose
rather
to
take
up
her
own
line
of
the
subject
again
you
are
a
very
warm
friend
to
mr
martin
but
as
i
said
before
are
unjust
to
harriet
harriet
s
claims
to
marry
well
are
not
so
contemptible
as
you
represent
them
she
is
not
a
clever
girl
but
she
has
better
sense
than
you
are
aware
of
and
does
not
deserve
to
have
her
understanding
spoken
of
so
slightingly
waiving
that
point
however
and
supposing
her
to
be
as
you
describe
her
only
pretty
and
good
natured
let
me
tell
you
that
in
the
degree
she
possesses
them
they
are
not
trivial
recommendations
to
the
world
in
general
for
she
is
in
fact
a
beautiful
girl
and
must
be
thought
so
by
ninety
nine
people
out
of
an
hundred
and
till
it
appears
that
men
are
much
more
philosophic
on
the
subject
of
beauty
than
they
are
generally
supposed
till
they
do
fall
in
love
with
well
informed
minds
instead
of
handsome
faces
a
girl
with
such
loveliness
as
harriet
has
a
certainty
of
being
admired
and
sought
after
of
having
the
power
of
chusing
from
among
many
consequently
a
claim
to
be
nice
her
good
nature
too
is
not
so
very
slight
a
claim
comprehending
as
it
does
real
thorough
sweetness
of
temper
and
manner
a
very
humble
opinion
of
herself
and
a
great
readiness
to
be
pleased
with
other
people
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
your
sex
in
general
would
not
think
such
beauty
and
such
temper
the
highest
claims
a
woman
could
possess
upon
my
word
emma
to
hear
you
abusing
the
reason
you
have
is
almost
enough
to
make
me
think
so
too
better
be
without
sense
than
misapply
it
as
you
do
to
be
sure
cried
she
playfully
i
know
that
is
the
feeling
of
you
all
i
know
that
such
a
girl
as
harriet
is
exactly
what
every
man
delights
in
what
at
once
bewitches
his
senses
and
satisfies
his
judgment
oh
harriet
may
pick
and
chuse
were
you
yourself
ever
to
marry
she
is
the
very
woman
for
you
and
is
she
at
seventeen
just
entering
into
life
just
beginning
to
be
known
to
be
wondered
at
because
she
does
not
accept
the
first
offer
she
receives
no
pray
let
her
have
time
to
look
about
her
i
have
always
thought
it
a
very
foolish
intimacy
said
mr
knightley
presently
though
i
have
kept
my
thoughts
to
myself
but
i
now
perceive
that
it
will
be
a
very
unfortunate
one
for
harriet
you
will
puff
her
up
with
such
ideas
of
her
own
beauty
and
of
what
she
has
a
claim
to
that
in
a
little
while
nobody
within
her
reach
will
be
good
enough
for
her
vanity
working
on
a
weak
head
produces
every
sort
of
mischief
nothing
so
easy
as
for
a
young
lady
to
raise
her
expectations
too
high
miss
harriet
smith
may
not
find
offers
of
marriage
flow
in
so
fast
though
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl
men
of
sense
whatever
you
may
chuse
to
say
do
not
want
silly
wives
men
of
family
would
not
be
very
fond
of
connecting
themselves
with
a
girl
of
such
obscurity
and
most
prudent
men
would
be
afraid
of
the
inconvenience
and
disgrace
they
might
be
involved
in
when
the
mystery
of
her
parentage
came
to
be
revealed
let
her
marry
robert
martin
and
she
is
safe
respectable
and
happy
for
ever
but
if
you
encourage
her
to
expect
to
marry
greatly
and
teach
her
to
be
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
a
man
of
consequence
and
large
fortune
she
may
be
a
parlour
boarder
at
mrs
goddard
s
all
the
rest
of
her
life
or
at
least
for
harriet
smith
is
a
girl
who
will
marry
somebody
or
other
till
she
grow
desperate
and
is
glad
to
catch
at
the
old
writing
master
s
son
we
think
so
very
differently
on
this
point
mr
knightley
that
there
can
be
no
use
in
canvassing
it
we
shall
only
be
making
each
other
more
angry
but
as
to
my
letting
her
marry
robert
martin
it
is
impossible
she
has
refused
him
and
so
decidedly
i
think
as
must
prevent
any
second
application
she
must
abide
by
the
evil
of
having
refused
him
whatever
it
may
be
and
as
to
the
refusal
itself
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
i
might
not
influence
her
a
little
but
i
assure
you
there
was
very
little
for
me
or
for
any
body
to
do
his
appearance
is
so
much
against
him
and
his
manner
so
bad
that
if
she
ever
were
disposed
to
favour
him
she
is
not
now
i
can
imagine
that
before
she
had
seen
any
body
superior
she
might
tolerate
him
he
was
the
brother
of
her
friends
and
he
took
pains
to
please
her
and
altogether
having
seen
nobody
better
that
must
have
been
his
great
assistant
she
might
not
while
she
was
at
abbey
mill
find
him
disagreeable
but
the
case
is
altered
now
she
knows
now
what
gentlemen
are
and
nothing
but
a
gentleman
in
education
and
manner
has
any
chance
with
harriet
nonsense
errant
nonsense
as
ever
was
talked
cried
mr
knightley
robert
martin
s
manners
have
sense
sincerity
and
good
humour
to
recommend
them
and
his
mind
has
more
true
gentility
than
harriet
smith
could
understand
emma
made
no
answer
and
tried
to
look
cheerfully
unconcerned
but
was
really
feeling
uncomfortable
and
wanting
him
very
much
to
be
gone
she
did
not
repent
what
she
had
done
she
still
thought
herself
a
better
judge
of
such
a
point
of
female
right
and
refinement
than
he
could
be
but
yet
she
had
a
sort
of
habitual
respect
for
his
judgment
in
general
which
made
her
dislike
having
it
so
loudly
against
her
and
to
have
him
sitting
just
opposite
to
her
in
angry
state
was
very
disagreeable
some
minutes
passed
in
this
unpleasant
silence
with
only
one
attempt
on
emma
s
side
to
talk
of
the
weather
but
he
made
no
answer
he
was
thinking
the
result
of
his
thoughts
appeared
at
last
in
these
words
robert
martin
has
no
great
loss
if
he
can
but
think
so
and
i
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
does
your
views
for
harriet
are
best
known
to
yourself
but
as
you
make
no
secret
of
your
love
of
match
making
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
views
and
plans
and
projects
you
have
and
as
a
friend
i
shall
just
hint
to
you
that
if
elton
is
the
man
i
think
it
will
be
all
labour
in
vain
emma
laughed
and
disclaimed
he
continued
depend
upon
it
elton
will
not
do
elton
is
a
very
good
sort
of
man
and
a
very
respectable
vicar
of
highbury
but
not
at
all
likely
to
make
an
imprudent
match
he
knows
the
value
of
a
good
income
as
well
as
any
body
elton
may
talk
sentimentally
but
he
will
act
rationally
he
is
as
well
acquainted
with
his
own
claims
as
you
can
be
with
harriet
s
he
knows
that
he
is
a
very
handsome
young
man
and
a
great
favourite
wherever
he
goes
and
from
his
general
way
of
talking
in
unreserved
moments
when
there
are
only
men
present
i
am
convinced
that
he
does
not
mean
to
throw
himself
away
i
have
heard
him
speak
with
great
animation
of
a
large
family
of
young
ladies
that
his
sisters
are
intimate
with
who
have
all
twenty
thousand
pounds
apiece
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
emma
laughing
again
if
i
had
set
my
heart
on
mr
elton
s
marrying
harriet
it
would
have
been
very
kind
to
open
my
eyes
but
at
present
i
only
want
to
keep
harriet
to
myself
i
have
done
with
match
making
indeed
i
could
never
hope
to
equal
my
own
doings
at
randalls
i
shall
leave
off
while
i
am
well
good
morning
to
you
said
he
rising
and
walking
off
abruptly
he
was
very
much
vexed
he
felt
the
disappointment
of
the
young
man
and
was
mortified
to
have
been
the
means
of
promoting
it
by
the
sanction
he
had
given
and
the
part
which
he
was
persuaded
emma
had
taken
in
the
affair
was
provoking
him
exceedingly
emma
remained
in
a
state
of
vexation
too
but
there
was
more
indistinctness
in
the
causes
of
her
s
than
in
his
she
did
not
always
feel
so
absolutely
satisfied
with
herself
so
entirely
convinced
that
her
opinions
were
right
and
her
adversary
s
wrong
as
mr
knightley
he
walked
off
in
more
complete
self
approbation
than
he
left
for
her
she
was
not
so
materially
cast
down
however
but
that
a
little
time
and
the
return
of
harriet
were
very
adequate
restoratives
harriet
s
staying
away
so
long
was
beginning
to
make
her
uneasy
the
possibility
of
the
young
man
s
coming
to
mrs
goddard
s
that
morning
and
meeting
with
harriet
and
pleading
his
own
cause
gave
alarming
ideas
the
dread
of
such
a
failure
after
all
became
the
prominent
uneasiness
and
when
harriet
appeared
and
in
very
good
spirits
and
without
having
any
such
reason
to
give
for
her
long
absence
she
felt
a
satisfaction
which
settled
her
with
her
own
mind
and
convinced
her
that
let
mr
knightley
think
or
say
what
he
would
she
had
done
nothing
which
woman
s
friendship
and
woman
s
feelings
would
not
justify
he
had
frightened
her
a
little
about
mr
elton
but
when
she
considered
that
mr
knightley
could
not
have
observed
him
as
she
had
done
neither
with
the
interest
nor
she
must
be
allowed
to
tell
herself
in
spite
of
mr
knightley
s
pretensions
with
the
skill
of
such
an
observer
on
such
a
question
as
herself
that
he
had
spoken
it
hastily
and
in
anger
she
was
able
to
believe
that
he
had
rather
said
what
he
wished
resentfully
to
be
true
than
what
he
knew
any
thing
about
he
certainly
might
have
heard
mr
elton
speak
with
more
unreserve
than
she
had
ever
done
and
mr
elton
might
not
be
of
an
imprudent
inconsiderate
disposition
as
to
money
matters
he
might
naturally
be
rather
attentive
than
otherwise
to
them
but
then
mr
knightley
did
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
influence
of
a
strong
passion
at
war
with
all
interested
motives
mr
knightley
saw
no
such
passion
and
of
course
thought
nothing
of
its
effects
but
she
saw
too
much
of
it
to
feel
a
doubt
of
its
overcoming
any
hesitations
that
a
reasonable
prudence
might
originally
suggest
and
more
than
a
reasonable
becoming
degree
of
prudence
she
was
very
sure
did
not
belong
to
mr
elton
harriet
s
cheerful
look
and
manner
established
hers
she
came
back
not
to
think
of
mr
martin
but
to
talk
of
mr
elton
miss
nash
had
been
telling
her
something
which
she
repeated
immediately
with
great
delight
mr
perry
had
been
to
mrs
goddard
s
to
attend
a
sick
child
and
miss
nash
had
seen
him
and
he
had
told
miss
nash
that
as
he
was
coming
back
yesterday
from
clayton
park
he
had
met
mr
elton
and
found
to
his
great
surprize
that
mr
elton
was
actually
on
his
road
to
london
and
not
meaning
to
return
till
the
morrow
though
it
was
the
whist
club
night
which
he
had
been
never
known
to
miss
before
and
mr
perry
had
remonstrated
with
him
about
it
and
told
him
how
shabby
it
was
in
him
their
best
player
to
absent
himself
and
tried
very
much
to
persuade
him
to
put
off
his
journey
only
one
day
but
it
would
not
do
mr
elton
had
been
determined
to
go
on
and
had
said
in
a
very
particular
way
indeed
that
he
was
going
on
business
which
he
would
not
put
off
for
any
inducement
in
the
world
and
something
about
a
very
enviable
commission
and
being
the
bearer
of
something
exceedingly
precious
mr
perry
could
not
quite
understand
him
but
he
was
very
sure
there
must
be
a
lady
in
the
case
and
he
told
him
so
and
mr
elton
only
looked
very
conscious
and
smiling
and
rode
off
in
great
spirits
miss
nash
had
told
her
all
this
and
had
talked
a
great
deal
more
about
mr
elton
and
said
looking
so
very
significantly
at
her
that
she
did
not
pretend
to
understand
what
his
business
might
be
but
she
only
knew
that
any
woman
whom
mr
elton
could
prefer
she
should
think
the
luckiest
woman
in
the
world
for
beyond
a
doubt
mr
elton
had
not
his
equal
for
beauty
or
agreeableness
chapter
ix
mr
knightley
might
quarrel
with
her
but
emma
could
not
quarrel
with
herself
he
was
so
much
displeased
that
it
was
longer
than
usual
before
he
came
to
hartfield
again
and
when
they
did
meet
his
grave
looks
shewed
that
she
was
not
forgiven
she
was
sorry
but
could
not
repent
on
the
contrary
her
plans
and
proceedings
were
more
and
more
justified
and
endeared
to
her
by
the
general
appearances
of
the
next
few
days
the
picture
elegantly
framed
came
safely
to
hand
soon
after
mr
elton
s
return
and
being
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
of
the
common
sitting
room
he
got
up
to
look
at
it
and
sighed
out
his
half
sentences
of
admiration
just
as
he
ought
and
as
for
harriet
s
feelings
they
were
visibly
forming
themselves
into
as
strong
and
steady
an
attachment
as
her
youth
and
sort
of
mind
admitted
emma
was
soon
perfectly
satisfied
of
mr
martin
s
being
no
otherwise
remembered
than
as
he
furnished
a
contrast
with
mr
elton
of
the
utmost
advantage
to
the
latter
her
views
of
improving
her
little
friend
s
mind
by
a
great
deal
of
useful
reading
and
conversation
had
never
yet
led
to
more
than
a
few
first
chapters
and
the
intention
of
going
on
to
morrow
it
was
much
easier
to
chat
than
to
study
much
pleasanter
to
let
her
imagination
range
and
work
at
harriet
s
fortune
than
to
be
labouring
to
enlarge
her
comprehension
or
exercise
it
on
sober
facts
and
the
only
literary
pursuit
which
engaged
harriet
at
present
the
only
mental
provision
she
was
making
for
the
evening
of
life
was
the
collecting
and
transcribing
all
the
riddles
of
every
sort
that
she
could
meet
with
into
a
thin
quarto
of
hot
pressed
paper
made
up
by
her
friend
and
ornamented
with
ciphers
and
trophies
in
this
age
of
literature
such
collections
on
a
very
grand
scale
are
not
uncommon
miss
nash
head
teacher
at
mrs
goddard
s
had
written
out
at
least
three
hundred
and
harriet
who
had
taken
the
first
hint
of
it
from
her
hoped
with
miss
woodhouse
s
help
to
get
a
great
many
more
emma
assisted
with
her
invention
memory
and
taste
and
as
harriet
wrote
a
very
pretty
hand
it
was
likely
to
be
an
arrangement
of
the
first
order
in
form
as
well
as
quantity
mr
woodhouse
was
almost
as
much
interested
in
the
business
as
the
girls
and
tried
very
often
to
recollect
something
worth
their
putting
in
so
many
clever
riddles
as
there
used
to
be
when
he
was
young
he
wondered
he
could
not
remember
them
but
he
hoped
he
should
in
time
and
it
always
ended
in
kitty
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
his
good
friend
perry
too
whom
he
had
spoken
to
on
the
subject
did
not
at
present
recollect
any
thing
of
the
riddle
kind
but
he
had
desired
perry
to
be
upon
the
watch
and
as
he
went
about
so
much
something
he
thought
might
come
from
that
quarter
it
was
by
no
means
his
daughter
s
wish
that
the
intellects
of
highbury
in
general
should
be
put
under
requisition
mr
elton
was
the
only
one
whose
assistance
she
asked
he
was
invited
to
contribute
any
really
good
enigmas
charades
or
conundrums
that
he
might
recollect
and
she
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
most
intently
at
work
with
his
recollections
and
at
the
same
time
as
she
could
perceive
most
earnestly
careful
that
nothing
ungallant
nothing
that
did
not
breathe
a
compliment
to
the
sex
should
pass
his
lips
they
owed
to
him
their
two
or
three
politest
puzzles
and
the
joy
and
exultation
with
which
at
last
he
recalled
and
rather
sentimentally
recited
that
well
known
charade
my
first
doth
affliction
denote
which
my
second
is
destin
d
to
feel
and
my
whole
is
the
best
antidote
that
affliction
to
soften
and
heal
made
her
quite
sorry
to
acknowledge
that
they
had
transcribed
it
some
pages
ago
already
why
will
not
you
write
one
yourself
for
us
mr
elton
said
she
that
is
the
only
security
for
its
freshness
and
nothing
could
be
easier
to
you
oh
no
he
had
never
written
hardly
ever
any
thing
of
the
kind
in
his
life
the
stupidest
fellow
he
was
afraid
not
even
miss
woodhouse
he
stopt
a
moment
or
miss
smith
could
inspire
him
the
very
next
day
however
produced
some
proof
of
inspiration
he
called
for
a
few
moments
just
to
leave
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
table
containing
as
he
said
a
charade
which
a
friend
of
his
had
addressed
to
a
young
lady
the
object
of
his
admiration
but
which
from
his
manner
emma
was
immediately
convinced
must
be
his
own
i
do
not
offer
it
for
miss
smith
s
collection
said
he
being
my
friend
s
i
have
no
right
to
expose
it
in
any
degree
to
the
public
eye
but
perhaps
you
may
not
dislike
looking
at
it
the
speech
was
more
to
emma
than
to
harriet
which
emma
could
understand
there
was
deep
consciousness
about
him
and
he
found
it
easier
to
meet
her
eye
than
her
friend
s
he
was
gone
the
next
moment
after
another
moment
s
pause
take
it
said
emma
smiling
and
pushing
the
paper
towards
harriet
it
is
for
you
take
your
own
but
harriet
was
in
a
tremor
and
could
not
touch
it
and
emma
never
loth
to
be
first
was
obliged
to
examine
it
herself
to
miss
charade
my
first
displays
the
wealth
and
pomp
of
kings
lords
of
the
earth
their
luxury
and
ease
another

my
second

behold
him
there
the

but
ah
united
what
reverse
we
have
man
s
boasted

and
freedom
all
are
flown
lord
of

he

lovely

thy
ready
wit
the

will
soon
supply
may
its
approval
beam
in
that
soft
eye
she
cast
her
eye
over
it
pondered
caught
the
meaning
read
it
through
again
to
be
quite
certain
and
quite
mistress
of
the
lines
and
then
passing
it
to
harriet
sat
happily
smiling
and
saying
to
herself
while
harriet
was
puzzling
over
the
paper
in
all
the
confusion
of
hope
and
dulness
very
well
mr
elton
very
well
indeed
i
have
read
worse
charades
courtship
a
very
good
hint
i
give
you
credit
for
it
this
is
feeling
your
way
this
is
saying
very
plainly
pray
miss
smith
give
me
leave
to
pay
my
addresses
to
you
approve
my
charade
and
my
intentions
in
the
same
glance
may
its
approval
beam
in
that
soft
eye
harriet
exactly
soft
is
the
very
word
for
her
eye
of
all
epithets
the
justest
that
could
be
given
thy
ready
wit
the
word
will
soon
supply
humph
harriet
s
ready
wit
all
the
better
a
man
must
be
very
much
in
love
indeed
to
describe
her
so
ah
mr
knightley
i
wish
you
had
the
benefit
of
this
i
think
this
would
convince
you
for
once
in
your
life
you
would
be
obliged
to
own
yourself
mistaken
an
excellent
charade
indeed
and
very
much
to
the
purpose
things
must
come
to
a
crisis
soon
now
she
was
obliged
to
break
off
from
these
very
pleasant
observations
which
were
otherwise
of
a
sort
to
run
into
great
length
by
the
eagerness
of
harriet
s
wondering
questions
what
can
it
be
miss
woodhouse
what
can
it
be
i
have
not
an
idea
i
cannot
guess
it
in
the
least
what
can
it
possibly
be
do
try
to
find
it
out
miss
woodhouse
do
help
me
i
never
saw
any
thing
so
hard
is
it
kingdom
i
wonder
who
the
friend
was
and
who
could
be
the
young
lady
do
you
think
it
is
a
good
one
can
it
be
woman
and
woman
lovely
woman
reigns
alone
can
it
be
neptune
behold
him
there
the
monarch
of
the
seas
or
a
trident
or
a
mermaid
or
a
shark
oh
no
shark
is
only
one
syllable
it
must
be
very
clever
or
he
would
not
have
brought
it
oh
miss
woodhouse
do
you
think
we
shall
ever
find
it
out
mermaids
and
sharks
nonsense
my
dear
harriet
what
are
you
thinking
of
where
would
be
the
use
of
his
bringing
us
a
charade
made
by
a
friend
upon
a
mermaid
or
a
shark
give
me
the
paper
and
listen
for
miss
read
miss
smith
my
first
displays
the
wealth
and
pomp
of
kings
lords
of
the
earth
their
luxury
and
ease
that
is
court
another
view
of
man
my
second
brings
behold
him
there
the
monarch
of
the
seas
that
is
ship
plain
as
it
can
be
now
for
the
cream
but
ah
united
courtship
you
know
what
reverse
we
have
man
s
boasted
power
and
freedom
all
are
flown
lord
of
the
earth
and
sea
he
bends
a
slave
and
woman
lovely
woman
reigns
alone
a
very
proper
compliment
and
then
follows
the
application
which
i
think
my
dear
harriet
you
cannot
find
much
difficulty
in
comprehending
read
it
in
comfort
to
yourself
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
being
written
for
you
and
to
you
harriet
could
not
long
resist
so
delightful
a
persuasion
she
read
the
concluding
lines
and
was
all
flutter
and
happiness
she
could
not
speak
but
she
was
not
wanted
to
speak
it
was
enough
for
her
to
feel
emma
spoke
for
her
there
is
so
pointed
and
so
particular
a
meaning
in
this
compliment
said
she
that
i
cannot
have
a
doubt
as
to
mr
elton
s
intentions
you
are
his
object
and
you
will
soon
receive
the
completest
proof
of
it
i
thought
it
must
be
so
i
thought
i
could
not
be
so
deceived
but
now
it
is
clear
the
state
of
his
mind
is
as
clear
and
decided
as
my
wishes
on
the
subject
have
been
ever
since
i
knew
you
yes
harriet
just
so
long
have
i
been
wanting
the
very
circumstance
to
happen
what
has
happened
i
could
never
tell
whether
an
attachment
between
you
and
mr
elton
were
most
desirable
or
most
natural
its
probability
and
its
eligibility
have
really
so
equalled
each
other
i
am
very
happy
i
congratulate
you
my
dear
harriet
with
all
my
heart
this
is
an
attachment
which
a
woman
may
well
feel
pride
in
creating
this
is
a
connexion
which
offers
nothing
but
good
it
will
give
you
every
thing
that
you
want
consideration
independence
a
proper
home
it
will
fix
you
in
the
centre
of
all
your
real
friends
close
to
hartfield
and
to
me
and
confirm
our
intimacy
for
ever
this
harriet
is
an
alliance
which
can
never
raise
a
blush
in
either
of
us
dear
miss
woodhouse
and
dear
miss
woodhouse
was
all
that
harriet
with
many
tender
embraces
could
articulate
at
first
but
when
they
did
arrive
at
something
more
like
conversation
it
was
sufficiently
clear
to
her
friend
that
she
saw
felt
anticipated
and
remembered
just
as
she
ought
mr
elton
s
superiority
had
very
ample
acknowledgment
whatever
you
say
is
always
right
cried
harriet
and
therefore
i
suppose
and
believe
and
hope
it
must
be
so
but
otherwise
i
could
not
have
imagined
it
it
is
so
much
beyond
any
thing
i
deserve
mr
elton
who
might
marry
any
body
there
cannot
be
two
opinions
about
him
he
is
so
very
superior
only
think
of
those
sweet
verses
to
miss
dear
me
how
clever
could
it
really
be
meant
for
me
i
cannot
make
a
question
or
listen
to
a
question
about
that
it
is
a
certainty
receive
it
on
my
judgment
it
is
a
sort
of
prologue
to
the
play
a
motto
to
the
chapter
and
will
be
soon
followed
by
matter
of
fact
prose
it
is
a
sort
of
thing
which
nobody
could
have
expected
i
am
sure
a
month
ago
i
had
no
more
idea
myself
the
strangest
things
do
take
place
when
miss
smiths
and
mr
eltons
get
acquainted
they
do
indeed
and
really
it
is
strange
it
is
out
of
the
common
course
that
what
is
so
evidently
so
palpably
desirable
what
courts
the
pre
arrangement
of
other
people
should
so
immediately
shape
itself
into
the
proper
form
you
and
mr
elton
are
by
situation
called
together
you
belong
to
one
another
by
every
circumstance
of
your
respective
homes
your
marrying
will
be
equal
to
the
match
at
randalls
there
does
seem
to
be
a
something
in
the
air
of
hartfield
which
gives
love
exactly
the
right
direction
and
sends
it
into
the
very
channel
where
it
ought
to
flow
the
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
a
hartfield
edition
of
shakespeare
would
have
a
long
note
on
that
passage
that
mr
elton
should
really
be
in
love
with
me
me
of
all
people
who
did
not
know
him
to
speak
to
him
at
michaelmas
and
he
the
very
handsomest
man
that
ever
was
and
a
man
that
every
body
looks
up
to
quite
like
mr
knightley
his
company
so
sought
after
that
every
body
says
he
need
not
eat
a
single
meal
by
himself
if
he
does
not
chuse
it
that
he
has
more
invitations
than
there
are
days
in
the
week
and
so
excellent
in
the
church
miss
nash
has
put
down
all
the
texts
he
has
ever
preached
from
since
he
came
to
highbury
dear
me
when
i
look
back
to
the
first
time
i
saw
him
how
little
did
i
think
the
two
abbots
and
i
ran
into
the
front
room
and
peeped
through
the
blind
when
we
heard
he
was
going
by
and
miss
nash
came
and
scolded
us
away
and
staid
to
look
through
herself
however
she
called
me
back
presently
and
let
me
look
too
which
was
very
good
natured
and
how
beautiful
we
thought
he
looked
he
was
arm
in
arm
with
mr
cole
this
is
an
alliance
which
whoever
whatever
your
friends
may
be
must
be
agreeable
to
them
provided
at
least
they
have
common
sense
and
we
are
not
to
be
addressing
our
conduct
to
fools
if
they
are
anxious
to
see
you
happily
married
here
is
a
man
whose
amiable
character
gives
every
assurance
of
it
if
they
wish
to
have
you
settled
in
the
same
country
and
circle
which
they
have
chosen
to
place
you
in
here
it
will
be
accomplished
and
if
their
only
object
is
that
you
should
in
the
common
phrase
be
well
married
here
is
the
comfortable
fortune
the
respectable
establishment
the
rise
in
the
world
which
must
satisfy
them
yes
very
true
how
nicely
you
talk
i
love
to
hear
you
you
understand
every
thing
you
and
mr
elton
are
one
as
clever
as
the
other
this
charade
if
i
had
studied
a
twelvemonth
i
could
never
have
made
any
thing
like
it
i
thought
he
meant
to
try
his
skill
by
his
manner
of
declining
it
yesterday
i
do
think
it
is
without
exception
the
best
charade
i
ever
read
i
never
read
one
more
to
the
purpose
certainly
it
is
as
long
again
as
almost
all
we
have
had
before
i
do
not
consider
its
length
as
particularly
in
its
favour
such
things
in
general
cannot
be
too
short
harriet
was
too
intent
on
the
lines
to
hear
the
most
satisfactory
comparisons
were
rising
in
her
mind
it
is
one
thing
said
she
presently
her
cheeks
in
a
glow
to
have
very
good
sense
in
a
common
way
like
every
body
else
and
if
there
is
any
thing
to
say
to
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
and
say
just
what
you
must
in
a
short
way
and
another
to
write
verses
and
charades
like
this
emma
could
not
have
desired
a
more
spirited
rejection
of
mr
martin
s
prose
such
sweet
lines
continued
harriet
these
two
last
but
how
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
return
the
paper
or
say
i
have
found
it
out
oh
miss
woodhouse
what
can
we
do
about
that
leave
it
to
me
you
do
nothing
he
will
be
here
this
evening
i
dare
say
and
then
i
will
give
it
him
back
and
some
nonsense
or
other
will
pass
between
us
and
you
shall
not
be
committed
your
soft
eyes
shall
chuse
their
own
time
for
beaming
trust
to
me
oh
miss
woodhouse
what
a
pity
that
i
must
not
write
this
beautiful
charade
into
my
book
i
am
sure
i
have
not
got
one
half
so
good
leave
out
the
two
last
lines
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
write
it
into
your
book
oh
but
those
two
lines
are
the
best
of
all
granted
for
private
enjoyment
and
for
private
enjoyment
keep
them
they
are
not
at
all
the
less
written
you
know
because
you
divide
them
the
couplet
does
not
cease
to
be
nor
does
its
meaning
change
but
take
it
away
and
all
appropriation
ceases
and
a
very
pretty
gallant
charade
remains
fit
for
any
collection
depend
upon
it
he
would
not
like
to
have
his
charade
slighted
much
better
than
his
passion
a
poet
in
love
must
be
encouraged
in
both
capacities
or
neither
give
me
the
book
i
will
write
it
down
and
then
there
can
be
no
possible
reflection
on
you
harriet
submitted
though
her
mind
could
hardly
separate
the
parts
so
as
to
feel
quite
sure
that
her
friend
were
not
writing
down
a
declaration
of
love
it
seemed
too
precious
an
offering
for
any
degree
of
publicity
i
shall
never
let
that
book
go
out
of
my
own
hands
said
she
very
well
replied
emma
a
most
natural
feeling
and
the
longer
it
lasts
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
but
here
is
my
father
coming
you
will
not
object
to
my
reading
the
charade
to
him
it
will
be
giving
him
so
much
pleasure
he
loves
any
thing
of
the
sort
and
especially
any
thing
that
pays
woman
a
compliment
he
has
the
tenderest
spirit
of
gallantry
towards
us
all
you
must
let
me
read
it
to
him
harriet
looked
grave
my
dear
harriet
you
must
not
refine
too
much
upon
this
charade
you
will
betray
your
feelings
improperly
if
you
are
too
conscious
and
too
quick
and
appear
to
affix
more
meaning
or
even
quite
all
the
meaning
which
may
be
affixed
to
it
do
not
be
overpowered
by
such
a
little
tribute
of
admiration
if
he
had
been
anxious
for
secrecy
he
would
not
have
left
the
paper
while
i
was
by
but
he
rather
pushed
it
towards
me
than
towards
you
do
not
let
us
be
too
solemn
on
the
business
he
has
encouragement
enough
to
proceed
without
our
sighing
out
our
souls
over
this
charade
oh
no
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
ridiculous
about
it
do
as
you
please
mr
woodhouse
came
in
and
very
soon
led
to
the
subject
again
by
the
recurrence
of
his
very
frequent
inquiry
of
well
my
dears
how
does
your
book
go
on
have
you
got
any
thing
fresh
yes
papa
we
have
something
to
read
you
something
quite
fresh
a
piece
of
paper
was
found
on
the
table
this
morning
dropt
we
suppose
by
a
fairy
containing
a
very
pretty
charade
and
we
have
just
copied
it
in
she
read
it
to
him
just
as
he
liked
to
have
any
thing
read
slowly
and
distinctly
and
two
or
three
times
over
with
explanations
of
every
part
as
she
proceeded
and
he
was
very
much
pleased
and
as
she
had
foreseen
especially
struck
with
the
complimentary
conclusion
aye
that
s
very
just
indeed
that
s
very
properly
said
very
true
woman
lovely
woman
it
is
such
a
pretty
charade
my
dear
that
i
can
easily
guess
what
fairy
brought
it
nobody
could
have
written
so
prettily
but
you
emma
emma
only
nodded
and
smiled
after
a
little
thinking
and
a
very
tender
sigh
he
added
ah
it
is
no
difficulty
to
see
who
you
take
after
your
dear
mother
was
so
clever
at
all
those
things
if
i
had
but
her
memory
but
i
can
remember
nothing
not
even
that
particular
riddle
which
you
have
heard
me
mention
i
can
only
recollect
the
first
stanza
and
there
are
several
kitty
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
kindled
a
flame
i
yet
deplore
the
hood
wink
d
boy
i
called
to
aid
though
of
his
near
approach
afraid
so
fatal
to
my
suit
before
and
that
is
all
that
i
can
recollect
of
it
but
it
is
very
clever
all
the
way
through
but
i
think
my
dear
you
said
you
had
got
it
yes
papa
it
is
written
out
in
our
second
page
we
copied
it
from
the
elegant
extracts
it
was
garrick
s
you
know
aye
very
true
i
wish
i
could
recollect
more
of
it
kitty
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
the
name
makes
me
think
of
poor
isabella
for
she
was
very
near
being
christened
catherine
after
her
grandmama
i
hope
we
shall
have
her
here
next
week
have
you
thought
my
dear
where
you
shall
put
her
and
what
room
there
will
be
for
the
children
oh
yes
she
will
have
her
own
room
of
course
the
room
she
always
has
and
there
is
the
nursery
for
the
children
just
as
usual
you
know
why
should
there
be
any
change
i
do
not
know
my
dear
but
it
is
so
long
since
she
was
here
not
since
last
easter
and
then
only
for
a
few
days
mr
john
knightley
s
being
a
lawyer
is
very
inconvenient
poor
isabella
she
is
sadly
taken
away
from
us
all
and
how
sorry
she
will
be
when
she
comes
not
to
see
miss
taylor
here
she
will
not
be
surprized
papa
at
least
i
do
not
know
my
dear
i
am
sure
i
was
very
much
surprized
when
i
first
heard
she
was
going
to
be
married
we
must
ask
mr
and
mrs
weston
to
dine
with
us
while
isabella
is
here
yes
my
dear
if
there
is
time
but
in
a
very
depressed
tone
she
is
coming
for
only
one
week
there
will
not
be
time
for
any
thing
it
is
unfortunate
that
they
cannot
stay
longer
but
it
seems
a
case
of
necessity
mr
john
knightley
must
be
in
town
again
on
the
28th
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful
papa
that
we
are
to
have
the
whole
of
the
time
they
can
give
to
the
country
that
two
or
three
days
are
not
to
be
taken
out
for
the
abbey
mr
knightley
promises
to
give
up
his
claim
this
christmas
though
you
know
it
is
longer
since
they
were
with
him
than
with
us
it
would
be
very
hard
indeed
my
dear
if
poor
isabella
were
to
be
anywhere
but
at
hartfield
mr
woodhouse
could
never
allow
for
mr
knightley
s
claims
on
his
brother
or
any
body
s
claims
on
isabella
except
his
own
he
sat
musing
a
little
while
and
then
said
but
i
do
not
see
why
poor
isabella
should
be
obliged
to
go
back
so
soon
though
he
does
i
think
emma
i
shall
try
and
persuade
her
to
stay
longer
with
us
she
and
the
children
might
stay
very
well
ah
papa
that
is
what
you
never
have
been
able
to
accomplish
and
i
do
not
think
you
ever
will
isabella
cannot
bear
to
stay
behind
her
husband
this
was
too
true
for
contradiction
unwelcome
as
it
was
mr
woodhouse
could
only
give
a
submissive
sigh
and
as
emma
saw
his
spirits
affected
by
the
idea
of
his
daughter
s
attachment
to
her
husband
she
immediately
led
to
such
a
branch
of
the
subject
as
must
raise
them
harriet
must
give
us
as
much
of
her
company
as
she
can
while
my
brother
and
sister
are
here
i
am
sure
she
will
be
pleased
with
the
children
we
are
very
proud
of
the
children
are
not
we
papa
i
wonder
which
she
will
think
the
handsomest
henry
or
john
aye
i
wonder
which
she
will
poor
little
dears
how
glad
they
will
be
to
come
they
are
very
fond
of
being
at
hartfield
harriet
i
dare
say
they
are
sir
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
who
is
not
henry
is
a
fine
boy
but
john
is
very
like
his
mama
henry
is
the
eldest
he
was
named
after
me
not
after
his
father
john
the
second
is
named
after
his
father
some
people
are
surprized
i
believe
that
the
eldest
was
not
but
isabella
would
have
him
called
henry
which
i
thought
very
pretty
of
her
and
he
is
a
very
clever
boy
indeed
they
are
all
remarkably
clever
and
they
have
so
many
pretty
ways
they
will
come
and
stand
by
my
chair
and
say
grandpapa
can
you
give
me
a
bit
of
string
and
once
henry
asked
me
for
a
knife
but
i
told
him
knives
were
only
made
for
grandpapas
i
think
their
father
is
too
rough
with
them
very
often
he
appears
rough
to
you
said
emma
because
you
are
so
very
gentle
yourself
but
if
you
could
compare
him
with
other
papas
you
would
not
think
him
rough
he
wishes
his
boys
to
be
active
and
hardy
and
if
they
misbehave
can
give
them
a
sharp
word
now
and
then
but
he
is
an
affectionate
father
certainly
mr
john
knightley
is
an
affectionate
father
the
children
are
all
fond
of
him
and
then
their
uncle
comes
in
and
tosses
them
up
to
the
ceiling
in
a
very
frightful
way
but
they
like
it
papa
there
is
nothing
they
like
so
much
it
is
such
enjoyment
to
them
that
if
their
uncle
did
not
lay
down
the
rule
of
their
taking
turns
whichever
began
would
never
give
way
to
the
other
well
i
cannot
understand
it
that
is
the
case
with
us
all
papa
one
half
of
the
world
cannot
understand
the
pleasures
of
the
other
later
in
the
morning
and
just
as
the
girls
were
going
to
separate
in
preparation
for
the
regular
four
o
clock
dinner
the
hero
of
this
inimitable
charade
walked
in
again
harriet
turned
away
but
emma
could
receive
him
with
the
usual
smile
and
her
quick
eye
soon
discerned
in
his
the
consciousness
of
having
made
a
push
of
having
thrown
a
die
and
she
imagined
he
was
come
to
see
how
it
might
turn
up
his
ostensible
reason
however
was
to
ask
whether
mr
woodhouse
s
party
could
be
made
up
in
the
evening
without
him
or
whether
he
should
be
in
the
smallest
degree
necessary
at
hartfield
if
he
were
every
thing
else
must
give
way
but
otherwise
his
friend
cole
had
been
saying
so
much
about
his
dining
with
him
had
made
such
a
point
of
it
that
he
had
promised
him
conditionally
to
come
emma
thanked
him
but
could
not
allow
of
his
disappointing
his
friend
on
their
account
her
father
was
sure
of
his
rubber
he
re
urged
she
re
declined
and
he
seemed
then
about
to
make
his
bow
when
taking
the
paper
from
the
table
she
returned
it
oh
here
is
the
charade
you
were
so
obliging
as
to
leave
with
us
thank
you
for
the
sight
of
it
we
admired
it
so
much
that
i
have
ventured
to
write
it
into
miss
smith
s
collection
your
friend
will
not
take
it
amiss
i
hope
of
course
i
have
not
transcribed
beyond
the
first
eight
lines
mr
elton
certainly
did
not
very
well
know
what
to
say
he
looked
rather
doubtingly
rather
confused
said
something
about
honour
glanced
at
emma
and
at
harriet
and
then
seeing
the
book
open
on
the
table
took
it
up
and
examined
it
very
attentively
with
the
view
of
passing
off
an
awkward
moment
emma
smilingly
said
you
must
make
my
apologies
to
your
friend
but
so
good
a
charade
must
not
be
confined
to
one
or
two
he
may
be
sure
of
every
woman
s
approbation
while
he
writes
with
such
gallantry
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
replied
mr
elton
though
hesitating
a
good
deal
while
he
spoke
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
at
least
if
my
friend
feels
at
all
as
i
do
i
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
that
could
he
see
his
little
effusion
honoured
as
i
see
it
looking
at
the
book
again
and
replacing
it
on
the
table
he
would
consider
it
as
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
after
this
speech
he
was
gone
as
soon
as
possible
emma
could
not
think
it
too
soon
for
with
all
his
good
and
agreeable
qualities
there
was
a
sort
of
parade
in
his
speeches
which
was
very
apt
to
incline
her
to
laugh
she
ran
away
to
indulge
the
inclination
leaving
the
tender
and
the
sublime
of
pleasure
to
harriet
s
share
chapter

though
now
the
middle
of
december
there
had
yet
been
no
weather
to
prevent
the
young
ladies
from
tolerably
regular
exercise
and
on
the
morrow
emma
had
a
charitable
visit
to
pay
to
a
poor
sick
family
who
lived
a
little
way
out
of
highbury
their
road
to
this
detached
cottage
was
down
vicarage
lane
a
lane
leading
at
right
angles
from
the
broad
though
irregular
main
street
of
the
place
and
as
may
be
inferred
containing
the
blessed
abode
of
mr
elton
a
few
inferior
dwellings
were
first
to
be
passed
and
then
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
lane
rose
the
vicarage
an
old
and
not
very
good
house
almost
as
close
to
the
road
as
it
could
be
it
had
no
advantage
of
situation
but
had
been
very
much
smartened
up
by
the
present
proprietor
and
such
as
it
was
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
the
two
friends
passing
it
without
a
slackened
pace
and
observing
eyes
emma
s
remark
was
there
it
is
there
go
you
and
your
riddle
book
one
of
these
days
harriet
s
was
oh
what
a
sweet
house
how
very
beautiful
there
are
the
yellow
curtains
that
miss
nash
admires
so
much
i
do
not
often
walk
this
way
now
said
emma
as
they
proceeded
but
then
there
will
be
an
inducement
and
i
shall
gradually
get
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
hedges
gates
pools
and
pollards
of
this
part
of
highbury
harriet
she
found
had
never
in
her
life
been
within
side
the
vicarage
and
her
curiosity
to
see
it
was
so
extreme
that
considering
exteriors
and
probabilities
emma
could
only
class
it
as
a
proof
of
love
with
mr
elton
s
seeing
ready
wit
in
her
i
wish
we
could
contrive
it
said
she
but
i
cannot
think
of
any
tolerable
pretence
for
going
in
no
servant
that
i
want
to
inquire
about
of
his
housekeeper
no
message
from
my
father
she
pondered
but
could
think
of
nothing
after
a
mutual
silence
of
some
minutes
harriet
thus
began
again
i
do
so
wonder
miss
woodhouse
that
you
should
not
be
married
or
going
to
be
married
so
charming
as
you
are
emma
laughed
and
replied
my
being
charming
harriet
is
not
quite
enough
to
induce
me
to
marry
i
must
find
other
people
charming
one
other
person
at
least
and
i
am
not
only
not
going
to
be
married
at
present
but
have
very
little
intention
of
ever
marrying
at
all
ah
so
you
say
but
i
cannot
believe
it
i
must
see
somebody
very
superior
to
any
one
i
have
seen
yet
to
be
tempted
mr
elton
you
know
recollecting
herself
is
out
of
the
question
and
i
do
not
wish
to
see
any
such
person
i
would
rather
not
be
tempted
i
cannot
really
change
for
the
better
if
i
were
to
marry
i
must
expect
to
repent
it
dear
me
it
is
so
odd
to
hear
a
woman
talk
so
i
have
none
of
the
usual
inducements
of
women
to
marry
were
i
to
fall
in
love
indeed
it
would
be
a
different
thing
but
i
never
have
been
in
love
it
is
not
my
way
or
my
nature
and
i
do
not
think
i
ever
shall
and
without
love
i
am
sure
i
should
be
a
fool
to
change
such
a
situation
as
mine
fortune
i
do
not
want
employment
i
do
not
want
consequence
i
do
not
want
i
believe
few
married
women
are
half
as
much
mistress
of
their
husband
s
house
as
i
am
of
hartfield
and
never
never
could
i
expect
to
be
so
truly
beloved
and
important
so
always
first
and
always
right
in
any
man
s
eyes
as
i
am
in
my
father
s
but
then
to
be
an
old
maid
at
last
like
miss
bates
that
is
as
formidable
an
image
as
you
could
present
harriet
and
if
i
thought
i
should
ever
be
like
miss
bates
so
silly
so
satisfied
so
smiling
so
prosing
so
undistinguishing
and
unfastidious
and
so
apt
to
tell
every
thing
relative
to
every
body
about
me
i
would
marry
to
morrow
but
between
us
i
am
convinced
there
never
can
be
any
likeness
except
in
being
unmarried
but
still
you
will
be
an
old
maid
and
that
s
so
dreadful
never
mind
harriet
i
shall
not
be
a
poor
old
maid
and
it
is
poverty
only
which
makes
celibacy
contemptible
to
a
generous
public
a
single
woman
with
a
very
narrow
income
must
be
a
ridiculous
disagreeable
old
maid
the
proper
sport
of
boys
and
girls
but
a
single
woman
of
good
fortune
is
always
respectable
and
may
be
as
sensible
and
pleasant
as
any
body
else
and
the
distinction
is
not
quite
so
much
against
the
candour
and
common
sense
of
the
world
as
appears
at
first
for
a
very
narrow
income
has
a
tendency
to
contract
the
mind
and
sour
the
temper
those
who
can
barely
live
and
who
live
perforce
in
a
very
small
and
generally
very
inferior
society
may
well
be
illiberal
and
cross
this
does
not
apply
however
to
miss
bates
she
is
only
too
good
natured
and
too
silly
to
suit
me
but
in
general
she
is
very
much
to
the
taste
of
every
body
though
single
and
though
poor
poverty
certainly
has
not
contracted
her
mind
i
really
believe
if
she
had
only
a
shilling
in
the
world
she
would
be
very
likely
to
give
away
sixpence
of
it
and
nobody
is
afraid
of
her
that
is
a
great
charm
dear
me
but
what
shall
you
do
how
shall
you
employ
yourself
when
you
grow
old
if
i
know
myself
harriet
mine
is
an
active
busy
mind
with
a
great
many
independent
resources
and
i
do
not
perceive
why
i
should
be
more
in
want
of
employment
at
forty
or
fifty
than
one
and
twenty
woman
s
usual
occupations
of
hand
and
mind
will
be
as
open
to
me
then
as
they
are
now
or
with
no
important
variation
if
i
draw
less
i
shall
read
more
if
i
give
up
music
i
shall
take
to
carpet
work
and
as
for
objects
of
interest
objects
for
the
affections
which
is
in
truth
the
great
point
of
inferiority
the
want
of
which
is
really
the
great
evil
to
be
avoided
in
not
marrying
i
shall
be
very
well
off
with
all
the
children
of
a
sister
i
love
so
much
to
care
about
there
will
be
enough
of
them
in
all
probability
to
supply
every
sort
of
sensation
that
declining
life
can
need
there
will
be
enough
for
every
hope
and
every
fear
and
though
my
attachment
to
none
can
equal
that
of
a
parent
it
suits
my
ideas
of
comfort
better
than
what
is
warmer
and
blinder
my
nephews
and
nieces
i
shall
often
have
a
niece
with
me
do
you
know
miss
bates
s
niece
that
is
i
know
you
must
have
seen
her
a
hundred
times
but
are
you
acquainted
oh
yes
we
are
always
forced
to
be
acquainted
whenever
she
comes
to
highbury
by
the
bye
that
is
almost
enough
to
put
one
out
of
conceit
with
a
niece
heaven
forbid
at
least
that
i
should
ever
bore
people
half
so
much
about
all
the
knightleys
together
as
she
does
about
jane
fairfax
one
is
sick
of
the
very
name
of
jane
fairfax
every
letter
from
her
is
read
forty
times
over
her
compliments
to
all
friends
go
round
and
round
again
and
if
she
does
but
send
her
aunt
the
pattern
of
a
stomacher
or
knit
a
pair
of
garters
for
her
grandmother
one
hears
of
nothing
else
for
a
month
i
wish
jane
fairfax
very
well
but
she
tires
me
to
death
they
were
now
approaching
the
cottage
and
all
idle
topics
were
superseded
emma
was
very
compassionate
and
the
distresses
of
the
poor
were
as
sure
of
relief
from
her
personal
attention
and
kindness
her
counsel
and
her
patience
as
from
her
purse
she
understood
their
ways
could
allow
for
their
ignorance
and
their
temptations
had
no
romantic
expectations
of
extraordinary
virtue
from
those
for
whom
education
had
done
so
little
entered
into
their
troubles
with
ready
sympathy
and
always
gave
her
assistance
with
as
much
intelligence
as
good
will
in
the
present
instance
it
was
sickness
and
poverty
together
which
she
came
to
visit
and
after
remaining
there
as
long
as
she
could
give
comfort
or
advice
she
quitted
the
cottage
with
such
an
impression
of
the
scene
as
made
her
say
to
harriet
as
they
walked
away
these
are
the
sights
harriet
to
do
one
good
how
trifling
they
make
every
thing
else
appear
i
feel
now
as
if
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
these
poor
creatures
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
yet
who
can
say
how
soon
it
may
all
vanish
from
my
mind
very
true
said
harriet
poor
creatures
one
can
think
of
nothing
else
and
really
i
do
not
think
the
impression
will
soon
be
over
said
emma
as
she
crossed
the
low
hedge
and
tottering
footstep
which
ended
the
narrow
slippery
path
through
the
cottage
garden
and
brought
them
into
the
lane
again
i
do
not
think
it
will
stopping
to
look
once
more
at
all
the
outward
wretchedness
of
the
place
and
recall
the
still
greater
within
oh
dear
no
said
her
companion
they
walked
on
the
lane
made
a
slight
bend
and
when
that
bend
was
passed
mr
elton
was
immediately
in
sight
and
so
near
as
to
give
emma
time
only
to
say
farther
ah
harriet
here
comes
a
very
sudden
trial
of
our
stability
in
good
thoughts
well
smiling
i
hope
it
may
be
allowed
that
if
compassion
has
produced
exertion
and
relief
to
the
sufferers
it
has
done
all
that
is
truly
important
if
we
feel
for
the
wretched
enough
to
do
all
we
can
for
them
the
rest
is
empty
sympathy
only
distressing
to
ourselves
harriet
could
just
answer
oh
dear
yes
before
the
gentleman
joined
them
the
wants
and
sufferings
of
the
poor
family
however
were
the
first
subject
on
meeting
he
had
been
going
to
call
on
them
his
visit
he
would
now
defer
but
they
had
a
very
interesting
parley
about
what
could
be
done
and
should
be
done
mr
elton
then
turned
back
to
accompany
them
to
fall
in
with
each
other
on
such
an
errand
as
this
thought
emma
to
meet
in
a
charitable
scheme
this
will
bring
a
great
increase
of
love
on
each
side
i
should
not
wonder
if
it
were
to
bring
on
the
declaration
it
must
if
i
were
not
here
i
wish
i
were
anywhere
else
anxious
to
separate
herself
from
them
as
far
as
she
could
she
soon
afterwards
took
possession
of
a
narrow
footpath
a
little
raised
on
one
side
of
the
lane
leaving
them
together
in
the
main
road
but
she
had
not
been
there
two
minutes
when
she
found
that
harriet
s
habits
of
dependence
and
imitation
were
bringing
her
up
too
and
that
in
short
they
would
both
be
soon
after
her
this
would
not
do
she
immediately
stopped
under
pretence
of
having
some
alteration
to
make
in
the
lacing
of
her
half
boot
and
stooping
down
in
complete
occupation
of
the
footpath
begged
them
to
have
the
goodness
to
walk
on
and
she
would
follow
in
half
a
minute
they
did
as
they
were
desired
and
by
the
time
she
judged
it
reasonable
to
have
done
with
her
boot
she
had
the
comfort
of
farther
delay
in
her
power
being
overtaken
by
a
child
from
the
cottage
setting
out
according
to
orders
with
her
pitcher
to
fetch
broth
from
hartfield
to
walk
by
the
side
of
this
child
and
talk
to
and
question
her
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
or
would
have
been
the
most
natural
had
she
been
acting
just
then
without
design
and
by
this
means
the
others
were
still
able
to
keep
ahead
without
any
obligation
of
waiting
for
her
she
gained
on
them
however
involuntarily
the
child
s
pace
was
quick
and
theirs
rather
slow
and
she
was
the
more
concerned
at
it
from
their
being
evidently
in
a
conversation
which
interested
them
mr
elton
was
speaking
with
animation
harriet
listening
with
a
very
pleased
attention
and
emma
having
sent
the
child
on
was
beginning
to
think
how
she
might
draw
back
a
little
more
when
they
both
looked
around
and
she
was
obliged
to
join
them
mr
elton
was
still
talking
still
engaged
in
some
interesting
detail
and
emma
experienced
some
disappointment
when
she
found
that
he
was
only
giving
his
fair
companion
an
account
of
the
yesterday
s
party
at
his
friend
cole
s
and
that
she
was
come
in
herself
for
the
stilton
cheese
the
north
wiltshire
the
butter
the
celery
the
beet
root
and
all
the
dessert
this
would
soon
have
led
to
something
better
of
course
was
her
consoling
reflection
any
thing
interests
between
those
who
love
and
any
thing
will
serve
as
introduction
to
what
is
near
the
heart
if
i
could
but
have
kept
longer
away
they
now
walked
on
together
quietly
till
within
view
of
the
vicarage
pales
when
a
sudden
resolution
of
at
least
getting
harriet
into
the
house
made
her
again
find
something
very
much
amiss
about
her
boot
and
fall
behind
to
arrange
it
once
more
she
then
broke
the
lace
off
short
and
dexterously
throwing
it
into
a
ditch
was
presently
obliged
to
entreat
them
to
stop
and
acknowledged
her
inability
to
put
herself
to
rights
so
as
to
be
able
to
walk
home
in
tolerable
comfort
part
of
my
lace
is
gone
said
she
and
i
do
not
know
how
i
am
to
contrive
i
really
am
a
most
troublesome
companion
to
you
both
but
i
hope
i
am
not
often
so
ill
equipped
mr
elton
i
must
beg
leave
to
stop
at
your
house
and
ask
your
housekeeper
for
a
bit
of
ribband
or
string
or
any
thing
just
to
keep
my
boot
on
mr
elton
looked
all
happiness
at
this
proposition
and
nothing
could
exceed
his
alertness
and
attention
in
conducting
them
into
his
house
and
endeavouring
to
make
every
thing
appear
to
advantage
the
room
they
were
taken
into
was
the
one
he
chiefly
occupied
and
looking
forwards
behind
it
was
another
with
which
it
immediately
communicated
the
door
between
them
was
open
and
emma
passed
into
it
with
the
housekeeper
to
receive
her
assistance
in
the
most
comfortable
manner
she
was
obliged
to
leave
the
door
ajar
as
she
found
it
but
she
fully
intended
that
mr
elton
should
close
it
it
was
not
closed
however
it
still
remained
ajar
but
by
engaging
the
housekeeper
in
incessant
conversation
she
hoped
to
make
it
practicable
for
him
to
chuse
his
own
subject
in
the
adjoining
room
for
ten
minutes
she
could
hear
nothing
but
herself
it
could
be
protracted
no
longer
she
was
then
obliged
to
be
finished
and
make
her
appearance
the
lovers
were
standing
together
at
one
of
the
windows
it
had
a
most
favourable
aspect
and
for
half
a
minute
emma
felt
the
glory
of
having
schemed
successfully
but
it
would
not
do
he
had
not
come
to
the
point
he
had
been
most
agreeable
most
delightful
he
had
told
harriet
that
he
had
seen
them
go
by
and
had
purposely
followed
them
other
little
gallantries
and
allusions
had
been
dropt
but
nothing
serious
cautious
very
cautious
thought
emma
he
advances
inch
by
inch
and
will
hazard
nothing
till
he
believes
himself
secure
still
however
though
every
thing
had
not
been
accomplished
by
her
ingenious
device
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
it
had
been
the
occasion
of
much
present
enjoyment
to
both
and
must
be
leading
them
forward
to
the
great
event
chapter
xi
mr
elton
must
now
be
left
to
himself
it
was
no
longer
in
emma
s
power
to
superintend
his
happiness
or
quicken
his
measures
the
coming
of
her
sister
s
family
was
so
very
near
at
hand
that
first
in
anticipation
and
then
in
reality
it
became
henceforth
her
prime
object
of
interest
and
during
the
ten
days
of
their
stay
at
hartfield
it
was
not
to
be
expected
she
did
not
herself
expect
that
any
thing
beyond
occasional
fortuitous
assistance
could
be
afforded
by
her
to
the
lovers
they
might
advance
rapidly
if
they
would
however
they
must
advance
somehow
or
other
whether
they
would
or
no
she
hardly
wished
to
have
more
leisure
for
them
there
are
people
who
the
more
you
do
for
them
the
less
they
will
do
for
themselves
mr
and
mrs
john
knightley
from
having
been
longer
than
usual
absent
from
surry
were
exciting
of
course
rather
more
than
the
usual
interest
till
this
year
every
long
vacation
since
their
marriage
had
been
divided
between
hartfield
and
donwell
abbey
but
all
the
holidays
of
this
autumn
had
been
given
to
sea
bathing
for
the
children
and
it
was
therefore
many
months
since
they
had
been
seen
in
a
regular
way
by
their
surry
connexions
or
seen
at
all
by
mr
woodhouse
who
could
not
be
induced
to
get
so
far
as
london
even
for
poor
isabella
s
sake
and
who
consequently
was
now
most
nervously
and
apprehensively
happy
in
forestalling
this
too
short
visit
he
thought
much
of
the
evils
of
the
journey
for
her
and
not
a
little
of
the
fatigues
of
his
own
horses
and
coachman
who
were
to
bring
some
of
the
party
the
last
half
of
the
way
but
his
alarms
were
needless
the
sixteen
miles
being
happily
accomplished
and
mr
and
mrs
john
knightley
their
five
children
and
a
competent
number
of
nursery
maids
all
reaching
hartfield
in
safety
the
bustle
and
joy
of
such
an
arrival
the
many
to
be
talked
to
welcomed
encouraged
and
variously
dispersed
and
disposed
of
produced
a
noise
and
confusion
which
his
nerves
could
not
have
borne
under
any
other
cause
nor
have
endured
much
longer
even
for
this
but
the
ways
of
hartfield
and
the
feelings
of
her
father
were
so
respected
by
mrs
john
knightley
that
in
spite
of
maternal
solicitude
for
the
immediate
enjoyment
of
her
little
ones
and
for
their
having
instantly
all
the
liberty
and
attendance
all
the
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
and
playing
which
they
could
possibly
wish
for
without
the
smallest
delay
the
children
were
never
allowed
to
be
long
a
disturbance
to
him
either
in
themselves
or
in
any
restless
attendance
on
them
mrs
john
knightley
was
a
pretty
elegant
little
woman
of
gentle
quiet
manners
and
a
disposition
remarkably
amiable
and
affectionate
wrapt
up
in
her
family
a
devoted
wife
a
doating
mother
and
so
tenderly
attached
to
her
father
and
sister
that
but
for
these
higher
ties
a
warmer
love
might
have
seemed
impossible
she
could
never
see
a
fault
in
any
of
them
she
was
not
a
woman
of
strong
understanding
or
any
quickness
and
with
this
resemblance
of
her
father
she
inherited
also
much
of
his
constitution
was
delicate
in
her
own
health
over
careful
of
that
of
her
children
had
many
fears
and
many
nerves
and
was
as
fond
of
her
own
mr
wingfield
in
town
as
her
father
could
be
of
mr
perry
they
were
alike
too
in
a
general
benevolence
of
temper
and
a
strong
habit
of
regard
for
every
old
acquaintance
mr
john
knightley
was
a
tall
gentleman
like
and
very
clever
man
rising
in
his
profession
domestic
and
respectable
in
his
private
character
but
with
reserved
manners
which
prevented
his
being
generally
pleasing
and
capable
of
being
sometimes
out
of
humour
he
was
not
an
ill
tempered
man
not
so
often
unreasonably
cross
as
to
deserve
such
a
reproach
but
his
temper
was
not
his
great
perfection
and
indeed
with
such
a
worshipping
wife
it
was
hardly
possible
that
any
natural
defects
in
it
should
not
be
increased
the
extreme
sweetness
of
her
temper
must
hurt
his
he
had
all
the
clearness
and
quickness
of
mind
which
she
wanted
and
he
could
sometimes
act
an
ungracious
or
say
a
severe
thing
he
was
not
a
great
favourite
with
his
fair
sister
in
law
nothing
wrong
in
him
escaped
her
she
was
quick
in
feeling
the
little
injuries
to
isabella
which
isabella
never
felt
herself
perhaps
she
might
have
passed
over
more
had
his
manners
been
flattering
to
isabella
s
sister
but
they
were
only
those
of
a
calmly
kind
brother
and
friend
without
praise
and
without
blindness
but
hardly
any
degree
of
personal
compliment
could
have
made
her
regardless
of
that
greatest
fault
of
all
in
her
eyes
which
he
sometimes
fell
into
the
want
of
respectful
forbearance
towards
her
father
there
he
had
not
always
the
patience
that
could
have
been
wished
mr
woodhouse
s
peculiarities
and
fidgetiness
were
sometimes
provoking
him
to
a
rational
remonstrance
or
sharp
retort
equally
ill
bestowed
it
did
not
often
happen
for
mr
john
knightley
had
really
a
great
regard
for
his
father
in
law
and
generally
a
strong
sense
of
what
was
due
to
him
but
it
was
too
often
for
emma
s
charity
especially
as
there
was
all
the
pain
of
apprehension
frequently
to
be
endured
though
the
offence
came
not
the
beginning
however
of
every
visit
displayed
none
but
the
properest
feelings
and
this
being
of
necessity
so
short
might
be
hoped
to
pass
away
in
unsullied
cordiality
they
had
not
been
long
seated
and
composed
when
mr
woodhouse
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
and
a
sigh
called
his
daughter
s
attention
to
the
sad
change
at
hartfield
since
she
had
been
there
last
ah
my
dear
said
he
poor
miss
taylor
it
is
a
grievous
business
oh
yes
sir
cried
she
with
ready
sympathy
how
you
must
miss
her
and
dear
emma
too
what
a
dreadful
loss
to
you
both
i
have
been
so
grieved
for
you
i
could
not
imagine
how
you
could
possibly
do
without
her
it
is
a
sad
change
indeed
but
i
hope
she
is
pretty
well
sir
pretty
well
my
dear
i
hope
pretty
well
i
do
not
know
but
that
the
place
agrees
with
her
tolerably
mr
john
knightley
here
asked
emma
quietly
whether
there
were
any
doubts
of
the
air
of
randalls
oh
no
none
in
the
least
i
never
saw
mrs
weston
better
in
my
life
never
looking
so
well
papa
is
only
speaking
his
own
regret
very
much
to
the
honour
of
both
was
the
handsome
reply
and
do
you
see
her
sir
tolerably
often
asked
isabella
in
the
plaintive
tone
which
just
suited
her
father
mr
woodhouse
hesitated
not
near
so
often
my
dear
as
i
could
wish
oh
papa
we
have
missed
seeing
them
but
one
entire
day
since
they
married
either
in
the
morning
or
evening
of
every
day
excepting
one
have
we
seen
either
mr
weston
or
mrs
weston
and
generally
both
either
at
randalls
or
here
and
as
you
may
suppose
isabella
most
frequently
here
they
are
very
very
kind
in
their
visits
mr
weston
is
really
as
kind
as
herself
papa
if
you
speak
in
that
melancholy
way
you
will
be
giving
isabella
a
false
idea
of
us
all
every
body
must
be
aware
that
miss
taylor
must
be
missed
but
every
body
ought
also
to
be
assured
that
mr
and
mrs
weston
do
really
prevent
our
missing
her
by
any
means
to
the
extent
we
ourselves
anticipated
which
is
the
exact
truth
just
as
it
should
be
said
mr
john
knightley
and
just
as
i
hoped
it
was
from
your
letters
her
wish
of
shewing
you
attention
could
not
be
doubted
and
his
being
a
disengaged
and
social
man
makes
it
all
easy
i
have
been
always
telling
you
my
love
that
i
had
no
idea
of
the
change
being
so
very
material
to
hartfield
as
you
apprehended
and
now
you
have
emma
s
account
i
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
why
to
be
sure
said
mr
woodhouse
yes
certainly
i
cannot
deny
that
mrs
weston
poor
mrs
weston
does
come
and
see
us
pretty
often
but
then
she
is
always
obliged
to
go
away
again
it
would
be
very
hard
upon
mr
weston
if
she
did
not
papa
you
quite
forget
poor
mr
weston
i
think
indeed
said
john
knightley
pleasantly
that
mr
weston
has
some
little
claim
you
and
i
emma
will
venture
to
take
the
part
of
the
poor
husband
i
being
a
husband
and
you
not
being
a
wife
the
claims
of
the
man
may
very
likely
strike
us
with
equal
force
as
for
isabella
she
has
been
married
long
enough
to
see
the
convenience
of
putting
all
the
mr
westons
aside
as
much
as
she
can
me
my
love
cried
his
wife
hearing
and
understanding
only
in
part
are
you
talking
about
me
i
am
sure
nobody
ought
to
be
or
can
be
a
greater
advocate
for
matrimony
than
i
am
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
misery
of
her
leaving
hartfield
i
should
never
have
thought
of
miss
taylor
but
as
the
most
fortunate
woman
in
the
world
and
as
to
slighting
mr
weston
that
excellent
mr
weston
i
think
there
is
nothing
he
does
not
deserve
i
believe
he
is
one
of
the
very
best
tempered
men
that
ever
existed
excepting
yourself
and
your
brother
i
do
not
know
his
equal
for
temper
i
shall
never
forget
his
flying
henry
s
kite
for
him
that
very
windy
day
last
easter
and
ever
since
his
particular
kindness
last
september
twelvemonth
in
writing
that
note
at
twelve
o
clock
at
night
on
purpose
to
assure
me
that
there
was
no
scarlet
fever
at
cobham
i
have
been
convinced
there
could
not
be
a
more
feeling
heart
nor
a
better
man
in
existence
if
any
body
can
deserve
him
it
must
be
miss
taylor
where
is
the
young
man
said
john
knightley
has
he
been
here
on
this
occasion
or
has
he
not
he
has
not
been
here
yet
replied
emma
there
was
a
strong
expectation
of
his
coming
soon
after
the
marriage
but
it
ended
in
nothing
and
i
have
not
heard
him
mentioned
lately
but
you
should
tell
them
of
the
letter
my
dear
said
her
father
he
wrote
a
letter
to
poor
mrs
weston
to
congratulate
her
and
a
very
proper
handsome
letter
it
was
she
shewed
it
to
me
i
thought
it
very
well
done
of
him
indeed
whether
it
was
his
own
idea
you
know
one
cannot
tell
he
is
but
young
and
his
uncle
perhaps
my
dear
papa
he
is
three
and
twenty
you
forget
how
time
passes
three
and
twenty
is
he
indeed
well
i
could
not
have
thought
it
and
he
was
but
two
years
old
when
he
lost
his
poor
mother
well
time
does
fly
indeed
and
my
memory
is
very
bad
however
it
was
an
exceeding
good
pretty
letter
and
gave
mr
and
mrs
weston
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
i
remember
it
was
written
from
weymouth
and
dated
sept
28th
and
began
my
dear
madam
but
i
forget
how
it
went
on
and
it
was
signed
f
c
weston
churchill
i
remember
that
perfectly
how
very
pleasing
and
proper
of
him
cried
the
good
hearted
mrs
john
knightley
i
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
most
amiable
young
man
but
how
sad
it
is
that
he
should
not
live
at
home
with
his
father
there
is
something
so
shocking
in
a
child
s
being
taken
away
from
his
parents
and
natural
home
i
never
could
comprehend
how
mr
weston
could
part
with
him
to
give
up
one
s
child
i
really
never
could
think
well
of
any
body
who
proposed
such
a
thing
to
any
body
else
nobody
ever
did
think
well
of
the
churchills
i
fancy
observed
mr
john
knightley
coolly
but
you
need
not
imagine
mr
weston
to
have
felt
what
you
would
feel
in
giving
up
henry
or
john
mr
weston
is
rather
an
easy
cheerful
tempered
man
than
a
man
of
strong
feelings
he
takes
things
as
he
finds
them
and
makes
enjoyment
of
them
somehow
or
other
depending
i
suspect
much
more
upon
what
is
called
society
for
his
comforts
that
is
upon
the
power
of
eating
and
drinking
and
playing
whist
with
his
neighbours
five
times
a
week
than
upon
family
affection
or
any
thing
that
home
affords
emma
could
not
like
what
bordered
on
a
reflection
on
mr
weston
and
had
half
a
mind
to
take
it
up
but
she
struggled
and
let
it
pass
she
would
keep
the
peace
if
possible
and
there
was
something
honourable
and
valuable
in
the
strong
domestic
habits
the
all
sufficiency
of
home
to
himself
whence
resulted
her
brother
s
disposition
to
look
down
on
the
common
rate
of
social
intercourse
and
those
to
whom
it
was
important
it
had
a
high
claim
to
forbearance
chapter
xii
mr
knightley
was
to
dine
with
them
rather
against
the
inclination
of
mr
woodhouse
who
did
not
like
that
any
one
should
share
with
him
in
isabella
s
first
day
emma
s
sense
of
right
however
had
decided
it
and
besides
the
consideration
of
what
was
due
to
each
brother
she
had
particular
pleasure
from
the
circumstance
of
the
late
disagreement
between
mr
knightley
and
herself
in
procuring
him
the
proper
invitation
she
hoped
they
might
now
become
friends
again
she
thought
it
was
time
to
make
up
making
up
indeed
would
not
do
she
certainly
had
not
been
in
the
wrong
and
he
would
never
own
that
he
had
concession
must
be
out
of
the
question
but
it
was
time
to
appear
to
forget
that
they
had
ever
quarrelled
and
she
hoped
it
might
rather
assist
the
restoration
of
friendship
that
when
he
came
into
the
room
she
had
one
of
the
children
with
her
the
youngest
a
nice
little
girl
about
eight
months
old
who
was
now
making
her
first
visit
to
hartfield
and
very
happy
to
be
danced
about
in
her
aunt
s
arms
it
did
assist
for
though
he
began
with
grave
looks
and
short
questions
he
was
soon
led
on
to
talk
of
them
all
in
the
usual
way
and
to
take
the
child
out
of
her
arms
with
all
the
unceremoniousness
of
perfect
amity
emma
felt
they
were
friends
again
and
the
conviction
giving
her
at
first
great
satisfaction
and
then
a
little
sauciness
she
could
not
help
saying
as
he
was
admiring
the
baby
what
a
comfort
it
is
that
we
think
alike
about
our
nephews
and
nieces
as
to
men
and
women
our
opinions
are
sometimes
very
different
but
with
regard
to
these
children
i
observe
we
never
disagree
if
you
were
as
much
guided
by
nature
in
your
estimate
of
men
and
women
and
as
little
under
the
power
of
fancy
and
whim
in
your
dealings
with
them
as
you
are
where
these
children
are
concerned
we
might
always
think
alike
to
be
sure
our
discordancies
must
always
arise
from
my
being
in
the
wrong
yes
said
he
smiling
and
reason
good
i
was
sixteen
years
old
when
you
were
born
a
material
difference
then
she
replied
and
no
doubt
you
were
much
my
superior
in
judgment
at
that
period
of
our
lives
but
does
not
the
lapse
of
one
and
twenty
years
bring
our
understandings
a
good
deal
nearer
yes
a
good
deal
nearer
but
still
not
near
enough
to
give
me
a
chance
of
being
right
if
we
think
differently
i
have
still
the
advantage
of
you
by
sixteen
years
experience
and
by
not
being
a
pretty
young
woman
and
a
spoiled
child
come
my
dear
emma
let
us
be
friends
and
say
no
more
about
it
tell
your
aunt
little
emma
that
she
ought
to
set
you
a
better
example
than
to
be
renewing
old
grievances
and
that
if
she
were
not
wrong
before
she
is
now
that
s
true
she
cried
very
true
little
emma
grow
up
a
better
woman
than
your
aunt
be
infinitely
cleverer
and
not
half
so
conceited
now
mr
knightley
a
word
or
two
more
and
i
have
done
as
far
as
good
intentions
went
we
were
both
right
and
i
must
say
that
no
effects
on
my
side
of
the
argument
have
yet
proved
wrong
i
only
want
to
know
that
mr
martin
is
not
very
very
bitterly
disappointed
a
man
cannot
be
more
so
was
his
short
full
answer
ah
indeed
i
am
very
sorry
come
shake
hands
with
me
this
had
just
taken
place
and
with
great
cordiality
when
john
knightley
made
his
appearance
and
how
d
ye
do
george
and
john
how
are
you
succeeded
in
the
true
english
style
burying
under
a
calmness
that
seemed
all
but
indifference
the
real
attachment
which
would
have
led
either
of
them
if
requisite
to
do
every
thing
for
the
good
of
the
other
the
evening
was
quiet
and
conversable
as
mr
woodhouse
declined
cards
entirely
for
the
sake
of
comfortable
talk
with
his
dear
isabella
and
the
little
party
made
two
natural
divisions
on
one
side
he
and
his
daughter
on
the
other
the
two
mr
knightleys
their
subjects
totally
distinct
or
very
rarely
mixing
and
emma
only
occasionally
joining
in
one
or
the
other
the
brothers
talked
of
their
own
concerns
and
pursuits
but
principally
of
those
of
the
elder
whose
temper
was
by
much
the
most
communicative
and
who
was
always
the
greater
talker
as
a
magistrate
he
had
generally
some
point
of
law
to
consult
john
about
or
at
least
some
curious
anecdote
to
give
and
as
a
farmer
as
keeping
in
hand
the
home
farm
at
donwell
he
had
to
tell
what
every
field
was
to
bear
next
year
and
to
give
all
such
local
information
as
could
not
fail
of
being
interesting
to
a
brother
whose
home
it
had
equally
been
the
longest
part
of
his
life
and
whose
attachments
were
strong
the
plan
of
a
drain
the
change
of
a
fence
the
felling
of
a
tree
and
the
destination
of
every
acre
for
wheat
turnips
or
spring
corn
was
entered
into
with
as
much
equality
of
interest
by
john
as
his
cooler
manners
rendered
possible
and
if
his
willing
brother
ever
left
him
any
thing
to
inquire
about
his
inquiries
even
approached
a
tone
of
eagerness
while
they
were
thus
comfortably
occupied
mr
woodhouse
was
enjoying
a
full
flow
of
happy
regrets
and
fearful
affection
with
his
daughter
my
poor
dear
isabella
said
he
fondly
taking
her
hand
and
interrupting
for
a
few
moments
her
busy
labours
for
some
one
of
her
five
children
how
long
it
is
how
terribly
long
since
you
were
here
and
how
tired
you
must
be
after
your
journey
you
must
go
to
bed
early
my
dear
and
i
recommend
a
little
gruel
to
you
before
you
go
you
and
i
will
have
a
nice
basin
of
gruel
together
my
dear
emma
suppose
we
all
have
a
little
gruel
emma
could
not
suppose
any
such
thing
knowing
as
she
did
that
both
the
mr
knightleys
were
as
unpersuadable
on
that
article
as
herself
and
two
basins
only
were
ordered
after
a
little
more
discourse
in
praise
of
gruel
with
some
wondering
at
its
not
being
taken
every
evening
by
every
body
he
proceeded
to
say
with
an
air
of
grave
reflection
it
was
an
awkward
business
my
dear
your
spending
the
autumn
at
south
end
instead
of
coming
here
i
never
had
much
opinion
of
the
sea
air
mr
wingfield
most
strenuously
recommended
it
sir
or
we
should
not
have
gone
he
recommended
it
for
all
the
children
but
particularly
for
the
weakness
in
little
bella
s
throat
both
sea
air
and
bathing
ah
my
dear
but
perry
had
many
doubts
about
the
sea
doing
her
any
good
and
as
to
myself
i
have
been
long
perfectly
convinced
though
perhaps
i
never
told
you
so
before
that
the
sea
is
very
rarely
of
use
to
any
body
i
am
sure
it
almost
killed
me
once
come
come
cried
emma
feeling
this
to
be
an
unsafe
subject
i
must
beg
you
not
to
talk
of
the
sea
it
makes
me
envious
and
miserable
i
who
have
never
seen
it
south
end
is
prohibited
if
you
please
my
dear
isabella
i
have
not
heard
you
make
one
inquiry
about
mr
perry
yet
and
he
never
forgets
you
oh
good
mr
perry
how
is
he
sir
why
pretty
well
but
not
quite
well
poor
perry
is
bilious
and
he
has
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
he
tells
me
he
has
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
which
is
very
sad
but
he
is
always
wanted
all
round
the
country
i
suppose
there
is
not
a
man
in
such
practice
anywhere
but
then
there
is
not
so
clever
a
man
any
where
and
mrs
perry
and
the
children
how
are
they
do
the
children
grow
i
have
a
great
regard
for
mr
perry
i
hope
he
will
be
calling
soon
he
will
be
so
pleased
to
see
my
little
ones
i
hope
he
will
be
here
to
morrow
for
i
have
a
question
or
two
to
ask
him
about
myself
of
some
consequence
and
my
dear
whenever
he
comes
you
had
better
let
him
look
at
little
bella
s
throat
oh
my
dear
sir
her
throat
is
so
much
better
that
i
have
hardly
any
uneasiness
about
it
either
bathing
has
been
of
the
greatest
service
to
her
or
else
it
is
to
be
attributed
to
an
excellent
embrocation
of
mr
wingfield
s
which
we
have
been
applying
at
times
ever
since
august
it
is
not
very
likely
my
dear
that
bathing
should
have
been
of
use
to
her
and
if
i
had
known
you
were
wanting
an
embrocation
i
would
have
spoken
to
you
seem
to
me
to
have
forgotten
mrs
and
miss
bates
said
emma
i
have
not
heard
one
inquiry
after
them
oh
the
good
bateses
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
myself
but
you
mention
them
in
most
of
your
letters
i
hope
they
are
quite
well
good
old
mrs
bates
i
will
call
upon
her
to
morrow
and
take
my
children
they
are
always
so
pleased
to
see
my
children
and
that
excellent
miss
bates
such
thorough
worthy
people
how
are
they
sir
why
pretty
well
my
dear
upon
the
whole
but
poor
mrs
bates
had
a
bad
cold
about
a
month
ago
how
sorry
i
am
but
colds
were
never
so
prevalent
as
they
have
been
this
autumn
mr
wingfield
told
me
that
he
has
never
known
them
more
general
or
heavy
except
when
it
has
been
quite
an
influenza
that
has
been
a
good
deal
the
case
my
dear
but
not
to
the
degree
you
mention
perry
says
that
colds
have
been
very
general
but
not
so
heavy
as
he
has
very
often
known
them
in
november
perry
does
not
call
it
altogether
a
sickly
season
no
i
do
not
know
that
mr
wingfield
considers
it
very
sickly
except
ah
my
poor
dear
child
the
truth
is
that
in
london
it
is
always
a
sickly
season
nobody
is
healthy
in
london
nobody
can
be
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
you
forced
to
live
there
so
far
off
and
the
air
so
bad
no
indeed
we
are
not
at
all
in
a
bad
air
our
part
of
london
is
very
superior
to
most
others
you
must
not
confound
us
with
london
in
general
my
dear
sir
the
neighbourhood
of
brunswick
square
is
very
different
from
almost
all
the
rest
we
are
so
very
airy
i
should
be
unwilling
i
own
to
live
in
any
other
part
of
the
town
there
is
hardly
any
other
that
i
could
be
satisfied
to
have
my
children
in
but
we
are
so
remarkably
airy
mr
wingfield
thinks
the
vicinity
of
brunswick
square
decidedly
the
most
favourable
as
to
air
ah
my
dear
it
is
not
like
hartfield
you
make
the
best
of
it
but
after
you
have
been
a
week
at
hartfield
you
are
all
of
you
different
creatures
you
do
not
look
like
the
same
now
i
cannot
say
that
i
think
you
are
any
of
you
looking
well
at
present
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
sir
but
i
assure
you
excepting
those
little
nervous
head
aches
and
palpitations
which
i
am
never
entirely
free
from
anywhere
i
am
quite
well
myself
and
if
the
children
were
rather
pale
before
they
went
to
bed
it
was
only
because
they
were
a
little
more
tired
than
usual
from
their
journey
and
the
happiness
of
coming
i
hope
you
will
think
better
of
their
looks
to
morrow
for
i
assure
you
mr
wingfield
told
me
that
he
did
not
believe
he
had
ever
sent
us
off
altogether
in
such
good
case
i
trust
at
least
that
you
do
not
think
mr
knightley
looking
ill
turning
her
eyes
with
affectionate
anxiety
towards
her
husband
middling
my
dear
i
cannot
compliment
you
i
think
mr
john
knightley
very
far
from
looking
well
what
is
the
matter
sir
did
you
speak
to
me
cried
mr
john
knightley
hearing
his
own
name
i
am
sorry
to
find
my
love
that
my
father
does
not
think
you
looking
well
but
i
hope
it
is
only
from
being
a
little
fatigued
i
could
have
wished
however
as
you
know
that
you
had
seen
mr
wingfield
before
you
left
home
my
dear
isabella
exclaimed
he
hastily
pray
do
not
concern
yourself
about
my
looks
be
satisfied
with
doctoring
and
coddling
yourself
and
the
children
and
let
me
look
as
i
chuse
i
did
not
thoroughly
understand
what
you
were
telling
your
brother
cried
emma
about
your
friend
mr
graham
s
intending
to
have
a
bailiff
from
scotland
to
look
after
his
new
estate
what
will
it
answer
will
not
the
old
prejudice
be
too
strong
and
she
talked
in
this
way
so
long
and
successfully
that
when
forced
to
give
her
attention
again
to
her
father
and
sister
she
had
nothing
worse
to
hear
than
isabella
s
kind
inquiry
after
jane
fairfax
and
jane
fairfax
though
no
great
favourite
with
her
in
general
she
was
at
that
moment
very
happy
to
assist
in
praising
that
sweet
amiable
jane
fairfax
said
mrs
john
knightley
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
seen
her
except
now
and
then
for
a
moment
accidentally
in
town
what
happiness
it
must
be
to
her
good
old
grandmother
and
excellent
aunt
when
she
comes
to
visit
them
i
always
regret
excessively
on
dear
emma
s
account
that
she
cannot
be
more
at
highbury
but
now
their
daughter
is
married
i
suppose
colonel
and
mrs
campbell
will
not
be
able
to
part
with
her
at
all
she
would
be
such
a
delightful
companion
for
emma
mr
woodhouse
agreed
to
it
all
but
added
our
little
friend
harriet
smith
however
is
just
such
another
pretty
kind
of
young
person
you
will
like
harriet
emma
could
not
have
a
better
companion
than
harriet
i
am
most
happy
to
hear
it
but
only
jane
fairfax
one
knows
to
be
so
very
accomplished
and
superior
and
exactly
emma
s
age
this
topic
was
discussed
very
happily
and
others
succeeded
of
similar
moment
and
passed
away
with
similar
harmony
but
the
evening
did
not
close
without
a
little
return
of
agitation
the
gruel
came
and
supplied
a
great
deal
to
be
said
much
praise
and
many
comments
undoubting
decision
of
its
wholesomeness
for
every
constitution
and
pretty
severe
philippics
upon
the
many
houses
where
it
was
never
met
with
tolerable
but
unfortunately
among
the
failures
which
the
daughter
had
to
instance
the
most
recent
and
therefore
most
prominent
was
in
her
own
cook
at
south
end
a
young
woman
hired
for
the
time
who
never
had
been
able
to
understand
what
she
meant
by
a
basin
of
nice
smooth
gruel
thin
but
not
too
thin
often
as
she
had
wished
for
and
ordered
it
she
had
never
been
able
to
get
any
thing
tolerable
here
was
a
dangerous
opening
ah
said
mr
woodhouse
shaking
his
head
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
with
tender
concern
the
ejaculation
in
emma
s
ear
expressed
ah
there
is
no
end
of
the
sad
consequences
of
your
going
to
south
end
it
does
not
bear
talking
of
and
for
a
little
while
she
hoped
he
would
not
talk
of
it
and
that
a
silent
rumination
might
suffice
to
restore
him
to
the
relish
of
his
own
smooth
gruel
after
an
interval
of
some
minutes
however
he
began
with
i
shall
always
be
very
sorry
that
you
went
to
the
sea
this
autumn
instead
of
coming
here
but
why
should
you
be
sorry
sir
i
assure
you
it
did
the
children
a
great
deal
of
good
and
moreover
if
you
must
go
to
the
sea
it
had
better
not
have
been
to
south
end
south
end
is
an
unhealthy
place
perry
was
surprized
to
hear
you
had
fixed
upon
south
end
i
know
there
is
such
an
idea
with
many
people
but
indeed
it
is
quite
a
mistake
sir
we
all
had
our
health
perfectly
well
there
never
found
the
least
inconvenience
from
the
mud
and
mr
wingfield
says
it
is
entirely
a
mistake
to
suppose
the
place
unhealthy
and
i
am
sure
he
may
be
depended
on
for
he
thoroughly
understands
the
nature
of
the
air
and
his
own
brother
and
family
have
been
there
repeatedly
you
should
have
gone
to
cromer
my
dear
if
you
went
anywhere
perry
was
a
week
at
cromer
once
and
he
holds
it
to
be
the
best
of
all
the
sea
bathing
places
a
fine
open
sea
he
says
and
very
pure
air
and
by
what
i
understand
you
might
have
had
lodgings
there
quite
away
from
the
sea
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
very
comfortable
you
should
have
consulted
perry
but
my
dear
sir
the
difference
of
the
journey
only
consider
how
great
it
would
have
been
an
hundred
miles
perhaps
instead
of
forty
ah
my
dear
as
perry
says
where
health
is
at
stake
nothing
else
should
be
considered
and
if
one
is
to
travel
there
is
not
much
to
chuse
between
forty
miles
and
an
hundred
better
not
move
at
all
better
stay
in
london
altogether
than
travel
forty
miles
to
get
into
a
worse
air
this
is
just
what
perry
said
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
ill
judged
measure
emma
s
attempts
to
stop
her
father
had
been
vain
and
when
he
had
reached
such
a
point
as
this
she
could
not
wonder
at
her
brother
in
law
s
breaking
out
mr
perry
said
he
in
a
voice
of
very
strong
displeasure
would
do
as
well
to
keep
his
opinion
till
it
is
asked
for
why
does
he
make
it
any
business
of
his
to
wonder
at
what
i
do
at
my
taking
my
family
to
one
part
of
the
coast
or
another
i
may
be
allowed
i
hope
the
use
of
my
judgment
as
well
as
mr
perry
i
want
his
directions
no
more
than
his
drugs
he
paused
and
growing
cooler
in
a
moment
added
with
only
sarcastic
dryness
if
mr
perry
can
tell
me
how
to
convey
a
wife
and
five
children
a
distance
of
an
hundred
and
thirty
miles
with
no
greater
expense
or
inconvenience
than
a
distance
of
forty
i
should
be
as
willing
to
prefer
cromer
to
south
end
as
he
could
himself
true
true
cried
mr
knightley
with
most
ready
interposition
very
true
that
s
a
consideration
indeed
but
john
as
to
what
i
was
telling
you
of
my
idea
of
moving
the
path
to
langham
of
turning
it
more
to
the
right
that
it
may
not
cut
through
the
home
meadows
i
cannot
conceive
any
difficulty
i
should
not
attempt
it
if
it
were
to
be
the
means
of
inconvenience
to
the
highbury
people
but
if
you
call
to
mind
exactly
the
present
line
of
the
path
the
only
way
of
proving
it
however
will
be
to
turn
to
our
maps
i
shall
see
you
at
the
abbey
to
morrow
morning
i
hope
and
then
we
will
look
them
over
and
you
shall
give
me
your
opinion
mr
woodhouse
was
rather
agitated
by
such
harsh
reflections
on
his
friend
perry
to
whom
he
had
in
fact
though
unconsciously
been
attributing
many
of
his
own
feelings
and
expressions
but
the
soothing
attentions
of
his
daughters
gradually
removed
the
present
evil
and
the
immediate
alertness
of
one
brother
and
better
recollections
of
the
other
prevented
any
renewal
of
it
chapter
xiii
there
could
hardly
be
a
happier
creature
in
the
world
than
mrs
john
knightley
in
this
short
visit
to
hartfield
going
about
every
morning
among
her
old
acquaintance
with
her
five
children
and
talking
over
what
she
had
done
every
evening
with
her
father
and
sister
she
had
nothing
to
wish
otherwise
but
that
the
days
did
not
pass
so
swiftly
it
was
a
delightful
visit
perfect
in
being
much
too
short
in
general
their
evenings
were
less
engaged
with
friends
than
their
mornings
but
one
complete
dinner
engagement
and
out
of
the
house
too
there
was
no
avoiding
though
at
christmas
mr
weston
would
take
no
denial
they
must
all
dine
at
randalls
one
day
even
mr
woodhouse
was
persuaded
to
think
it
a
possible
thing
in
preference
to
a
division
of
the
party
how
they
were
all
to
be
conveyed
he
would
have
made
a
difficulty
if
he
could
but
as
his
son
and
daughter
s
carriage
and
horses
were
actually
at
hartfield
he
was
not
able
to
make
more
than
a
simple
question
on
that
head
it
hardly
amounted
to
a
doubt
nor
did
it
occupy
emma
long
to
convince
him
that
they
might
in
one
of
the
carriages
find
room
for
harriet
also
harriet
mr
elton
and
mr
knightley
their
own
especial
set
were
the
only
persons
invited
to
meet
them
the
hours
were
to
be
early
as
well
as
the
numbers
few
mr
woodhouse
s
habits
and
inclination
being
consulted
in
every
thing
the
evening
before
this
great
event
for
it
was
a
very
great
event
that
mr
woodhouse
should
dine
out
on
the
24th
of
december
had
been
spent
by
harriet
at
hartfield
and
she
had
gone
home
so
much
indisposed
with
a
cold
that
but
for
her
own
earnest
wish
of
being
nursed
by
mrs
goddard
emma
could
not
have
allowed
her
to
leave
the
house
emma
called
on
her
the
next
day
and
found
her
doom
already
signed
with
regard
to
randalls
she
was
very
feverish
and
had
a
bad
sore
throat
mrs
goddard
was
full
of
care
and
affection
mr
perry
was
talked
of
and
harriet
herself
was
too
ill
and
low
to
resist
the
authority
which
excluded
her
from
this
delightful
engagement
though
she
could
not
speak
of
her
loss
without
many
tears
emma
sat
with
her
as
long
as
she
could
to
attend
her
in
mrs
goddard
s
unavoidable
absences
and
raise
her
spirits
by
representing
how
much
mr
elton
s
would
be
depressed
when
he
knew
her
state
and
left
her
at
last
tolerably
comfortable
in
the
sweet
dependence
of
his
having
a
most
comfortless
visit
and
of
their
all
missing
her
very
much
she
had
not
advanced
many
yards
from
mrs
goddard
s
door
when
she
was
met
by
mr
elton
himself
evidently
coming
towards
it
and
as
they
walked
on
slowly
together
in
conversation
about
the
invalid
of
whom
he
on
the
rumour
of
considerable
illness
had
been
going
to
inquire
that
he
might
carry
some
report
of
her
to
hartfield
they
were
overtaken
by
mr
john
knightley
returning
from
the
daily
visit
to
donwell
with
his
two
eldest
boys
whose
healthy
glowing
faces
shewed
all
the
benefit
of
a
country
run
and
seemed
to
ensure
a
quick
despatch
of
the
roast
mutton
and
rice
pudding
they
were
hastening
home
for
they
joined
company
and
proceeded
together
emma
was
just
describing
the
nature
of
her
friend
s
complaint
a
throat
very
much
inflamed
with
a
great
deal
of
heat
about
her
a
quick
low
pulse
c
and
she
was
sorry
to
find
from
mrs
goddard
that
harriet
was
liable
to
very
bad
sore
throats
and
had
often
alarmed
her
with
them
mr
elton
looked
all
alarm
on
the
occasion
as
he
exclaimed
a
sore
throat
i
hope
not
infectious
i
hope
not
of
a
putrid
infectious
sort
has
perry
seen
her
indeed
you
should
take
care
of
yourself
as
well
as
of
your
friend
let
me
entreat
you
to
run
no
risks
why
does
not
perry
see
her
emma
who
was
not
really
at
all
frightened
herself
tranquillised
this
excess
of
apprehension
by
assurances
of
mrs
goddard
s
experience
and
care
but
as
there
must
still
remain
a
degree
of
uneasiness
which
she
could
not
wish
to
reason
away
which
she
would
rather
feed
and
assist
than
not
she
added
soon
afterwards
as
if
quite
another
subject
it
is
so
cold
so
very
cold
and
looks
and
feels
so
very
much
like
snow
that
if
it
were
to
any
other
place
or
with
any
other
party
i
should
really
try
not
to
go
out
to
day
and
dissuade
my
father
from
venturing
but
as
he
has
made
up
his
mind
and
does
not
seem
to
feel
the
cold
himself
i
do
not
like
to
interfere
as
i
know
it
would
be
so
great
a
disappointment
to
mr
and
mrs
weston
but
upon
my
word
mr
elton
in
your
case
i
should
certainly
excuse
myself
you
appear
to
me
a
little
hoarse
already
and
when
you
consider
what
demand
of
voice
and
what
fatigues
to
morrow
will
bring
i
think
it
would
be
no
more
than
common
prudence
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
yourself
to
night
mr
elton
looked
as
if
he
did
not
very
well
know
what
answer
to
make
which
was
exactly
the
case
for
though
very
much
gratified
by
the
kind
care
of
such
a
fair
lady
and
not
liking
to
resist
any
advice
of
her
s
he
had
not
really
the
least
inclination
to
give
up
the
visit
but
emma
too
eager
and
busy
in
her
own
previous
conceptions
and
views
to
hear
him
impartially
or
see
him
with
clear
vision
was
very
well
satisfied
with
his
muttering
acknowledgment
of
its
being
very
cold
certainly
very
cold
and
walked
on
rejoicing
in
having
extricated
him
from
randalls
and
secured
him
the
power
of
sending
to
inquire
after
harriet
every
hour
of
the
evening
you
do
quite
right
said
she
we
will
make
your
apologies
to
mr
and
mrs
weston
but
hardly
had
she
so
spoken
when
she
found
her
brother
was
civilly
offering
a
seat
in
his
carriage
if
the
weather
were
mr
elton
s
only
objection
and
mr
elton
actually
accepting
the
offer
with
much
prompt
satisfaction
it
was
a
done
thing
mr
elton
was
to
go
and
never
had
his
broad
handsome
face
expressed
more
pleasure
than
at
this
moment
never
had
his
smile
been
stronger
nor
his
eyes
more
exulting
than
when
he
next
looked
at
her
well
said
she
to
herself
this
is
most
strange
after
i
had
got
him
off
so
well
to
chuse
to
go
into
company
and
leave
harriet
ill
behind
most
strange
indeed
but
there
is
i
believe
in
many
men
especially
single
men
such
an
inclination
such
a
passion
for
dining
out
a
dinner
engagement
is
so
high
in
the
class
of
their
pleasures
their
employments
their
dignities
almost
their
duties
that
any
thing
gives
way
to
it
and
this
must
be
the
case
with
mr
elton
a
most
valuable
amiable
pleasing
young
man
undoubtedly
and
very
much
in
love
with
harriet
but
still
he
cannot
refuse
an
invitation
he
must
dine
out
wherever
he
is
asked
what
a
strange
thing
love
is
he
can
see
ready
wit
in
harriet
but
will
not
dine
alone
for
her
soon
afterwards
mr
elton
quitted
them
and
she
could
not
but
do
him
the
justice
of
feeling
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
in
his
manner
of
naming
harriet
at
parting
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
while
assuring
her
that
he
should
call
at
mrs
goddard
s
for
news
of
her
fair
friend
the
last
thing
before
he
prepared
for
the
happiness
of
meeting
her
again
when
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
a
better
report
and
he
sighed
and
smiled
himself
off
in
a
way
that
left
the
balance
of
approbation
much
in
his
favour
after
a
few
minutes
of
entire
silence
between
them
john
knightley
began
with
i
never
in
my
life
saw
a
man
more
intent
on
being
agreeable
than
mr
elton
it
is
downright
labour
to
him
where
ladies
are
concerned
with
men
he
can
be
rational
and
unaffected
but
when
he
has
ladies
to
please
every
feature
works
mr
elton
s
manners
are
not
perfect
replied
emma
but
where
there
is
a
wish
to
please
one
ought
to
overlook
and
one
does
overlook
a
great
deal
where
a
man
does
his
best
with
only
moderate
powers
he
will
have
the
advantage
over
negligent
superiority
there
is
such
perfect
good
temper
and
good
will
in
mr
elton
as
one
cannot
but
value
yes
said
mr
john
knightley
presently
with
some
slyness
he
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
good
will
towards
you
me
she
replied
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
are
you
imagining
me
to
be
mr
elton
s
object
such
an
imagination
has
crossed
me
i
own
emma
and
if
it
never
occurred
to
you
before
you
may
as
well
take
it
into
consideration
now
mr
elton
in
love
with
me
what
an
idea
i
do
not
say
it
is
so
but
you
will
do
well
to
consider
whether
it
is
so
or
not
and
to
regulate
your
behaviour
accordingly
i
think
your
manners
to
him
encouraging
i
speak
as
a
friend
emma
you
had
better
look
about
you
and
ascertain
what
you
do
and
what
you
mean
to
do
i
thank
you
but
i
assure
you
you
are
quite
mistaken
mr
elton
and
i
are
very
good
friends
and
nothing
more
and
she
walked
on
amusing
herself
in
the
consideration
of
the
blunders
which
often
arise
from
a
partial
knowledge
of
circumstances
of
the
mistakes
which
people
of
high
pretensions
to
judgment
are
for
ever
falling
into
and
not
very
well
pleased
with
her
brother
for
imagining
her
blind
and
ignorant
and
in
want
of
counsel
he
said
no
more
mr
woodhouse
had
so
completely
made
up
his
mind
to
the
visit
that
in
spite
of
the
increasing
coldness
he
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
shrinking
from
it
and
set
forward
at
last
most
punctually
with
his
eldest
daughter
in
his
own
carriage
with
less
apparent
consciousness
of
the
weather
than
either
of
the
others
too
full
of
the
wonder
of
his
own
going
and
the
pleasure
it
was
to
afford
at
randalls
to
see
that
it
was
cold
and
too
well
wrapt
up
to
feel
it
the
cold
however
was
severe
and
by
the
time
the
second
carriage
was
in
motion
a
few
flakes
of
snow
were
finding
their
way
down
and
the
sky
had
the
appearance
of
being
so
overcharged
as
to
want
only
a
milder
air
to
produce
a
very
white
world
in
a
very
short
time
emma
soon
saw
that
her
companion
was
not
in
the
happiest
humour
the
preparing
and
the
going
abroad
in
such
weather
with
the
sacrifice
of
his
children
after
dinner
were
evils
were
disagreeables
at
least
which
mr
john
knightley
did
not
by
any
means
like
he
anticipated
nothing
in
the
visit
that
could
be
at
all
worth
the
purchase
and
the
whole
of
their
drive
to
the
vicarage
was
spent
by
him
in
expressing
his
discontent
a
man
said
he
must
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
when
he
asks
people
to
leave
their
own
fireside
and
encounter
such
a
day
as
this
for
the
sake
of
coming
to
see
him
he
must
think
himself
a
most
agreeable
fellow
i
could
not
do
such
a
thing
it
is
the
greatest
absurdity
actually
snowing
at
this
moment
the
folly
of
not
allowing
people
to
be
comfortable
at
home
and
the
folly
of
people
s
not
staying
comfortably
at
home
when
they
can
if
we
were
obliged
to
go
out
such
an
evening
as
this
by
any
call
of
duty
or
business
what
a
hardship
we
should
deem
it
and
here
are
we
probably
with
rather
thinner
clothing
than
usual
setting
forward
voluntarily
without
excuse
in
defiance
of
the
voice
of
nature
which
tells
man
in
every
thing
given
to
his
view
or
his
feelings
to
stay
at
home
himself
and
keep
all
under
shelter
that
he
can
here
are
we
setting
forward
to
spend
five
dull
hours
in
another
man
s
house
with
nothing
to
say
or
to
hear
that
was
not
said
and
heard
yesterday
and
may
not
be
said
and
heard
again
to
morrow
going
in
dismal
weather
to
return
probably
in
worse
four
horses
and
four
servants
taken
out
for
nothing
but
to
convey
five
idle
shivering
creatures
into
colder
rooms
and
worse
company
than
they
might
have
had
at
home
emma
did
not
find
herself
equal
to
give
the
pleased
assent
which
no
doubt
he
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
to
emulate
the
very
true
my
love
which
must
have
been
usually
administered
by
his
travelling
companion
but
she
had
resolution
enough
to
refrain
from
making
any
answer
at
all
she
could
not
be
complying
she
dreaded
being
quarrelsome
her
heroism
reached
only
to
silence
she
allowed
him
to
talk
and
arranged
the
glasses
and
wrapped
herself
up
without
opening
her
lips
they
arrived
the
carriage
turned
the
step
was
let
down
and
mr
elton
spruce
black
and
smiling
was
with
them
instantly
emma
thought
with
pleasure
of
some
change
of
subject
mr
elton
was
all
obligation
and
cheerfulness
he
was
so
very
cheerful
in
his
civilities
indeed
that
she
began
to
think
he
must
have
received
a
different
account
of
harriet
from
what
had
reached
her
she
had
sent
while
dressing
and
the
answer
had
been
much
the
same
not
better
my
report
from
mrs
goddard
s
said
she
presently
was
not
so
pleasant
as
i
had
hoped
not
better
was
my
answer
his
face
lengthened
immediately
and
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
sentiment
as
he
answered
oh
no
i
am
grieved
to
find
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
you
that
when
i
called
at
mrs
goddard
s
door
which
i
did
the
very
last
thing
before
i
returned
to
dress
i
was
told
that
miss
smith
was
not
better
by
no
means
better
rather
worse
very
much
grieved
and
concerned
i
had
flattered
myself
that
she
must
be
better
after
such
a
cordial
as
i
knew
had
been
given
her
in
the
morning
emma
smiled
and
answered
my
visit
was
of
use
to
the
nervous
part
of
her
complaint
i
hope
but
not
even
i
can
charm
away
a
sore
throat
it
is
a
most
severe
cold
indeed
mr
perry
has
been
with
her
as
you
probably
heard
yes
i
imagined
that
is
i
did
not
he
has
been
used
to
her
in
these
complaints
and
i
hope
to
morrow
morning
will
bring
us
both
a
more
comfortable
report
but
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
uneasiness
such
a
sad
loss
to
our
party
to
day
dreadful
exactly
so
indeed
she
will
be
missed
every
moment
this
was
very
proper
the
sigh
which
accompanied
it
was
really
estimable
but
it
should
have
lasted
longer
emma
was
rather
in
dismay
when
only
half
a
minute
afterwards
he
began
to
speak
of
other
things
and
in
a
voice
of
the
greatest
alacrity
and
enjoyment
what
an
excellent
device
said
he
the
use
of
a
sheepskin
for
carriages
how
very
comfortable
they
make
it
impossible
to
feel
cold
with
such
precautions
the
contrivances
of
modern
days
indeed
have
rendered
a
gentleman
s
carriage
perfectly
complete
one
is
so
fenced
and
guarded
from
the
weather
that
not
a
breath
of
air
can
find
its
way
unpermitted
weather
becomes
absolutely
of
no
consequence
it
is
a
very
cold
afternoon
but
in
this
carriage
we
know
nothing
of
the
matter
ha
snows
a
little
i
see
yes
said
john
knightley
and
i
think
we
shall
have
a
good
deal
of
it
christmas
weather
observed
mr
elton
quite
seasonable
and
extremely
fortunate
we
may
think
ourselves
that
it
did
not
begin
yesterday
and
prevent
this
day
s
party
which
it
might
very
possibly
have
done
for
mr
woodhouse
would
hardly
have
ventured
had
there
been
much
snow
on
the
ground
but
now
it
is
of
no
consequence
this
is
quite
the
season
indeed
for
friendly
meetings
at
christmas
every
body
invites
their
friends
about
them
and
people
think
little
of
even
the
worst
weather
i
was
snowed
up
at
a
friend
s
house
once
for
a
week
nothing
could
be
pleasanter
i
went
for
only
one
night
and
could
not
get
away
till
that
very
day
se
nnight
mr
john
knightley
looked
as
if
he
did
not
comprehend
the
pleasure
but
said
only
coolly
i
cannot
wish
to
be
snowed
up
a
week
at
randalls
at
another
time
emma
might
have
been
amused
but
she
was
too
much
astonished
now
at
mr
elton
s
spirits
for
other
feelings
harriet
seemed
quite
forgotten
in
the
expectation
of
a
pleasant
party
we
are
sure
of
excellent
fires
continued
he
and
every
thing
in
the
greatest
comfort
charming
people
mr
and
mrs
weston
mrs
weston
indeed
is
much
beyond
praise
and
he
is
exactly
what
one
values
so
hospitable
and
so
fond
of
society
it
will
be
a
small
party
but
where
small
parties
are
select
they
are
perhaps
the
most
agreeable
of
any
mr
weston
s
dining
room
does
not
accommodate
more
than
ten
comfortably
and
for
my
part
i
would
rather
under
such
circumstances
fall
short
by
two
than
exceed
by
two
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
turning
with
a
soft
air
to
emma
i
think
i
shall
certainly
have
your
approbation
though
mr
knightley
perhaps
from
being
used
to
the
large
parties
of
london
may
not
quite
enter
into
our
feelings
i
know
nothing
of
the
large
parties
of
london
sir
i
never
dine
with
any
body
indeed
in
a
tone
of
wonder
and
pity
i
had
no
idea
that
the
law
had
been
so
great
a
slavery
well
sir
the
time
must
come
when
you
will
be
paid
for
all
this
when
you
will
have
little
labour
and
great
enjoyment
my
first
enjoyment
replied
john
knightley
as
they
passed
through
the
sweep
gate
will
be
to
find
myself
safe
at
hartfield
again
chapter
xiv
some
change
of
countenance
was
necessary
for
each
gentleman
as
they
walked
into
mrs
weston
s
drawing
room
mr
elton
must
compose
his
joyous
looks
and
mr
john
knightley
disperse
his
ill
humour
mr
elton
must
smile
less
and
mr
john
knightley
more
to
fit
them
for
the
place
emma
only
might
be
as
nature
prompted
and
shew
herself
just
as
happy
as
she
was
to
her
it
was
real
enjoyment
to
be
with
the
westons
mr
weston
was
a
great
favourite
and
there
was
not
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
she
spoke
with
such
unreserve
as
to
his
wife
not
any
one
to
whom
she
related
with
such
conviction
of
being
listened
to
and
understood
of
being
always
interesting
and
always
intelligible
the
little
affairs
arrangements
perplexities
and
pleasures
of
her
father
and
herself
she
could
tell
nothing
of
hartfield
in
which
mrs
weston
had
not
a
lively
concern
and
half
an
hour
s
uninterrupted
communication
of
all
those
little
matters
on
which
the
daily
happiness
of
private
life
depends
was
one
of
the
first
gratifications
of
each
this
was
a
pleasure
which
perhaps
the
whole
day
s
visit
might
not
afford
which
certainly
did
not
belong
to
the
present
half
hour
but
the
very
sight
of
mrs
weston
her
smile
her
touch
her
voice
was
grateful
to
emma
and
she
determined
to
think
as
little
as
possible
of
mr
elton
s
oddities
or
of
any
thing
else
unpleasant
and
enjoy
all
that
was
enjoyable
to
the
utmost
the
misfortune
of
harriet
s
cold
had
been
pretty
well
gone
through
before
her
arrival
mr
woodhouse
had
been
safely
seated
long
enough
to
give
the
history
of
it
besides
all
the
history
of
his
own
and
isabella
s
coming
and
of
emma
s
being
to
follow
and
had
indeed
just
got
to
the
end
of
his
satisfaction
that
james
should
come
and
see
his
daughter
when
the
others
appeared
and
mrs
weston
who
had
been
almost
wholly
engrossed
by
her
attentions
to
him
was
able
to
turn
away
and
welcome
her
dear
emma
emma
s
project
of
forgetting
mr
elton
for
a
while
made
her
rather
sorry
to
find
when
they
had
all
taken
their
places
that
he
was
close
to
her
the
difficulty
was
great
of
driving
his
strange
insensibility
towards
harriet
from
her
mind
while
he
not
only
sat
at
her
elbow
but
was
continually
obtruding
his
happy
countenance
on
her
notice
and
solicitously
addressing
her
upon
every
occasion
instead
of
forgetting
him
his
behaviour
was
such
that
she
could
not
avoid
the
internal
suggestion
of
can
it
really
be
as
my
brother
imagined
can
it
be
possible
for
this
man
to
be
beginning
to
transfer
his
affections
from
harriet
to
me
absurd
and
insufferable
yet
he
would
be
so
anxious
for
her
being
perfectly
warm
would
be
so
interested
about
her
father
and
so
delighted
with
mrs
weston
and
at
last
would
begin
admiring
her
drawings
with
so
much
zeal
and
so
little
knowledge
as
seemed
terribly
like
a
would
be
lover
and
made
it
some
effort
with
her
to
preserve
her
good
manners
for
her
own
sake
she
could
not
be
rude
and
for
harriet
s
in
the
hope
that
all
would
yet
turn
out
right
she
was
even
positively
civil
but
it
was
an
effort
especially
as
something
was
going
on
amongst
the
others
in
the
most
overpowering
period
of
mr
elton
s
nonsense
which
she
particularly
wished
to
listen
to
she
heard
enough
to
know
that
mr
weston
was
giving
some
information
about
his
son
she
heard
the
words
my
son
and
frank
and
my
son
repeated
several
times
over
and
from
a
few
other
half
syllables
very
much
suspected
that
he
was
announcing
an
early
visit
from
his
son
but
before
she
could
quiet
mr
elton
the
subject
was
so
completely
past
that
any
reviving
question
from
her
would
have
been
awkward
now
it
so
happened
that
in
spite
of
emma
s
resolution
of
never
marrying
there
was
something
in
the
name
in
the
idea
of
mr
frank
churchill
which
always
interested
her
she
had
frequently
thought
especially
since
his
father
s
marriage
with
miss
taylor
that
if
she
were
to
marry
he
was
the
very
person
to
suit
her
in
age
character
and
condition
he
seemed
by
this
connexion
between
the
families
quite
to
belong
to
her
she
could
not
but
suppose
it
to
be
a
match
that
every
body
who
knew
them
must
think
of
that
mr
and
mrs
weston
did
think
of
it
she
was
very
strongly
persuaded
and
though
not
meaning
to
be
induced
by
him
or
by
any
body
else
to
give
up
a
situation
which
she
believed
more
replete
with
good
than
any
she
could
change
it
for
she
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
him
a
decided
intention
of
finding
him
pleasant
of
being
liked
by
him
to
a
certain
degree
and
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
their
being
coupled
in
their
friends
imaginations
with
such
sensations
mr
elton
s
civilities
were
dreadfully
ill
timed
but
she
had
the
comfort
of
appearing
very
polite
while
feeling
very
cross
and
of
thinking
that
the
rest
of
the
visit
could
not
possibly
pass
without
bringing
forward
the
same
information
again
or
the
substance
of
it
from
the
open
hearted
mr
weston
so
it
proved
for
when
happily
released
from
mr
elton
and
seated
by
mr
weston
at
dinner
he
made
use
of
the
very
first
interval
in
the
cares
of
hospitality
the
very
first
leisure
from
the
saddle
of
mutton
to
say
to
her
we
want
only
two
more
to
be
just
the
right
number
i
should
like
to
see
two
more
here
your
pretty
little
friend
miss
smith
and
my
son
and
then
i
should
say
we
were
quite
complete
i
believe
you
did
not
hear
me
telling
the
others
in
the
drawing
room
that
we
are
expecting
frank
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
and
he
will
be
with
us
within
a
fortnight
emma
spoke
with
a
very
proper
degree
of
pleasure
and
fully
assented
to
his
proposition
of
mr
frank
churchill
and
miss
smith
making
their
party
quite
complete
he
has
been
wanting
to
come
to
us
continued
mr
weston
ever
since
september
every
letter
has
been
full
of
it
but
he
cannot
command
his
own
time
he
has
those
to
please
who
must
be
pleased
and
who
between
ourselves
are
sometimes
to
be
pleased
only
by
a
good
many
sacrifices
but
now
i
have
no
doubt
of
seeing
him
here
about
the
second
week
in
january
what
a
very
great
pleasure
it
will
be
to
you
and
mrs
weston
is
so
anxious
to
be
acquainted
with
him
that
she
must
be
almost
as
happy
as
yourself
yes
she
would
be
but
that
she
thinks
there
will
be
another
put
off
she
does
not
depend
upon
his
coming
so
much
as
i
do
but
she
does
not
know
the
parties
so
well
as
i
do
the
case
you
see
is
but
this
is
quite
between
ourselves
i
did
not
mention
a
syllable
of
it
in
the
other
room
there
are
secrets
in
all
families
you
know
the
case
is
that
a
party
of
friends
are
invited
to
pay
a
visit
at
enscombe
in
january
and
that
frank
s
coming
depends
upon
their
being
put
off
if
they
are
not
put
off
he
cannot
stir
but
i
know
they
will
because
it
is
a
family
that
a
certain
lady
of
some
consequence
at
enscombe
has
a
particular
dislike
to
and
though
it
is
thought
necessary
to
invite
them
once
in
two
or
three
years
they
always
are
put
off
when
it
comes
to
the
point
i
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
the
issue
i
am
as
confident
of
seeing
frank
here
before
the
middle
of
january
as
i
am
of
being
here
myself
but
your
good
friend
there
nodding
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
table
has
so
few
vagaries
herself
and
has
been
so
little
used
to
them
at
hartfield
that
she
cannot
calculate
on
their
effects
as
i
have
been
long
in
the
practice
of
doing
i
am
sorry
there
should
be
any
thing
like
doubt
in
the
case
replied
emma
but
am
disposed
to
side
with
you
mr
weston
if
you
think
he
will
come
i
shall
think
so
too
for
you
know
enscombe
yes
i
have
some
right
to
that
knowledge
though
i
have
never
been
at
the
place
in
my
life
she
is
an
odd
woman
but
i
never
allow
myself
to
speak
ill
of
her
on
frank
s
account
for
i
do
believe
her
to
be
very
fond
of
him
i
used
to
think
she
was
not
capable
of
being
fond
of
any
body
except
herself
but
she
has
always
been
kind
to
him
in
her
way
allowing
for
little
whims
and
caprices
and
expecting
every
thing
to
be
as
she
likes
and
it
is
no
small
credit
in
my
opinion
to
him
that
he
should
excite
such
an
affection
for
though
i
would
not
say
it
to
any
body
else
she
has
no
more
heart
than
a
stone
to
people
in
general
and
the
devil
of
a
temper
emma
liked
the
subject
so
well
that
she
began
upon
it
to
mrs
weston
very
soon
after
their
moving
into
the
drawing
room
wishing
her
joy
yet
observing
that
she
knew
the
first
meeting
must
be
rather
alarming
mrs
weston
agreed
to
it
but
added
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
be
secure
of
undergoing
the
anxiety
of
a
first
meeting
at
the
time
talked
of
for
i
cannot
depend
upon
his
coming
i
cannot
be
so
sanguine
as
mr
weston
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
will
all
end
in
nothing
mr
weston
i
dare
say
has
been
telling
you
exactly
how
the
matter
stands
yes
it
seems
to
depend
upon
nothing
but
the
ill
humour
of
mrs
churchill
which
i
imagine
to
be
the
most
certain
thing
in
the
world
my
emma
replied
mrs
weston
smiling
what
is
the
certainty
of
caprice
then
turning
to
isabella
who
had
not
been
attending
before
you
must
know
my
dear
mrs
knightley
that
we
are
by
no
means
so
sure
of
seeing
mr
frank
churchill
in
my
opinion
as
his
father
thinks
it
depends
entirely
upon
his
aunt
s
spirits
and
pleasure
in
short
upon
her
temper
to
you
to
my
two
daughters
i
may
venture
on
the
truth
mrs
churchill
rules
at
enscombe
and
is
a
very
odd
tempered
woman
and
his
coming
now
depends
upon
her
being
willing
to
spare
him
oh
mrs
churchill
every
body
knows
mrs
churchill
replied
isabella
and
i
am
sure
i
never
think
of
that
poor
young
man
without
the
greatest
compassion
to
be
constantly
living
with
an
ill
tempered
person
must
be
dreadful
it
is
what
we
happily
have
never
known
any
thing
of
but
it
must
be
a
life
of
misery
what
a
blessing
that
she
never
had
any
children
poor
little
creatures
how
unhappy
she
would
have
made
them
emma
wished
she
had
been
alone
with
mrs
weston
she
should
then
have
heard
more
mrs
weston
would
speak
to
her
with
a
degree
of
unreserve
which
she
would
not
hazard
with
isabella
and
she
really
believed
would
scarcely
try
to
conceal
any
thing
relative
to
the
churchills
from
her
excepting
those
views
on
the
young
man
of
which
her
own
imagination
had
already
given
her
such
instinctive
knowledge
but
at
present
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
mr
woodhouse
very
soon
followed
them
into
the
drawing
room
to
be
sitting
long
after
dinner
was
a
confinement
that
he
could
not
endure
neither
wine
nor
conversation
was
any
thing
to
him
and
gladly
did
he
move
to
those
with
whom
he
was
always
comfortable
while
he
talked
to
isabella
however
emma
found
an
opportunity
of
saying
and
so
you
do
not
consider
this
visit
from
your
son
as
by
any
means
certain
i
am
sorry
for
it
the
introduction
must
be
unpleasant
whenever
it
takes
place
and
the
sooner
it
could
be
over
the
better
yes
and
every
delay
makes
one
more
apprehensive
of
other
delays
even
if
this
family
the
braithwaites
are
put
off
i
am
still
afraid
that
some
excuse
may
be
found
for
disappointing
us
i
cannot
bear
to
imagine
any
reluctance
on
his
side
but
i
am
sure
there
is
a
great
wish
on
the
churchills
to
keep
him
to
themselves
there
is
jealousy
they
are
jealous
even
of
his
regard
for
his
father
in
short
i
can
feel
no
dependence
on
his
coming
and
i
wish
mr
weston
were
less
sanguine
he
ought
to
come
said
emma
if
he
could
stay
only
a
couple
of
days
he
ought
to
come
and
one
can
hardly
conceive
a
young
man
s
not
having
it
in
his
power
to
do
as
much
as
that
a
young
woman
if
she
fall
into
bad
hands
may
be
teased
and
kept
at
a
distance
from
those
she
wants
to
be
with
but
one
cannot
comprehend
a
young
man
s
being
under
such
restraint
as
not
to
be
able
to
spend
a
week
with
his
father
if
he
likes
it
one
ought
to
be
at
enscombe
and
know
the
ways
of
the
family
before
one
decides
upon
what
he
can
do
replied
mrs
weston
one
ought
to
use
the
same
caution
perhaps
in
judging
of
the
conduct
of
any
one
individual
of
any
one
family
but
enscombe
i
believe
certainly
must
not
be
judged
by
general
rules
she
is
so
very
unreasonable
and
every
thing
gives
way
to
her
but
she
is
so
fond
of
the
nephew
he
is
so
very
great
a
favourite
now
according
to
my
idea
of
mrs
churchill
it
would
be
most
natural
that
while
she
makes
no
sacrifice
for
the
comfort
of
the
husband
to
whom
she
owes
every
thing
while
she
exercises
incessant
caprice
towards
him
she
should
frequently
be
governed
by
the
nephew
to
whom
she
owes
nothing
at
all
my
dearest
emma
do
not
pretend
with
your
sweet
temper
to
understand
a
bad
one
or
to
lay
down
rules
for
it
you
must
let
it
go
its
own
way
i
have
no
doubt
of
his
having
at
times
considerable
influence
but
it
may
be
perfectly
impossible
for
him
to
know
beforehand
when
it
will
be
emma
listened
and
then
coolly
said
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
unless
he
comes
he
may
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
on
some
points
continued
mrs
weston
and
on
others
very
little
and
among
those
on
which
she
is
beyond
his
reach
it
is
but
too
likely
may
be
this
very
circumstance
of
his
coming
away
from
them
to
visit
us
chapter
xv
mr
woodhouse
was
soon
ready
for
his
tea
and
when
he
had
drank
his
tea
he
was
quite
ready
to
go
home
and
it
was
as
much
as
his
three
companions
could
do
to
entertain
away
his
notice
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
before
the
other
gentlemen
appeared
mr
weston
was
chatty
and
convivial
and
no
friend
to
early
separations
of
any
sort
but
at
last
the
drawing
room
party
did
receive
an
augmentation
mr
elton
in
very
good
spirits
was
one
of
the
first
to
walk
in
mrs
weston
and
emma
were
sitting
together
on
a
sofa
he
joined
them
immediately
and
with
scarcely
an
invitation
seated
himself
between
them
emma
in
good
spirits
too
from
the
amusement
afforded
her
mind
by
the
expectation
of
mr
frank
churchill
was
willing
to
forget
his
late
improprieties
and
be
as
well
satisfied
with
him
as
before
and
on
his
making
harriet
his
very
first
subject
was
ready
to
listen
with
most
friendly
smiles
he
professed
himself
extremely
anxious
about
her
fair
friend
her
fair
lovely
amiable
friend
did
she
know
had
she
heard
any
thing
about
her
since
their
being
at
randalls
he
felt
much
anxiety
he
must
confess
that
the
nature
of
her
complaint
alarmed
him
considerably
and
in
this
style
he
talked
on
for
some
time
very
properly
not
much
attending
to
any
answer
but
altogether
sufficiently
awake
to
the
terror
of
a
bad
sore
throat
and
emma
was
quite
in
charity
with
him
but
at
last
there
seemed
a
perverse
turn
it
seemed
all
at
once
as
if
he
were
more
afraid
of
its
being
a
bad
sore
throat
on
her
account
than
on
harriet
s
more
anxious
that
she
should
escape
the
infection
than
that
there
should
be
no
infection
in
the
complaint
he
began
with
great
earnestness
to
entreat
her
to
refrain
from
visiting
the
sick
chamber
again
for
the
present
to
entreat
her
to
promise
him
not
to
venture
into
such
hazard
till
he
had
seen
mr
perry
and
learnt
his
opinion
and
though
she
tried
to
laugh
it
off
and
bring
the
subject
back
into
its
proper
course
there
was
no
putting
an
end
to
his
extreme
solicitude
about
her
she
was
vexed
it
did
appear
there
was
no
concealing
it
exactly
like
the
pretence
of
being
in
love
with
her
instead
of
harriet
an
inconstancy
if
real
the
most
contemptible
and
abominable
and
she
had
difficulty
in
behaving
with
temper
he
turned
to
mrs
weston
to
implore
her
assistance
would
not
she
give
him
her
support
would
not
she
add
her
persuasions
to
his
to
induce
miss
woodhouse
not
to
go
to
mrs
goddard
s
till
it
were
certain
that
miss
smith
s
disorder
had
no
infection
he
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
promise
would
not
she
give
him
her
influence
in
procuring
it
so
scrupulous
for
others
he
continued
and
yet
so
careless
for
herself
she
wanted
me
to
nurse
my
cold
by
staying
at
home
to
day
and
yet
will
not
promise
to
avoid
the
danger
of
catching
an
ulcerated
sore
throat
herself
is
this
fair
mrs
weston
judge
between
us
have
not
i
some
right
to
complain
i
am
sure
of
your
kind
support
and
aid
emma
saw
mrs
weston
s
surprize
and
felt
that
it
must
be
great
at
an
address
which
in
words
and
manner
was
assuming
to
himself
the
right
of
first
interest
in
her
and
as
for
herself
she
was
too
much
provoked
and
offended
to
have
the
power
of
directly
saying
any
thing
to
the
purpose
she
could
only
give
him
a
look
but
it
was
such
a
look
as
she
thought
must
restore
him
to
his
senses
and
then
left
the
sofa
removing
to
a
seat
by
her
sister
and
giving
her
all
her
attention
she
had
not
time
to
know
how
mr
elton
took
the
reproof
so
rapidly
did
another
subject
succeed
for
mr
john
knightley
now
came
into
the
room
from
examining
the
weather
and
opened
on
them
all
with
the
information
of
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
and
of
its
still
snowing
fast
with
a
strong
drifting
wind
concluding
with
these
words
to
mr
woodhouse
this
will
prove
a
spirited
beginning
of
your
winter
engagements
sir
something
new
for
your
coachman
and
horses
to
be
making
their
way
through
a
storm
of
snow
poor
mr
woodhouse
was
silent
from
consternation
but
every
body
else
had
something
to
say
every
body
was
either
surprized
or
not
surprized
and
had
some
question
to
ask
or
some
comfort
to
offer
mrs
weston
and
emma
tried
earnestly
to
cheer
him
and
turn
his
attention
from
his
son
in
law
who
was
pursuing
his
triumph
rather
unfeelingly
i
admired
your
resolution
very
much
sir
said
he
in
venturing
out
in
such
weather
for
of
course
you
saw
there
would
be
snow
very
soon
every
body
must
have
seen
the
snow
coming
on
i
admired
your
spirit
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
get
home
very
well
another
hour
or
two
s
snow
can
hardly
make
the
road
impassable
and
we
are
two
carriages
if
one
is
blown
over
in
the
bleak
part
of
the
common
field
there
will
be
the
other
at
hand
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
all
safe
at
hartfield
before
midnight
mr
weston
with
triumph
of
a
different
sort
was
confessing
that
he
had
known
it
to
be
snowing
some
time
but
had
not
said
a
word
lest
it
should
make
mr
woodhouse
uncomfortable
and
be
an
excuse
for
his
hurrying
away
as
to
there
being
any
quantity
of
snow
fallen
or
likely
to
fall
to
impede
their
return
that
was
a
mere
joke
he
was
afraid
they
would
find
no
difficulty
he
wished
the
road
might
be
impassable
that
he
might
be
able
to
keep
them
all
at
randalls
and
with
the
utmost
good
will
was
sure
that
accommodation
might
be
found
for
every
body
calling
on
his
wife
to
agree
with
him
that
with
a
little
contrivance
every
body
might
be
lodged
which
she
hardly
knew
how
to
do
from
the
consciousness
of
there
being
but
two
spare
rooms
in
the
house
what
is
to
be
done
my
dear
emma
what
is
to
be
done
was
mr
woodhouse
s
first
exclamation
and
all
that
he
could
say
for
some
time
to
her
he
looked
for
comfort
and
her
assurances
of
safety
her
representation
of
the
excellence
of
the
horses
and
of
james
and
of
their
having
so
many
friends
about
them
revived
him
a
little
his
eldest
daughter
s
alarm
was
equal
to
his
own
the
horror
of
being
blocked
up
at
randalls
while
her
children
were
at
hartfield
was
full
in
her
imagination
and
fancying
the
road
to
be
now
just
passable
for
adventurous
people
but
in
a
state
that
admitted
no
delay
she
was
eager
to
have
it
settled
that
her
father
and
emma
should
remain
at
randalls
while
she
and
her
husband
set
forward
instantly
through
all
the
possible
accumulations
of
drifted
snow
that
might
impede
them
you
had
better
order
the
carriage
directly
my
love
said
she
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
able
to
get
along
if
we
set
off
directly
and
if
we
do
come
to
any
thing
very
bad
i
can
get
out
and
walk
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
i
should
not
mind
walking
half
the
way
i
could
change
my
shoes
you
know
the
moment
i
got
home
and
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
gives
me
cold
indeed
replied
he
then
my
dear
isabella
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
sort
of
thing
in
the
world
for
in
general
every
thing
does
give
you
cold
walk
home
you
are
prettily
shod
for
walking
home
i
dare
say
it
will
be
bad
enough
for
the
horses
isabella
turned
to
mrs
weston
for
her
approbation
of
the
plan
mrs
weston
could
only
approve
isabella
then
went
to
emma
but
emma
could
not
so
entirely
give
up
the
hope
of
their
being
all
able
to
get
away
and
they
were
still
discussing
the
point
when
mr
knightley
who
had
left
the
room
immediately
after
his
brother
s
first
report
of
the
snow
came
back
again
and
told
them
that
he
had
been
out
of
doors
to
examine
and
could
answer
for
there
not
being
the
smallest
difficulty
in
their
getting
home
whenever
they
liked
it
either
now
or
an
hour
hence
he
had
gone
beyond
the
sweep
some
way
along
the
highbury
road
the
snow
was
nowhere
above
half
an
inch
deep
in
many
places
hardly
enough
to
whiten
the
ground
a
very
few
flakes
were
falling
at
present
but
the
clouds
were
parting
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
its
being
soon
over
he
had
seen
the
coachmen
and
they
both
agreed
with
him
in
there
being
nothing
to
apprehend
to
isabella
the
relief
of
such
tidings
was
very
great
and
they
were
scarcely
less
acceptable
to
emma
on
her
father
s
account
who
was
immediately
set
as
much
at
ease
on
the
subject
as
his
nervous
constitution
allowed
but
the
alarm
that
had
been
raised
could
not
be
appeased
so
as
to
admit
of
any
comfort
for
him
while
he
continued
at
randalls
he
was
satisfied
of
there
being
no
present
danger
in
returning
home
but
no
assurances
could
convince
him
that
it
was
safe
to
stay
and
while
the
others
were
variously
urging
and
recommending
mr
knightley
and
emma
settled
it
in
a
few
brief
sentences
thus
your
father
will
not
be
easy
why
do
not
you
go
i
am
ready
if
the
others
are
shall
i
ring
the
bell
yes
do
and
the
bell
was
rung
and
the
carriages
spoken
for
a
few
minutes
more
and
emma
hoped
to
see
one
troublesome
companion
deposited
in
his
own
house
to
get
sober
and
cool
and
the
other
recover
his
temper
and
happiness
when
this
visit
of
hardship
were
over
the
carriage
came
and
mr
woodhouse
always
the
first
object
on
such
occasions
was
carefully
attended
to
his
own
by
mr
knightley
and
mr
weston
but
not
all
that
either
could
say
could
prevent
some
renewal
of
alarm
at
the
sight
of
the
snow
which
had
actually
fallen
and
the
discovery
of
a
much
darker
night
than
he
had
been
prepared
for
he
was
afraid
they
should
have
a
very
bad
drive
he
was
afraid
poor
isabella
would
not
like
it
and
there
would
be
poor
emma
in
the
carriage
behind
he
did
not
know
what
they
had
best
do
they
must
keep
as
much
together
as
they
could
and
james
was
talked
to
and
given
a
charge
to
go
very
slow
and
wait
for
the
other
carriage
isabella
stept
in
after
her
father
john
knightley
forgetting
that
he
did
not
belong
to
their
party
stept
in
after
his
wife
very
naturally
so
that
emma
found
on
being
escorted
and
followed
into
the
second
carriage
by
mr
elton
that
the
door
was
to
be
lawfully
shut
on
them
and
that
they
were
to
have
a
tete
a
tete
drive
it
would
not
have
been
the
awkwardness
of
a
moment
it
would
have
been
rather
a
pleasure
previous
to
the
suspicions
of
this
very
day
she
could
have
talked
to
him
of
harriet
and
the
three
quarters
of
a
mile
would
have
seemed
but
one
but
now
she
would
rather
it
had
not
happened
she
believed
he
had
been
drinking
too
much
of
mr
weston
s
good
wine
and
felt
sure
that
he
would
want
to
be
talking
nonsense
to
restrain
him
as
much
as
might
be
by
her
own
manners
she
was
immediately
preparing
to
speak
with
exquisite
calmness
and
gravity
of
the
weather
and
the
night
but
scarcely
had
she
begun
scarcely
had
they
passed
the
sweep
gate
and
joined
the
other
carriage
than
she
found
her
subject
cut
up
her
hand
seized
her
attention
demanded
and
mr
elton
actually
making
violent
love
to
her
availing
himself
of
the
precious
opportunity
declaring
sentiments
which
must
be
already
well
known
hoping
fearing
adoring
ready
to
die
if
she
refused
him
but
flattering
himself
that
his
ardent
attachment
and
unequalled
love
and
unexampled
passion
could
not
fail
of
having
some
effect
and
in
short
very
much
resolved
on
being
seriously
accepted
as
soon
as
possible
it
really
was
so
without
scruple
without
apology
without
much
apparent
diffidence
mr
elton
the
lover
of
harriet
was
professing
himself
her
lover
she
tried
to
stop
him
but
vainly
he
would
go
on
and
say
it
all
angry
as
she
was
the
thought
of
the
moment
made
her
resolve
to
restrain
herself
when
she
did
speak
she
felt
that
half
this
folly
must
be
drunkenness
and
therefore
could
hope
that
it
might
belong
only
to
the
passing
hour
accordingly
with
a
mixture
of
the
serious
and
the
playful
which
she
hoped
would
best
suit
his
half
and
half
state
she
replied
i
am
very
much
astonished
mr
elton
this
to
me
you
forget
yourself
you
take
me
for
my
friend
any
message
to
miss
smith
i
shall
be
happy
to
deliver
but
no
more
of
this
to
me
if
you
please
miss
smith
message
to
miss
smith
what
could
she
possibly
mean
and
he
repeated
her
words
with
such
assurance
of
accent
such
boastful
pretence
of
amazement
that
she
could
not
help
replying
with
quickness
mr
elton
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
conduct
and
i
can
account
for
it
only
in
one
way
you
are
not
yourself
or
you
could
not
speak
either
to
me
or
of
harriet
in
such
a
manner
command
yourself
enough
to
say
no
more
and
i
will
endeavour
to
forget
it
but
mr
elton
had
only
drunk
wine
enough
to
elevate
his
spirits
not
at
all
to
confuse
his
intellects
he
perfectly
knew
his
own
meaning
and
having
warmly
protested
against
her
suspicion
as
most
injurious
and
slightly
touched
upon
his
respect
for
miss
smith
as
her
friend
but
acknowledging
his
wonder
that
miss
smith
should
be
mentioned
at
all
he
resumed
the
subject
of
his
own
passion
and
was
very
urgent
for
a
favourable
answer
as
she
thought
less
of
his
inebriety
she
thought
more
of
his
inconstancy
and
presumption
and
with
fewer
struggles
for
politeness
replied
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
doubt
any
longer
you
have
made
yourself
too
clear
mr
elton
my
astonishment
is
much
beyond
any
thing
i
can
express
after
such
behaviour
as
i
have
witnessed
during
the
last
month
to
miss
smith
such
attentions
as
i
have
been
in
the
daily
habit
of
observing
to
be
addressing
me
in
this
manner
this
is
an
unsteadiness
of
character
indeed
which
i
had
not
supposed
possible
believe
me
sir
i
am
far
very
far
from
gratified
in
being
the
object
of
such
professions
good
heaven
cried
mr
elton
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
miss
smith
i
never
thought
of
miss
smith
in
the
whole
course
of
my
existence
never
paid
her
any
attentions
but
as
your
friend
never
cared
whether
she
were
dead
or
alive
but
as
your
friend
if
she
has
fancied
otherwise
her
own
wishes
have
misled
her
and
i
am
very
sorry
extremely
sorry
but
miss
smith
indeed
oh
miss
woodhouse
who
can
think
of
miss
smith
when
miss
woodhouse
is
near
no
upon
my
honour
there
is
no
unsteadiness
of
character
i
have
thought
only
of
you
i
protest
against
having
paid
the
smallest
attention
to
any
one
else
every
thing
that
i
have
said
or
done
for
many
weeks
past
has
been
with
the
sole
view
of
marking
my
adoration
of
yourself
you
cannot
really
seriously
doubt
it
no
in
an
accent
meant
to
be
insinuating
i
am
sure
you
have
seen
and
understood
me
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
what
emma
felt
on
hearing
this
which
of
all
her
unpleasant
sensations
was
uppermost
she
was
too
completely
overpowered
to
be
immediately
able
to
reply
and
two
moments
of
silence
being
ample
encouragement
for
mr
elton
s
sanguine
state
of
mind
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
again
as
he
joyously
exclaimed
charming
miss
woodhouse
allow
me
to
interpret
this
interesting
silence
it
confesses
that
you
have
long
understood
me
no
sir
cried
emma
it
confesses
no
such
thing
so
far
from
having
long
understood
you
i
have
been
in
a
most
complete
error
with
respect
to
your
views
till
this
moment
as
to
myself
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
should
have
been
giving
way
to
any
feelings
nothing
could
be
farther
from
my
wishes
your
attachment
to
my
friend
harriet
your
pursuit
of
her
pursuit
it
appeared
gave
me
great
pleasure
and
i
have
been
very
earnestly
wishing
you
success
but
had
i
supposed
that
she
were
not
your
attraction
to
hartfield
i
should
certainly
have
thought
you
judged
ill
in
making
your
visits
so
frequent
am
i
to
believe
that
you
have
never
sought
to
recommend
yourself
particularly
to
miss
smith
that
you
have
never
thought
seriously
of
her
never
madam
cried
he
affronted
in
his
turn
never
i
assure
you
i
think
seriously
of
miss
smith
miss
smith
is
a
very
good
sort
of
girl
and
i
should
be
happy
to
see
her
respectably
settled
i
wish
her
extremely
well
and
no
doubt
there
are
men
who
might
not
object
to
every
body
has
their
level
but
as
for
myself
i
am
not
i
think
quite
so
much
at
a
loss
i
need
not
so
totally
despair
of
an
equal
alliance
as
to
be
addressing
myself
to
miss
smith
no
madam
my
visits
to
hartfield
have
been
for
yourself
only
and
the
encouragement
i
received
encouragement
i
give
you
encouragement
sir
you
have
been
entirely
mistaken
in
supposing
it
i
have
seen
you
only
as
the
admirer
of
my
friend
in
no
other
light
could
you
have
been
more
to
me
than
a
common
acquaintance
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
but
it
is
well
that
the
mistake
ends
where
it
does
had
the
same
behaviour
continued
miss
smith
might
have
been
led
into
a
misconception
of
your
views
not
being
aware
probably
any
more
than
myself
of
the
very
great
inequality
which
you
are
so
sensible
of
but
as
it
is
the
disappointment
is
single
and
i
trust
will
not
be
lasting
i
have
no
thoughts
of
matrimony
at
present
he
was
too
angry
to
say
another
word
her
manner
too
decided
to
invite
supplication
and
in
this
state
of
swelling
resentment
and
mutually
deep
mortification
they
had
to
continue
together
a
few
minutes
longer
for
the
fears
of
mr
woodhouse
had
confined
them
to
a
foot
pace
if
there
had
not
been
so
much
anger
there
would
have
been
desperate
awkwardness
but
their
straightforward
emotions
left
no
room
for
the
little
zigzags
of
embarrassment
without
knowing
when
the
carriage
turned
into
vicarage
lane
or
when
it
stopped
they
found
themselves
all
at
once
at
the
door
of
his
house
and
he
was
out
before
another
syllable
passed
emma
then
felt
it
indispensable
to
wish
him
a
good
night
the
compliment
was
just
returned
coldly
and
proudly
and
under
indescribable
irritation
of
spirits
she
was
then
conveyed
to
hartfield
there
she
was
welcomed
with
the
utmost
delight
by
her
father
who
had
been
trembling
for
the
dangers
of
a
solitary
drive
from
vicarage
lane
turning
a
corner
which
he
could
never
bear
to
think
of
and
in
strange
hands
a
mere
common
coachman
no
james
and
there
it
seemed
as
if
her
return
only
were
wanted
to
make
every
thing
go
well
for
mr
john
knightley
ashamed
of
his
ill
humour
was
now
all
kindness
and
attention
and
so
particularly
solicitous
for
the
comfort
of
her
father
as
to
seem
if
not
quite
ready
to
join
him
in
a
basin
of
gruel
perfectly
sensible
of
its
being
exceedingly
wholesome
and
the
day
was
concluding
in
peace
and
comfort
to
all
their
little
party
except
herself
but
her
mind
had
never
been
in
such
perturbation
and
it
needed
a
very
strong
effort
to
appear
attentive
and
cheerful
till
the
usual
hour
of
separating
allowed
her
the
relief
of
quiet
reflection
chapter
xvi
the
hair
was
curled
and
the
maid
sent
away
and
emma
sat
down
to
think
and
be
miserable
it
was
a
wretched
business
indeed
such
an
overthrow
of
every
thing
she
had
been
wishing
for
such
a
development
of
every
thing
most
unwelcome
such
a
blow
for
harriet
that
was
the
worst
of
all
every
part
of
it
brought
pain
and
humiliation
of
some
sort
or
other
but
compared
with
the
evil
to
harriet
all
was
light
and
she
would
gladly
have
submitted
to
feel
yet
more
mistaken
more
in
error
more
disgraced
by
mis
judgment
than
she
actually
was
could
the
effects
of
her
blunders
have
been
confined
to
herself
if
i
had
not
persuaded
harriet
into
liking
the
man
i
could
have
borne
any
thing
he
might
have
doubled
his
presumption
to
me
but
poor
harriet
how
she
could
have
been
so
deceived
he
protested
that
he
had
never
thought
seriously
of
harriet
never
she
looked
back
as
well
as
she
could
but
it
was
all
confusion
she
had
taken
up
the
idea
she
supposed
and
made
every
thing
bend
to
it
his
manners
however
must
have
been
unmarked
wavering
dubious
or
she
could
not
have
been
so
misled
the
picture
how
eager
he
had
been
about
the
picture
and
the
charade
and
an
hundred
other
circumstances
how
clearly
they
had
seemed
to
point
at
harriet
to
be
sure
the
charade
with
its
ready
wit
but
then
the
soft
eyes
in
fact
it
suited
neither
it
was
a
jumble
without
taste
or
truth
who
could
have
seen
through
such
thick
headed
nonsense
certainly
she
had
often
especially
of
late
thought
his
manners
to
herself
unnecessarily
gallant
but
it
had
passed
as
his
way
as
a
mere
error
of
judgment
of
knowledge
of
taste
as
one
proof
among
others
that
he
had
not
always
lived
in
the
best
society
that
with
all
the
gentleness
of
his
address
true
elegance
was
sometimes
wanting
but
till
this
very
day
she
had
never
for
an
instant
suspected
it
to
mean
any
thing
but
grateful
respect
to
her
as
harriet
s
friend
to
mr
john
knightley
was
she
indebted
for
her
first
idea
on
the
subject
for
the
first
start
of
its
possibility
there
was
no
denying
that
those
brothers
had
penetration
she
remembered
what
mr
knightley
had
once
said
to
her
about
mr
elton
the
caution
he
had
given
the
conviction
he
had
professed
that
mr
elton
would
never
marry
indiscreetly
and
blushed
to
think
how
much
truer
a
knowledge
of
his
character
had
been
there
shewn
than
any
she
had
reached
herself
it
was
dreadfully
mortifying
but
mr
elton
was
proving
himself
in
many
respects
the
very
reverse
of
what
she
had
meant
and
believed
him
proud
assuming
conceited
very
full
of
his
own
claims
and
little
concerned
about
the
feelings
of
others
contrary
to
the
usual
course
of
things
mr
elton
s
wanting
to
pay
his
addresses
to
her
had
sunk
him
in
her
opinion
his
professions
and
his
proposals
did
him
no
service
she
thought
nothing
of
his
attachment
and
was
insulted
by
his
hopes
he
wanted
to
marry
well
and
having
the
arrogance
to
raise
his
eyes
to
her
pretended
to
be
in
love
but
she
was
perfectly
easy
as
to
his
not
suffering
any
disappointment
that
need
be
cared
for
there
had
been
no
real
affection
either
in
his
language
or
manners
sighs
and
fine
words
had
been
given
in
abundance
but
she
could
hardly
devise
any
set
of
expressions
or
fancy
any
tone
of
voice
less
allied
with
real
love
she
need
not
trouble
herself
to
pity
him
he
only
wanted
to
aggrandise
and
enrich
himself
and
if
miss
woodhouse
of
hartfield
the
heiress
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
were
not
quite
so
easily
obtained
as
he
had
fancied
he
would
soon
try
for
miss
somebody
else
with
twenty
or
with
ten
but
that
he
should
talk
of
encouragement
should
consider
her
as
aware
of
his
views
accepting
his
attentions
meaning
in
short
to
marry
him
should
suppose
himself
her
equal
in
connexion
or
mind
look
down
upon
her
friend
so
well
understanding
the
gradations
of
rank
below
him
and
be
so
blind
to
what
rose
above
as
to
fancy
himself
shewing
no
presumption
in
addressing
her
it
was
most
provoking
perhaps
it
was
not
fair
to
expect
him
to
feel
how
very
much
he
was
her
inferior
in
talent
and
all
the
elegancies
of
mind
the
very
want
of
such
equality
might
prevent
his
perception
of
it
but
he
must
know
that
in
fortune
and
consequence
she
was
greatly
his
superior
he
must
know
that
the
woodhouses
had
been
settled
for
several
generations
at
hartfield
the
younger
branch
of
a
very
ancient
family
and
that
the
eltons
were
nobody
the
landed
property
of
hartfield
certainly
was
inconsiderable
being
but
a
sort
of
notch
in
the
donwell
abbey
estate
to
which
all
the
rest
of
highbury
belonged
but
their
fortune
from
other
sources
was
such
as
to
make
them
scarcely
secondary
to
donwell
abbey
itself
in
every
other
kind
of
consequence
and
the
woodhouses
had
long
held
a
high
place
in
the
consideration
of
the
neighbourhood
which
mr
elton
had
first
entered
not
two
years
ago
to
make
his
way
as
he
could
without
any
alliances
but
in
trade
or
any
thing
to
recommend
him
to
notice
but
his
situation
and
his
civility
but
he
had
fancied
her
in
love
with
him
that
evidently
must
have
been
his
dependence
and
after
raving
a
little
about
the
seeming
incongruity
of
gentle
manners
and
a
conceited
head
emma
was
obliged
in
common
honesty
to
stop
and
admit
that
her
own
behaviour
to
him
had
been
so
complaisant
and
obliging
so
full
of
courtesy
and
attention
as
supposing
her
real
motive
unperceived
might
warrant
a
man
of
ordinary
observation
and
delicacy
like
mr
elton
in
fancying
himself
a
very
decided
favourite
if
she
had
so
misinterpreted
his
feelings
she
had
little
right
to
wonder
that
he
with
self
interest
to
blind
him
should
have
mistaken
hers
the
first
error
and
the
worst
lay
at
her
door
it
was
foolish
it
was
wrong
to
take
so
active
a
part
in
bringing
any
two
people
together
it
was
adventuring
too
far
assuming
too
much
making
light
of
what
ought
to
be
serious
a
trick
of
what
ought
to
be
simple
she
was
quite
concerned
and
ashamed
and
resolved
to
do
such
things
no
more
here
have
i
said
she
actually
talked
poor
harriet
into
being
very
much
attached
to
this
man
she
might
never
have
thought
of
him
but
for
me
and
certainly
never
would
have
thought
of
him
with
hope
if
i
had
not
assured
her
of
his
attachment
for
she
is
as
modest
and
humble
as
i
used
to
think
him
oh
that
i
had
been
satisfied
with
persuading
her
not
to
accept
young
martin
there
i
was
quite
right
that
was
well
done
of
me
but
there
i
should
have
stopped
and
left
the
rest
to
time
and
chance
i
was
introducing
her
into
good
company
and
giving
her
the
opportunity
of
pleasing
some
one
worth
having
i
ought
not
to
have
attempted
more
but
now
poor
girl
her
peace
is
cut
up
for
some
time
i
have
been
but
half
a
friend
to
her
and
if
she
were
not
to
feel
this
disappointment
so
very
much
i
am
sure
i
have
not
an
idea
of
any
body
else
who
would
be
at
all
desirable
for
her
william
coxe
oh
no
i
could
not
endure
william
coxe
a
pert
young
lawyer
she
stopt
to
blush
and
laugh
at
her
own
relapse
and
then
resumed
a
more
serious
more
dispiriting
cogitation
upon
what
had
been
and
might
be
and
must
be
the
distressing
explanation
she
had
to
make
to
harriet
and
all
that
poor
harriet
would
be
suffering
with
the
awkwardness
of
future
meetings
the
difficulties
of
continuing
or
discontinuing
the
acquaintance
of
subduing
feelings
concealing
resentment
and
avoiding
eclat
were
enough
to
occupy
her
in
most
unmirthful
reflections
some
time
longer
and
she
went
to
bed
at
last
with
nothing
settled
but
the
conviction
of
her
having
blundered
most
dreadfully
to
youth
and
natural
cheerfulness
like
emma
s
though
under
temporary
gloom
at
night
the
return
of
day
will
hardly
fail
to
bring
return
of
spirits
the
youth
and
cheerfulness
of
morning
are
in
happy
analogy
and
of
powerful
operation
and
if
the
distress
be
not
poignant
enough
to
keep
the
eyes
unclosed
they
will
be
sure
to
open
to
sensations
of
softened
pain
and
brighter
hope
emma
got
up
on
the
morrow
more
disposed
for
comfort
than
she
had
gone
to
bed
more
ready
to
see
alleviations
of
the
evil
before
her
and
to
depend
on
getting
tolerably
out
of
it
it
was
a
great
consolation
that
mr
elton
should
not
be
really
in
love
with
her
or
so
particularly
amiable
as
to
make
it
shocking
to
disappoint
him
that
harriet
s
nature
should
not
be
of
that
superior
sort
in
which
the
feelings
are
most
acute
and
retentive
and
that
there
could
be
no
necessity
for
any
body
s
knowing
what
had
passed
except
the
three
principals
and
especially
for
her
father
s
being
given
a
moment
s
uneasiness
about
it
these
were
very
cheering
thoughts
and
the
sight
of
a
great
deal
of
snow
on
the
ground
did
her
further
service
for
any
thing
was
welcome
that
might
justify
their
all
three
being
quite
asunder
at
present
the
weather
was
most
favourable
for
her
though
christmas
day
she
could
not
go
to
church
mr
woodhouse
would
have
been
miserable
had
his
daughter
attempted
it
and
she
was
therefore
safe
from
either
exciting
or
receiving
unpleasant
and
most
unsuitable
ideas
the
ground
covered
with
snow
and
the
atmosphere
in
that
unsettled
state
between
frost
and
thaw
which
is
of
all
others
the
most
unfriendly
for
exercise
every
morning
beginning
in
rain
or
snow
and
every
evening
setting
in
to
freeze
she
was
for
many
days
a
most
honourable
prisoner
no
intercourse
with
harriet
possible
but
by
note
no
church
for
her
on
sunday
any
more
than
on
christmas
day
and
no
need
to
find
excuses
for
mr
elton
s
absenting
himself
it
was
weather
which
might
fairly
confine
every
body
at
home
and
though
she
hoped
and
believed
him
to
be
really
taking
comfort
in
some
society
or
other
it
was
very
pleasant
to
have
her
father
so
well
satisfied
with
his
being
all
alone
in
his
own
house
too
wise
to
stir
out
and
to
hear
him
say
to
mr
knightley
whom
no
weather
could
keep
entirely
from
them
ah
mr
knightley
why
do
not
you
stay
at
home
like
poor
mr
elton
these
days
of
confinement
would
have
been
but
for
her
private
perplexities
remarkably
comfortable
as
such
seclusion
exactly
suited
her
brother
whose
feelings
must
always
be
of
great
importance
to
his
companions
and
he
had
besides
so
thoroughly
cleared
off
his
ill
humour
at
randalls
that
his
amiableness
never
failed
him
during
the
rest
of
his
stay
at
hartfield
he
was
always
agreeable
and
obliging
and
speaking
pleasantly
of
every
body
but
with
all
the
hopes
of
cheerfulness
and
all
the
present
comfort
of
delay
there
was
still
such
an
evil
hanging
over
her
in
the
hour
of
explanation
with
harriet
as
made
it
impossible
for
emma
to
be
ever
perfectly
at
ease
chapter
xvii
mr
and
mrs
john
knightley
were
not
detained
long
at
hartfield
the
weather
soon
improved
enough
for
those
to
move
who
must
move
and
mr
woodhouse
having
as
usual
tried
to
persuade
his
daughter
to
stay
behind
with
all
her
children
was
obliged
to
see
the
whole
party
set
off
and
return
to
his
lamentations
over
the
destiny
of
poor
isabella
which
poor
isabella
passing
her
life
with
those
she
doated
on
full
of
their
merits
blind
to
their
faults
and
always
innocently
busy
might
have
been
a
model
of
right
feminine
happiness
the
evening
of
the
very
day
on
which
they
went
brought
a
note
from
mr
elton
to
mr
woodhouse
a
long
civil
ceremonious
note
to
say
with
mr
elton
s
best
compliments
that
he
was
proposing
to
leave
highbury
the
following
morning
in
his
way
to
bath
where
in
compliance
with
the
pressing
entreaties
of
some
friends
he
had
engaged
to
spend
a
few
weeks
and
very
much
regretted
the
impossibility
he
was
under
from
various
circumstances
of
weather
and
business
of
taking
a
personal
leave
of
mr
woodhouse
of
whose
friendly
civilities
he
should
ever
retain
a
grateful
sense
and
had
mr
woodhouse
any
commands
should
be
happy
to
attend
to
them
emma
was
most
agreeably
surprized
mr
elton
s
absence
just
at
this
time
was
the
very
thing
to
be
desired
she
admired
him
for
contriving
it
though
not
able
to
give
him
much
credit
for
the
manner
in
which
it
was
announced
resentment
could
not
have
been
more
plainly
spoken
than
in
a
civility
to
her
father
from
which
she
was
so
pointedly
excluded
she
had
not
even
a
share
in
his
opening
compliments
her
name
was
not
mentioned
and
there
was
so
striking
a
change
in
all
this
and
such
an
ill
judged
solemnity
of
leave
taking
in
his
graceful
acknowledgments
as
she
thought
at
first
could
not
escape
her
father
s
suspicion
it
did
however
her
father
was
quite
taken
up
with
the
surprize
of
so
sudden
a
journey
and
his
fears
that
mr
elton
might
never
get
safely
to
the
end
of
it
and
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
language
it
was
a
very
useful
note
for
it
supplied
them
with
fresh
matter
for
thought
and
conversation
during
the
rest
of
their
lonely
evening
mr
woodhouse
talked
over
his
alarms
and
emma
was
in
spirits
to
persuade
them
away
with
all
her
usual
promptitude
she
now
resolved
to
keep
harriet
no
longer
in
the
dark
she
had
reason
to
believe
her
nearly
recovered
from
her
cold
and
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
have
as
much
time
as
possible
for
getting
the
better
of
her
other
complaint
before
the
gentleman
s
return
she
went
to
mrs
goddard
s
accordingly
the
very
next
day
to
undergo
the
necessary
penance
of
communication
and
a
severe
one
it
was
she
had
to
destroy
all
the
hopes
which
she
had
been
so
industriously
feeding
to
appear
in
the
ungracious
character
of
the
one
preferred
and
acknowledge
herself
grossly
mistaken
and
mis
judging
in
all
her
ideas
on
one
subject
all
her
observations
all
her
convictions
all
her
prophecies
for
the
last
six
weeks
the
confession
completely
renewed
her
first
shame
and
the
sight
of
harriet
s
tears
made
her
think
that
she
should
never
be
in
charity
with
herself
again
harriet
bore
the
intelligence
very
well
blaming
nobody
and
in
every
thing
testifying
such
an
ingenuousness
of
disposition
and
lowly
opinion
of
herself
as
must
appear
with
particular
advantage
at
that
moment
to
her
friend
emma
was
in
the
humour
to
value
simplicity
and
modesty
to
the
utmost
and
all
that
was
amiable
all
that
ought
to
be
attaching
seemed
on
harriet
s
side
not
her
own
harriet
did
not
consider
herself
as
having
any
thing
to
complain
of
the
affection
of
such
a
man
as
mr
elton
would
have
been
too
great
a
distinction
she
never
could
have
deserved
him
and
nobody
but
so
partial
and
kind
a
friend
as
miss
woodhouse
would
have
thought
it
possible
her
tears
fell
abundantly
but
her
grief
was
so
truly
artless
that
no
dignity
could
have
made
it
more
respectable
in
emma
s
eyes
and
she
listened
to
her
and
tried
to
console
her
with
all
her
heart
and
understanding
really
for
the
time
convinced
that
harriet
was
the
superior
creature
of
the
two
and
that
to
resemble
her
would
be
more
for
her
own
welfare
and
happiness
than
all
that
genius
or
intelligence
could
do
it
was
rather
too
late
in
the
day
to
set
about
being
simple
minded
and
ignorant
but
she
left
her
with
every
previous
resolution
confirmed
of
being
humble
and
discreet
and
repressing
imagination
all
the
rest
of
her
life
her
second
duty
now
inferior
only
to
her
father
s
claims
was
to
promote
harriet
s
comfort
and
endeavour
to
prove
her
own
affection
in
some
better
method
than
by
match
making
she
got
her
to
hartfield
and
shewed
her
the
most
unvarying
kindness
striving
to
occupy
and
amuse
her
and
by
books
and
conversation
to
drive
mr
elton
from
her
thoughts
time
she
knew
must
be
allowed
for
this
being
thoroughly
done
and
she
could
suppose
herself
but
an
indifferent
judge
of
such
matters
in
general
and
very
inadequate
to
sympathise
in
an
attachment
to
mr
elton
in
particular
but
it
seemed
to
her
reasonable
that
at
harriet
s
age
and
with
the
entire
extinction
of
all
hope
such
a
progress
might
be
made
towards
a
state
of
composure
by
the
time
of
mr
elton
s
return
as
to
allow
them
all
to
meet
again
in
the
common
routine
of
acquaintance
without
any
danger
of
betraying
sentiments
or
increasing
them
harriet
did
think
him
all
perfection
and
maintained
the
non
existence
of
any
body
equal
to
him
in
person
or
goodness
and
did
in
truth
prove
herself
more
resolutely
in
love
than
emma
had
foreseen
but
yet
it
appeared
to
her
so
natural
so
inevitable
to
strive
against
an
inclination
of
that
sort
unrequited
that
she
could
not
comprehend
its
continuing
very
long
in
equal
force
if
mr
elton
on
his
return
made
his
own
indifference
as
evident
and
indubitable
as
she
could
not
doubt
he
would
anxiously
do
she
could
not
imagine
harriet
s
persisting
to
place
her
happiness
in
the
sight
or
the
recollection
of
him
their
being
fixed
so
absolutely
fixed
in
the
same
place
was
bad
for
each
for
all
three
not
one
of
them
had
the
power
of
removal
or
of
effecting
any
material
change
of
society
they
must
encounter
each
other
and
make
the
best
of
it
harriet
was
farther
unfortunate
in
the
tone
of
her
companions
at
mrs
goddard
s
mr
elton
being
the
adoration
of
all
the
teachers
and
great
girls
in
the
school
and
it
must
be
at
hartfield
only
that
she
could
have
any
chance
of
hearing
him
spoken
of
with
cooling
moderation
or
repellent
truth
where
the
wound
had
been
given
there
must
the
cure
be
found
if
anywhere
and
emma
felt
that
till
she
saw
her
in
the
way
of
cure
there
could
be
no
true
peace
for
herself
chapter
xviii
mr
frank
churchill
did
not
come
when
the
time
proposed
drew
near
mrs
weston
s
fears
were
justified
in
the
arrival
of
a
letter
of
excuse
for
the
present
he
could
not
be
spared
to
his
very
great
mortification
and
regret
but
still
he
looked
forward
with
the
hope
of
coming
to
randalls
at
no
distant
period
mrs
weston
was
exceedingly
disappointed
much
more
disappointed
in
fact
than
her
husband
though
her
dependence
on
seeing
the
young
man
had
been
so
much
more
sober
but
a
sanguine
temper
though
for
ever
expecting
more
good
than
occurs
does
not
always
pay
for
its
hopes
by
any
proportionate
depression
it
soon
flies
over
the
present
failure
and
begins
to
hope
again
for
half
an
hour
mr
weston
was
surprized
and
sorry
but
then
he
began
to
perceive
that
frank
s
coming
two
or
three
months
later
would
be
a
much
better
plan
better
time
of
year
better
weather
and
that
he
would
be
able
without
any
doubt
to
stay
considerably
longer
with
them
than
if
he
had
come
sooner
these
feelings
rapidly
restored
his
comfort
while
mrs
weston
of
a
more
apprehensive
disposition
foresaw
nothing
but
a
repetition
of
excuses
and
delays
and
after
all
her
concern
for
what
her
husband
was
to
suffer
suffered
a
great
deal
more
herself
emma
was
not
at
this
time
in
a
state
of
spirits
to
care
really
about
mr
frank
churchill
s
not
coming
except
as
a
disappointment
at
randalls
the
acquaintance
at
present
had
no
charm
for
her
she
wanted
rather
to
be
quiet
and
out
of
temptation
but
still
as
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
appear
in
general
like
her
usual
self
she
took
care
to
express
as
much
interest
in
the
circumstance
and
enter
as
warmly
into
mr
and
mrs
weston
s
disappointment
as
might
naturally
belong
to
their
friendship
she
was
the
first
to
announce
it
to
mr
knightley
and
exclaimed
quite
as
much
as
was
necessary
or
being
acting
a
part
perhaps
rather
more
at
the
conduct
of
the
churchills
in
keeping
him
away
she
then
proceeded
to
say
a
good
deal
more
than
she
felt
of
the
advantage
of
such
an
addition
to
their
confined
society
in
surry
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
somebody
new
the
gala
day
to
highbury
entire
which
the
sight
of
him
would
have
made
and
ending
with
reflections
on
the
churchills
again
found
herself
directly
involved
in
a
disagreement
with
mr
knightley
and
to
her
great
amusement
perceived
that
she
was
taking
the
other
side
of
the
question
from
her
real
opinion
and
making
use
of
mrs
weston
s
arguments
against
herself
the
churchills
are
very
likely
in
fault
said
mr
knightley
coolly
but
i
dare
say
he
might
come
if
he
would
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
say
so
he
wishes
exceedingly
to
come
but
his
uncle
and
aunt
will
not
spare
him
i
cannot
believe
that
he
has
not
the
power
of
coming
if
he
made
a
point
of
it
it
is
too
unlikely
for
me
to
believe
it
without
proof
how
odd
you
are
what
has
mr
frank
churchill
done
to
make
you
suppose
him
such
an
unnatural
creature
i
am
not
supposing
him
at
all
an
unnatural
creature
in
suspecting
that
he
may
have
learnt
to
be
above
his
connexions
and
to
care
very
little
for
any
thing
but
his
own
pleasure
from
living
with
those
who
have
always
set
him
the
example
of
it
it
is
a
great
deal
more
natural
than
one
could
wish
that
a
young
man
brought
up
by
those
who
are
proud
luxurious
and
selfish
should
be
proud
luxurious
and
selfish
too
if
frank
churchill
had
wanted
to
see
his
father
he
would
have
contrived
it
between
september
and
january
a
man
at
his
age
what
is
he
three
or
four
and
twenty
cannot
be
without
the
means
of
doing
as
much
as
that
it
is
impossible
that
s
easily
said
and
easily
felt
by
you
who
have
always
been
your
own
master
you
are
the
worst
judge
in
the
world
mr
knightley
of
the
difficulties
of
dependence
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
tempers
to
manage
it
is
not
to
be
conceived
that
a
man
of
three
or
four
and
twenty
should
not
have
liberty
of
mind
or
limb
to
that
amount
he
cannot
want
money
he
cannot
want
leisure
we
know
on
the
contrary
that
he
has
so
much
of
both
that
he
is
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
at
the
idlest
haunts
in
the
kingdom
we
hear
of
him
for
ever
at
some
watering
place
or
other
a
little
while
ago
he
was
at
weymouth
this
proves
that
he
can
leave
the
churchills
yes
sometimes
he
can
and
those
times
are
whenever
he
thinks
it
worth
his
while
whenever
there
is
any
temptation
of
pleasure
it
is
very
unfair
to
judge
of
any
body
s
conduct
without
an
intimate
knowledge
of
their
situation
nobody
who
has
not
been
in
the
interior
of
a
family
can
say
what
the
difficulties
of
any
individual
of
that
family
may
be
we
ought
to
be
acquainted
with
enscombe
and
with
mrs
churchill
s
temper
before
we
pretend
to
decide
upon
what
her
nephew
can
do
he
may
at
times
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
more
than
he
can
at
others
there
is
one
thing
emma
which
a
man
can
always
do
if
he
chuses
and
that
is
his
duty
not
by
manoeuvring
and
finessing
but
by
vigour
and
resolution
it
is
frank
churchill
s
duty
to
pay
this
attention
to
his
father
he
knows
it
to
be
so
by
his
promises
and
messages
but
if
he
wished
to
do
it
it
might
be
done
a
man
who
felt
rightly
would
say
at
once
simply
and
resolutely
to
mrs
churchill
every
sacrifice
of
mere
pleasure
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
make
to
your
convenience
but
i
must
go
and
see
my
father
immediately
i
know
he
would
be
hurt
by
my
failing
in
such
a
mark
of
respect
to
him
on
the
present
occasion
i
shall
therefore
set
off
to
morrow
if
he
would
say
so
to
her
at
once
in
the
tone
of
decision
becoming
a
man
there
would
be
no
opposition
made
to
his
going
no
said
emma
laughing
but
perhaps
there
might
be
some
made
to
his
coming
back
again
such
language
for
a
young
man
entirely
dependent
to
use
nobody
but
you
mr
knightley
would
imagine
it
possible
but
you
have
not
an
idea
of
what
is
requisite
in
situations
directly
opposite
to
your
own
mr
frank
churchill
to
be
making
such
a
speech
as
that
to
the
uncle
and
aunt
who
have
brought
him
up
and
are
to
provide
for
him
standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
suppose
and
speaking
as
loud
as
he
could
how
can
you
imagine
such
conduct
practicable
depend
upon
it
emma
a
sensible
man
would
find
no
difficulty
in
it
he
would
feel
himself
in
the
right
and
the
declaration
made
of
course
as
a
man
of
sense
would
make
it
in
a
proper
manner
would
do
him
more
good
raise
him
higher
fix
his
interest
stronger
with
the
people
he
depended
on
than
all
that
a
line
of
shifts
and
expedients
can
ever
do
respect
would
be
added
to
affection
they
would
feel
that
they
could
trust
him
that
the
nephew
who
had
done
rightly
by
his
father
would
do
rightly
by
them
for
they
know
as
well
as
he
does
as
well
as
all
the
world
must
know
that
he
ought
to
pay
this
visit
to
his
father
and
while
meanly
exerting
their
power
to
delay
it
are
in
their
hearts
not
thinking
the
better
of
him
for
submitting
to
their
whims
respect
for
right
conduct
is
felt
by
every
body
if
he
would
act
in
this
sort
of
manner
on
principle
consistently
regularly
their
little
minds
would
bend
to
his
i
rather
doubt
that
you
are
very
fond
of
bending
little
minds
but
where
little
minds
belong
to
rich
people
in
authority
i
think
they
have
a
knack
of
swelling
out
till
they
are
quite
as
unmanageable
as
great
ones
i
can
imagine
that
if
you
as
you
are
mr
knightley
were
to
be
transported
and
placed
all
at
once
in
mr
frank
churchill
s
situation
you
would
be
able
to
say
and
do
just
what
you
have
been
recommending
for
him
and
it
might
have
a
very
good
effect
the
churchills
might
not
have
a
word
to
say
in
return
but
then
you
would
have
no
habits
of
early
obedience
and
long
observance
to
break
through
to
him
who
has
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
burst
forth
at
once
into
perfect
independence
and
set
all
their
claims
on
his
gratitude
and
regard
at
nought
he
may
have
as
strong
a
sense
of
what
would
be
right
as
you
can
have
without
being
so
equal
under
particular
circumstances
to
act
up
to
it
then
it
would
not
be
so
strong
a
sense
if
it
failed
to
produce
equal
exertion
it
could
not
be
an
equal
conviction
oh
the
difference
of
situation
and
habit
i
wish
you
would
try
to
understand
what
an
amiable
young
man
may
be
likely
to
feel
in
directly
opposing
those
whom
as
child
and
boy
he
has
been
looking
up
to
all
his
life
our
amiable
young
man
is
a
very
weak
young
man
if
this
be
the
first
occasion
of
his
carrying
through
a
resolution
to
do
right
against
the
will
of
others
it
ought
to
have
been
a
habit
with
him
by
this
time
of
following
his
duty
instead
of
consulting
expediency
i
can
allow
for
the
fears
of
the
child
but
not
of
the
man
as
he
became
rational
he
ought
to
have
roused
himself
and
shaken
off
all
that
was
unworthy
in
their
authority
he
ought
to
have
opposed
the
first
attempt
on
their
side
to
make
him
slight
his
father
had
he
begun
as
he
ought
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
now
we
shall
never
agree
about
him
cried
emma
but
that
is
nothing
extraordinary
i
have
not
the
least
idea
of
his
being
a
weak
young
man
i
feel
sure
that
he
is
not
mr
weston
would
not
be
blind
to
folly
though
in
his
own
son
but
he
is
very
likely
to
have
a
more
yielding
complying
mild
disposition
than
would
suit
your
notions
of
man
s
perfection
i
dare
say
he
has
and
though
it
may
cut
him
off
from
some
advantages
it
will
secure
him
many
others
yes
all
the
advantages
of
sitting
still
when
he
ought
to
move
and
of
leading
a
life
of
mere
idle
pleasure
and
fancying
himself
extremely
expert
in
finding
excuses
for
it
he
can
sit
down
and
write
a
fine
flourishing
letter
full
of
professions
and
falsehoods
and
persuade
himself
that
he
has
hit
upon
the
very
best
method
in
the
world
of
preserving
peace
at
home
and
preventing
his
father
s
having
any
right
to
complain
his
letters
disgust
me
your
feelings
are
singular
they
seem
to
satisfy
every
body
else
i
suspect
they
do
not
satisfy
mrs
weston
they
hardly
can
satisfy
a
woman
of
her
good
sense
and
quick
feelings
standing
in
a
mother
s
place
but
without
a
mother
s
affection
to
blind
her
it
is
on
her
account
that
attention
to
randalls
is
doubly
due
and
she
must
doubly
feel
the
omission
had
she
been
a
person
of
consequence
herself
he
would
have
come
i
dare
say
and
it
would
not
have
signified
whether
he
did
or
no
can
you
think
your
friend
behindhand
in
these
sort
of
considerations
do
you
suppose
she
does
not
often
say
all
this
to
herself
no
emma
your
amiable
young
man
can
be
amiable
only
in
french
not
in
english
he
may
be
very
amiable
have
very
good
manners
and
be
very
agreeable
but
he
can
have
no
english
delicacy
towards
the
feelings
of
other
people
nothing
really
amiable
about
him
you
seem
determined
to
think
ill
of
him
me
not
at
all
replied
mr
knightley
rather
displeased
i
do
not
want
to
think
ill
of
him
i
should
be
as
ready
to
acknowledge
his
merits
as
any
other
man
but
i
hear
of
none
except
what
are
merely
personal
that
he
is
well
grown
and
good
looking
with
smooth
plausible
manners
well
if
he
have
nothing
else
to
recommend
him
he
will
be
a
treasure
at
highbury
we
do
not
often
look
upon
fine
young
men
well
bred
and
agreeable
we
must
not
be
nice
and
ask
for
all
the
virtues
into
the
bargain
cannot
you
imagine
mr
knightley
what
a
sensation
his
coming
will
produce
there
will
be
but
one
subject
throughout
the
parishes
of
donwell
and
highbury
but
one
interest
one
object
of
curiosity
it
will
be
all
mr
frank
churchill
we
shall
think
and
speak
of
nobody
else
you
will
excuse
my
being
so
much
over
powered
if
i
find
him
conversable
i
shall
be
glad
of
his
acquaintance
but
if
he
is
only
a
chattering
coxcomb
he
will
not
occupy
much
of
my
time
or
thoughts
my
idea
of
him
is
that
he
can
adapt
his
conversation
to
the
taste
of
every
body
and
has
the
power
as
well
as
the
wish
of
being
universally
agreeable
to
you
he
will
talk
of
farming
to
me
of
drawing
or
music
and
so
on
to
every
body
having
that
general
information
on
all
subjects
which
will
enable
him
to
follow
the
lead
or
take
the
lead
just
as
propriety
may
require
and
to
speak
extremely
well
on
each
that
is
my
idea
of
him
and
mine
said
mr
knightley
warmly
is
that
if
he
turn
out
any
thing
like
it
he
will
be
the
most
insufferable
fellow
breathing
what
at
three
and
twenty
to
be
the
king
of
his
company
the
great
man
the
practised
politician
who
is
to
read
every
body
s
character
and
make
every
body
s
talents
conduce
to
the
display
of
his
own
superiority
to
be
dispensing
his
flatteries
around
that
he
may
make
all
appear
like
fools
compared
with
himself
my
dear
emma
your
own
good
sense
could
not
endure
such
a
puppy
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
will
say
no
more
about
him
cried
emma
you
turn
every
thing
to
evil
we
are
both
prejudiced
you
against
i
for
him
and
we
have
no
chance
of
agreeing
till
he
is
really
here
prejudiced
i
am
not
prejudiced
but
i
am
very
much
and
without
being
at
all
ashamed
of
it
my
love
for
mr
and
mrs
weston
gives
me
a
decided
prejudice
in
his
favour
he
is
a
person
i
never
think
of
from
one
month
s
end
to
another
said
mr
knightley
with
a
degree
of
vexation
which
made
emma
immediately
talk
of
something
else
though
she
could
not
comprehend
why
he
should
be
angry
to
take
a
dislike
to
a
young
man
only
because
he
appeared
to
be
of
a
different
disposition
from
himself
was
unworthy
the
real
liberality
of
mind
which
she
was
always
used
to
acknowledge
in
him
for
with
all
the
high
opinion
of
himself
which
she
had
often
laid
to
his
charge
she
had
never
before
for
a
moment
supposed
it
could
make
him
unjust
to
the
merit
of
another
volume
ii
chapter
i
emma
and
harriet
had
been
walking
together
one
morning
and
in
emma
s
opinion
had
been
talking
enough
of
mr
elton
for
that
day
she
could
not
think
that
harriet
s
solace
or
her
own
sins
required
more
and
she
was
therefore
industriously
getting
rid
of
the
subject
as
they
returned
but
it
burst
out
again
when
she
thought
she
had
succeeded
and
after
speaking
some
time
of
what
the
poor
must
suffer
in
winter
and
receiving
no
other
answer
than
a
very
plaintive
mr
elton
is
so
good
to
the
poor
she
found
something
else
must
be
done
they
were
just
approaching
the
house
where
lived
mrs
and
miss
bates
she
determined
to
call
upon
them
and
seek
safety
in
numbers
there
was
always
sufficient
reason
for
such
an
attention
mrs
and
miss
bates
loved
to
be
called
on
and
she
knew
she
was
considered
by
the
very
few
who
presumed
ever
to
see
imperfection
in
her
as
rather
negligent
in
that
respect
and
as
not
contributing
what
she
ought
to
the
stock
of
their
scanty
comforts
she
had
had
many
a
hint
from
mr
knightley
and
some
from
her
own
heart
as
to
her
deficiency
but
none
were
equal
to
counteract
the
persuasion
of
its
being
very
disagreeable
a
waste
of
time
tiresome
women
and
all
the
horror
of
being
in
danger
of
falling
in
with
the
second
rate
and
third
rate
of
highbury
who
were
calling
on
them
for
ever
and
therefore
she
seldom
went
near
them
but
now
she
made
the
sudden
resolution
of
not
passing
their
door
without
going
in
observing
as
she
proposed
it
to
harriet
that
as
well
as
she
could
calculate
they
were
just
now
quite
safe
from
any
letter
from
jane
fairfax
the
house
belonged
to
people
in
business
mrs
and
miss
bates
occupied
the
drawing
room
floor
and
there
in
the
very
moderate
sized
apartment
which
was
every
thing
to
them
the
visitors
were
most
cordially
and
even
gratefully
welcomed
the
quiet
neat
old
lady
who
with
her
knitting
was
seated
in
the
warmest
corner
wanting
even
to
give
up
her
place
to
miss
woodhouse
and
her
more
active
talking
daughter
almost
ready
to
overpower
them
with
care
and
kindness
thanks
for
their
visit
solicitude
for
their
shoes
anxious
inquiries
after
mr
woodhouse
s
health
cheerful
communications
about
her
mother
s
and
sweet
cake
from
the
beaufet
mrs
cole
had
just
been
there
just
called
in
for
ten
minutes
and
had
been
so
good
as
to
sit
an
hour
with
them
and
she
had
taken
a
piece
of
cake
and
been
so
kind
as
to
say
she
liked
it
very
much
and
therefore
she
hoped
miss
woodhouse
and
miss
smith
would
do
them
the
favour
to
eat
a
piece
too
the
mention
of
the
coles
was
sure
to
be
followed
by
that
of
mr
elton
there
was
intimacy
between
them
and
mr
cole
had
heard
from
mr
elton
since
his
going
away
emma
knew
what
was
coming
they
must
have
the
letter
over
again
and
settle
how
long
he
had
been
gone
and
how
much
he
was
engaged
in
company
and
what
a
favourite
he
was
wherever
he
went
and
how
full
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
ball
had
been
and
she
went
through
it
very
well
with
all
the
interest
and
all
the
commendation
that
could
be
requisite
and
always
putting
forward
to
prevent
harriet
s
being
obliged
to
say
a
word
this
she
had
been
prepared
for
when
she
entered
the
house
but
meant
having
once
talked
him
handsomely
over
to
be
no
farther
incommoded
by
any
troublesome
topic
and
to
wander
at
large
amongst
all
the
mistresses
and
misses
of
highbury
and
their
card
parties
she
had
not
been
prepared
to
have
jane
fairfax
succeed
mr
elton
but
he
was
actually
hurried
off
by
miss
bates
she
jumped
away
from
him
at
last
abruptly
to
the
coles
to
usher
in
a
letter
from
her
niece
oh
yes
mr
elton
i
understand
certainly
as
to
dancing
mrs
cole
was
telling
me
that
dancing
at
the
rooms
at
bath
was
mrs
cole
was
so
kind
as
to
sit
some
time
with
us
talking
of
jane
for
as
soon
as
she
came
in
she
began
inquiring
after
her
jane
is
so
very
great
a
favourite
there
whenever
she
is
with
us
mrs
cole
does
not
know
how
to
shew
her
kindness
enough
and
i
must
say
that
jane
deserves
it
as
much
as
any
body
can
and
so
she
began
inquiring
after
her
directly
saying
i
know
you
cannot
have
heard
from
jane
lately
because
it
is
not
her
time
for
writing
and
when
i
immediately
said
but
indeed
we
have
we
had
a
letter
this
very
morning
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
saw
any
body
more
surprized
have
you
upon
your
honour
said
she
well
that
is
quite
unexpected
do
let
me
hear
what
she
says
emma
s
politeness
was
at
hand
directly
to
say
with
smiling
interest
have
you
heard
from
miss
fairfax
so
lately
i
am
extremely
happy
i
hope
she
is
well
thank
you
you
are
so
kind
replied
the
happily
deceived
aunt
while
eagerly
hunting
for
the
letter
oh
here
it
is
i
was
sure
it
could
not
be
far
off
but
i
had
put
my
huswife
upon
it
you
see
without
being
aware
and
so
it
was
quite
hid
but
i
had
it
in
my
hand
so
very
lately
that
i
was
almost
sure
it
must
be
on
the
table
i
was
reading
it
to
mrs
cole
and
since
she
went
away
i
was
reading
it
again
to
my
mother
for
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
her
a
letter
from
jane
that
she
can
never
hear
it
often
enough
so
i
knew
it
could
not
be
far
off
and
here
it
is
only
just
under
my
huswife
and
since
you
are
so
kind
as
to
wish
to
hear
what
she
says
but
first
of
all
i
really
must
in
justice
to
jane
apologise
for
her
writing
so
short
a
letter
only
two
pages
you
see
hardly
two
and
in
general
she
fills
the
whole
paper
and
crosses
half
my
mother
often
wonders
that
i
can
make
it
out
so
well
she
often
says
when
the
letter
is
first
opened
well
hetty
now
i
think
you
will
be
put
to
it
to
make
out
all
that
checker
work
don
t
you
ma
am
and
then
i
tell
her
i
am
sure
she
would
contrive
to
make
it
out
herself
if
she
had
nobody
to
do
it
for
her
every
word
of
it
i
am
sure
she
would
pore
over
it
till
she
had
made
out
every
word
and
indeed
though
my
mother
s
eyes
are
not
so
good
as
they
were
she
can
see
amazingly
well
still
thank
god
with
the
help
of
spectacles
it
is
such
a
blessing
my
mother
s
are
really
very
good
indeed
jane
often
says
when
she
is
here
i
am
sure
grandmama
you
must
have
had
very
strong
eyes
to
see
as
you
do
and
so
much
fine
work
as
you
have
done
too
i
only
wish
my
eyes
may
last
me
as
well
all
this
spoken
extremely
fast
obliged
miss
bates
to
stop
for
breath
and
emma
said
something
very
civil
about
the
excellence
of
miss
fairfax
s
handwriting
you
are
extremely
kind
replied
miss
bates
highly
gratified
you
who
are
such
a
judge
and
write
so
beautifully
yourself
i
am
sure
there
is
nobody
s
praise
that
could
give
us
so
much
pleasure
as
miss
woodhouse
s
my
mother
does
not
hear
she
is
a
little
deaf
you
know
ma
am
addressing
her
do
you
hear
what
miss
woodhouse
is
so
obliging
to
say
about
jane
s
handwriting
and
emma
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
her
own
silly
compliment
repeated
twice
over
before
the
good
old
lady
could
comprehend
it
she
was
pondering
in
the
meanwhile
upon
the
possibility
without
seeming
very
rude
of
making
her
escape
from
jane
fairfax
s
letter
and
had
almost
resolved
on
hurrying
away
directly
under
some
slight
excuse
when
miss
bates
turned
to
her
again
and
seized
her
attention
my
mother
s
deafness
is
very
trifling
you
see
just
nothing
at
all
by
only
raising
my
voice
and
saying
any
thing
two
or
three
times
over
she
is
sure
to
hear
but
then
she
is
used
to
my
voice
but
it
is
very
remarkable
that
she
should
always
hear
jane
better
than
she
does
me
jane
speaks
so
distinct
however
she
will
not
find
her
grandmama
at
all
deafer
than
she
was
two
years
ago
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
at
my
mother
s
time
of
life
and
it
really
is
full
two
years
you
know
since
she
was
here
we
never
were
so
long
without
seeing
her
before
and
as
i
was
telling
mrs
cole
we
shall
hardly
know
how
to
make
enough
of
her
now
are
you
expecting
miss
fairfax
here
soon
oh
yes
next
week
indeed
that
must
be
a
very
great
pleasure
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
yes
next
week
every
body
is
so
surprized
and
every
body
says
the
same
obliging
things
i
am
sure
she
will
be
as
happy
to
see
her
friends
at
highbury
as
they
can
be
to
see
her
yes
friday
or
saturday
she
cannot
say
which
because
colonel
campbell
will
be
wanting
the
carriage
himself
one
of
those
days
so
very
good
of
them
to
send
her
the
whole
way
but
they
always
do
you
know
oh
yes
friday
or
saturday
next
that
is
what
she
writes
about
that
is
the
reason
of
her
writing
out
of
rule
as
we
call
it
for
in
the
common
course
we
should
not
have
heard
from
her
before
next
tuesday
or
wednesday
yes
so
i
imagined
i
was
afraid
there
could
be
little
chance
of
my
hearing
any
thing
of
miss
fairfax
to
day
so
obliging
of
you
no
we
should
not
have
heard
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
particular
circumstance
of
her
being
to
come
here
so
soon
my
mother
is
so
delighted
for
she
is
to
be
three
months
with
us
at
least
three
months
she
says
so
positively
as
i
am
going
to
have
the
pleasure
of
reading
to
you
the
case
is
you
see
that
the
campbells
are
going
to
ireland
mrs
dixon
has
persuaded
her
father
and
mother
to
come
over
and
see
her
directly
they
had
not
intended
to
go
over
till
the
summer
but
she
is
so
impatient
to
see
them
again
for
till
she
married
last
october
she
was
never
away
from
them
so
much
as
a
week
which
must
make
it
very
strange
to
be
in
different
kingdoms
i
was
going
to
say
but
however
different
countries
and
so
she
wrote
a
very
urgent
letter
to
her
mother
or
her
father
i
declare
i
do
not
know
which
it
was
but
we
shall
see
presently
in
jane
s
letter
wrote
in
mr
dixon
s
name
as
well
as
her
own
to
press
their
coming
over
directly
and
they
would
give
them
the
meeting
in
dublin
and
take
them
back
to
their
country
seat
baly
craig
a
beautiful
place
i
fancy
jane
has
heard
a
great
deal
of
its
beauty
from
mr
dixon
i
mean
i
do
not
know
that
she
ever
heard
about
it
from
any
body
else
but
it
was
very
natural
you
know
that
he
should
like
to
speak
of
his
own
place
while
he
was
paying
his
addresses
and
as
jane
used
to
be
very
often
walking
out
with
them
for
colonel
and
mrs
campbell
were
very
particular
about
their
daughter
s
not
walking
out
often
with
only
mr
dixon
for
which
i
do
not
at
all
blame
them
of
course
she
heard
every
thing
he
might
be
telling
miss
campbell
about
his
own
home
in
ireland
and
i
think
she
wrote
us
word
that
he
had
shewn
them
some
drawings
of
the
place
views
that
he
had
taken
himself
he
is
a
most
amiable
charming
young
man
i
believe
jane
was
quite
longing
to
go
to
ireland
from
his
account
of
things
at
this
moment
an
ingenious
and
animating
suspicion
entering
emma
s
brain
with
regard
to
jane
fairfax
this
charming
mr
dixon
and
the
not
going
to
ireland
she
said
with
the
insidious
design
of
farther
discovery
you
must
feel
it
very
fortunate
that
miss
fairfax
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
you
at
such
a
time
considering
the
very
particular
friendship
between
her
and
mrs
dixon
you
could
hardly
have
expected
her
to
be
excused
from
accompanying
colonel
and
mrs
campbell
very
true
very
true
indeed
the
very
thing
that
we
have
always
been
rather
afraid
of
for
we
should
not
have
liked
to
have
her
at
such
a
distance
from
us
for
months
together
not
able
to
come
if
any
thing
was
to
happen
but
you
see
every
thing
turns
out
for
the
best
they
want
her
mr
and
mrs
dixon
excessively
to
come
over
with
colonel
and
mrs
campbell
quite
depend
upon
it
nothing
can
be
more
kind
or
pressing
than
their
joint
invitation
jane
says
as
you
will
hear
presently
mr
dixon
does
not
seem
in
the
least
backward
in
any
attention
he
is
a
most
charming
young
man
ever
since
the
service
he
rendered
jane
at
weymouth
when
they
were
out
in
that
party
on
the
water
and
she
by
the
sudden
whirling
round
of
something
or
other
among
the
sails
would
have
been
dashed
into
the
sea
at
once
and
actually
was
all
but
gone
if
he
had
not
with
the
greatest
presence
of
mind
caught
hold
of
her
habit
i
can
never
think
of
it
without
trembling
but
ever
since
we
had
the
history
of
that
day
i
have
been
so
fond
of
mr
dixon
but
in
spite
of
all
her
friends
urgency
and
her
own
wish
of
seeing
ireland
miss
fairfax
prefers
devoting
the
time
to
you
and
mrs
bates
yes
entirely
her
own
doing
entirely
her
own
choice
and
colonel
and
mrs
campbell
think
she
does
quite
right
just
what
they
should
recommend
and
indeed
they
particularly
wish
her
to
try
her
native
air
as
she
has
not
been
quite
so
well
as
usual
lately
i
am
concerned
to
hear
of
it
i
think
they
judge
wisely
but
mrs
dixon
must
be
very
much
disappointed
mrs
dixon
i
understand
has
no
remarkable
degree
of
personal
beauty
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
compared
with
miss
fairfax
oh
no
you
are
very
obliging
to
say
such
things
but
certainly
not
there
is
no
comparison
between
them
miss
campbell
always
was
absolutely
plain
but
extremely
elegant
and
amiable
yes
that
of
course
jane
caught
a
bad
cold
poor
thing
so
long
ago
as
the
7th
of
november
as
i
am
going
to
read
to
you
and
has
never
been
well
since
a
long
time
is
not
it
for
a
cold
to
hang
upon
her
she
never
mentioned
it
before
because
she
would
not
alarm
us
just
like
her
so
considerate
but
however
she
is
so
far
from
well
that
her
kind
friends
the
campbells
think
she
had
better
come
home
and
try
an
air
that
always
agrees
with
her
and
they
have
no
doubt
that
three
or
four
months
at
highbury
will
entirely
cure
her
and
it
is
certainly
a
great
deal
better
that
she
should
come
here
than
go
to
ireland
if
she
is
unwell
nobody
could
nurse
her
as
we
should
do
it
appears
to
me
the
most
desirable
arrangement
in
the
world
and
so
she
is
to
come
to
us
next
friday
or
saturday
and
the
campbells
leave
town
in
their
way
to
holyhead
the
monday
following
as
you
will
find
from
jane
s
letter
so
sudden
you
may
guess
dear
miss
woodhouse
what
a
flurry
it
has
thrown
me
in
if
it
was
not
for
the
drawback
of
her
illness
but
i
am
afraid
we
must
expect
to
see
her
grown
thin
and
looking
very
poorly
i
must
tell
you
what
an
unlucky
thing
happened
to
me
as
to
that
i
always
make
a
point
of
reading
jane
s
letters
through
to
myself
first
before
i
read
them
aloud
to
my
mother
you
know
for
fear
of
there
being
any
thing
in
them
to
distress
her
jane
desired
me
to
do
it
so
i
always
do
and
so
i
began
to
day
with
my
usual
caution
but
no
sooner
did
i
come
to
the
mention
of
her
being
unwell
than
i
burst
out
quite
frightened
with
bless
me
poor
jane
is
ill
which
my
mother
being
on
the
watch
heard
distinctly
and
was
sadly
alarmed
at
however
when
i
read
on
i
found
it
was
not
near
so
bad
as
i
had
fancied
at
first
and
i
make
so
light
of
it
now
to
her
that
she
does
not
think
much
about
it
but
i
cannot
imagine
how
i
could
be
so
off
my
guard
if
jane
does
not
get
well
soon
we
will
call
in
mr
perry
the
expense
shall
not
be
thought
of
and
though
he
is
so
liberal
and
so
fond
of
jane
that
i
dare
say
he
would
not
mean
to
charge
any
thing
for
attendance
we
could
not
suffer
it
to
be
so
you
know
he
has
a
wife
and
family
to
maintain
and
is
not
to
be
giving
away
his
time
well
now
i
have
just
given
you
a
hint
of
what
jane
writes
about
we
will
turn
to
her
letter
and
i
am
sure
she
tells
her
own
story
a
great
deal
better
than
i
can
tell
it
for
her
i
am
afraid
we
must
be
running
away
said
emma
glancing
at
harriet
and
beginning
to
rise
my
father
will
be
expecting
us
i
had
no
intention
i
thought
i
had
no
power
of
staying
more
than
five
minutes
when
i
first
entered
the
house
i
merely
called
because
i
would
not
pass
the
door
without
inquiring
after
mrs
bates
but
i
have
been
so
pleasantly
detained
now
however
we
must
wish
you
and
mrs
bates
good
morning
and
not
all
that
could
be
urged
to
detain
her
succeeded
she
regained
the
street
happy
in
this
that
though
much
had
been
forced
on
her
against
her
will
though
she
had
in
fact
heard
the
whole
substance
of
jane
fairfax
s
letter
she
had
been
able
to
escape
the
letter
itself
chapter
ii
jane
fairfax
was
an
orphan
the
only
child
of
mrs
bates
s
youngest
daughter
the
marriage
of
lieut
fairfax
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
and
miss
jane
bates
had
had
its
day
of
fame
and
pleasure
hope
and
interest
but
nothing
now
remained
of
it
save
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
him
dying
in
action
abroad
of
his
widow
sinking
under
consumption
and
grief
soon
afterwards
and
this
girl
by
birth
she
belonged
to
highbury
and
when
at
three
years
old
on
losing
her
mother
she
became
the
property
the
charge
the
consolation
the
fondling
of
her
grandmother
and
aunt
there
had
seemed
every
probability
of
her
being
permanently
fixed
there
of
her
being
taught
only
what
very
limited
means
could
command
and
growing
up
with
no
advantages
of
connexion
or
improvement
to
be
engrafted
on
what
nature
had
given
her
in
a
pleasing
person
good
understanding
and
warm
hearted
well
meaning
relations
but
the
compassionate
feelings
of
a
friend
of
her
father
gave
a
change
to
her
destiny
this
was
colonel
campbell
who
had
very
highly
regarded
fairfax
as
an
excellent
officer
and
most
deserving
young
man
and
farther
had
been
indebted
to
him
for
such
attentions
during
a
severe
camp
fever
as
he
believed
had
saved
his
life
these
were
claims
which
he
did
not
learn
to
overlook
though
some
years
passed
away
from
the
death
of
poor
fairfax
before
his
own
return
to
england
put
any
thing
in
his
power
when
he
did
return
he
sought
out
the
child
and
took
notice
of
her
he
was
a
married
man
with
only
one
living
child
a
girl
about
jane
s
age
and
jane
became
their
guest
paying
them
long
visits
and
growing
a
favourite
with
all
and
before
she
was
nine
years
old
his
daughter
s
great
fondness
for
her
and
his
own
wish
of
being
a
real
friend
united
to
produce
an
offer
from
colonel
campbell
of
undertaking
the
whole
charge
of
her
education
it
was
accepted
and
from
that
period
jane
had
belonged
to
colonel
campbell
s
family
and
had
lived
with
them
entirely
only
visiting
her
grandmother
from
time
to
time
the
plan
was
that
she
should
be
brought
up
for
educating
others
the
very
few
hundred
pounds
which
she
inherited
from
her
father
making
independence
impossible
to
provide
for
her
otherwise
was
out
of
colonel
campbell
s
power
for
though
his
income
by
pay
and
appointments
was
handsome
his
fortune
was
moderate
and
must
be
all
his
daughter
s
but
by
giving
her
an
education
he
hoped
to
be
supplying
the
means
of
respectable
subsistence
hereafter
such
was
jane
fairfax
s
history
she
had
fallen
into
good
hands
known
nothing
but
kindness
from
the
campbells
and
been
given
an
excellent
education
living
constantly
with
right
minded
and
well
informed
people
her
heart
and
understanding
had
received
every
advantage
of
discipline
and
culture
and
colonel
campbell
s
residence
being
in
london
every
lighter
talent
had
been
done
full
justice
to
by
the
attendance
of
first
rate
masters
her
disposition
and
abilities
were
equally
worthy
of
all
that
friendship
could
do
and
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
she
was
as
far
as
such
an
early
age
can
be
qualified
for
the
care
of
children
fully
competent
to
the
office
of
instruction
herself
but
she
was
too
much
beloved
to
be
parted
with
neither
father
nor
mother
could
promote
and
the
daughter
could
not
endure
it
the
evil
day
was
put
off
it
was
easy
to
decide
that
she
was
still
too
young
and
jane
remained
with
them
sharing
as
another
daughter
in
all
the
rational
pleasures
of
an
elegant
society
and
a
judicious
mixture
of
home
and
amusement
with
only
the
drawback
of
the
future
the
sobering
suggestions
of
her
own
good
understanding
to
remind
her
that
all
this
might
soon
be
over
the
affection
of
the
whole
family
the
warm
attachment
of
miss
campbell
in
particular
was
the
more
honourable
to
each
party
from
the
circumstance
of
jane
s
decided
superiority
both
in
beauty
and
acquirements
that
nature
had
given
it
in
feature
could
not
be
unseen
by
the
young
woman
nor
could
her
higher
powers
of
mind
be
unfelt
by
the
parents
they
continued
together
with
unabated
regard
however
till
the
marriage
of
miss
campbell
who
by
that
chance
that
luck
which
so
often
defies
anticipation
in
matrimonial
affairs
giving
attraction
to
what
is
moderate
rather
than
to
what
is
superior
engaged
the
affections
of
mr
dixon
a
young
man
rich
and
agreeable
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
acquainted
and
was
eligibly
and
happily
settled
while
jane
fairfax
had
yet
her
bread
to
earn
this
event
had
very
lately
taken
place
too
lately
for
any
thing
to
be
yet
attempted
by
her
less
fortunate
friend
towards
entering
on
her
path
of
duty
though
she
had
now
reached
the
age
which
her
own
judgment
had
fixed
on
for
beginning
she
had
long
resolved
that
one
and
twenty
should
be
the
period
with
the
fortitude
of
a
devoted
novitiate
she
had
resolved
at
one
and
twenty
to
complete
the
sacrifice
and
retire
from
all
the
pleasures
of
life
of
rational
intercourse
equal
society
peace
and
hope
to
penance
and
mortification
for
ever
the
good
sense
of
colonel
and
mrs
campbell
could
not
oppose
such
a
resolution
though
their
feelings
did
as
long
as
they
lived
no
exertions
would
be
necessary
their
home
might
be
hers
for
ever
and
for
their
own
comfort
they
would
have
retained
her
wholly
but
this
would
be
selfishness
what
must
be
at
last
had
better
be
soon
perhaps
they
began
to
feel
it
might
have
been
kinder
and
wiser
to
have
resisted
the
temptation
of
any
delay
and
spared
her
from
a
taste
of
such
enjoyments
of
ease
and
leisure
as
must
now
be
relinquished
still
however
affection
was
glad
to
catch
at
any
reasonable
excuse
for
not
hurrying
on
the
wretched
moment
she
had
never
been
quite
well
since
the
time
of
their
daughter
s
marriage
and
till
she
should
have
completely
recovered
her
usual
strength
they
must
forbid
her
engaging
in
duties
which
so
far
from
being
compatible
with
a
weakened
frame
and
varying
spirits
seemed
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
to
require
something
more
than
human
perfection
of
body
and
mind
to
be
discharged
with
tolerable
comfort
with
regard
to
her
not
accompanying
them
to
ireland
her
account
to
her
aunt
contained
nothing
but
truth
though
there
might
be
some
truths
not
told
it
was
her
own
choice
to
give
the
time
of
their
absence
to
highbury
to
spend
perhaps
her
last
months
of
perfect
liberty
with
those
kind
relations
to
whom
she
was
so
very
dear
and
the
campbells
whatever
might
be
their
motive
or
motives
whether
single
or
double
or
treble
gave
the
arrangement
their
ready
sanction
and
said
that
they
depended
more
on
a
few
months
spent
in
her
native
air
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
than
on
any
thing
else
certain
it
was
that
she
was
to
come
and
that
highbury
instead
of
welcoming
that
perfect
novelty
which
had
been
so
long
promised
it
mr
frank
churchill
must
put
up
for
the
present
with
jane
fairfax
who
could
bring
only
the
freshness
of
a
two
years
absence
emma
was
sorry
to
have
to
pay
civilities
to
a
person
she
did
not
like
through
three
long
months
to
be
always
doing
more
than
she
wished
and
less
than
she
ought
why
she
did
not
like
jane
fairfax
might
be
a
difficult
question
to
answer
mr
knightley
had
once
told
her
it
was
because
she
saw
in
her
the
really
accomplished
young
woman
which
she
wanted
to
be
thought
herself
and
though
the
accusation
had
been
eagerly
refuted
at
the
time
there
were
moments
of
self
examination
in
which
her
conscience
could
not
quite
acquit
her
but
she
could
never
get
acquainted
with
her
she
did
not
know
how
it
was
but
there
was
such
coldness
and
reserve
such
apparent
indifference
whether
she
pleased
or
not
and
then
her
aunt
was
such
an
eternal
talker
and
she
was
made
such
a
fuss
with
by
every
body
and
it
had
been
always
imagined
that
they
were
to
be
so
intimate
because
their
ages
were
the
same
every
body
had
supposed
they
must
be
so
fond
of
each
other
these
were
her
reasons
she
had
no
better
it
was
a
dislike
so
little
just
every
imputed
fault
was
so
magnified
by
fancy
that
she
never
saw
jane
fairfax
the
first
time
after
any
considerable
absence
without
feeling
that
she
had
injured
her
and
now
when
the
due
visit
was
paid
on
her
arrival
after
a
two
years
interval
she
was
particularly
struck
with
the
very
appearance
and
manners
which
for
those
two
whole
years
she
had
been
depreciating
jane
fairfax
was
very
elegant
remarkably
elegant
and
she
had
herself
the
highest
value
for
elegance
her
height
was
pretty
just
such
as
almost
every
body
would
think
tall
and
nobody
could
think
very
tall
her
figure
particularly
graceful
her
size
a
most
becoming
medium
between
fat
and
thin
though
a
slight
appearance
of
ill
health
seemed
to
point
out
the
likeliest
evil
of
the
two
emma
could
not
but
feel
all
this
and
then
her
face
her
features
there
was
more
beauty
in
them
altogether
than
she
had
remembered
it
was
not
regular
but
it
was
very
pleasing
beauty
her
eyes
a
deep
grey
with
dark
eye
lashes
and
eyebrows
had
never
been
denied
their
praise
but
the
skin
which
she
had
been
used
to
cavil
at
as
wanting
colour
had
a
clearness
and
delicacy
which
really
needed
no
fuller
bloom
it
was
a
style
of
beauty
of
which
elegance
was
the
reigning
character
and
as
such
she
must
in
honour
by
all
her
principles
admire
it
elegance
which
whether
of
person
or
of
mind
she
saw
so
little
in
highbury
there
not
to
be
vulgar
was
distinction
and
merit
in
short
she
sat
during
the
first
visit
looking
at
jane
fairfax
with
twofold
complacency
the
sense
of
pleasure
and
the
sense
of
rendering
justice
and
was
determining
that
she
would
dislike
her
no
longer
when
she
took
in
her
history
indeed
her
situation
as
well
as
her
beauty
when
she
considered
what
all
this
elegance
was
destined
to
what
she
was
going
to
sink
from
how
she
was
going
to
live
it
seemed
impossible
to
feel
any
thing
but
compassion
and
respect
especially
if
to
every
well
known
particular
entitling
her
to
interest
were
added
the
highly
probable
circumstance
of
an
attachment
to
mr
dixon
which
she
had
so
naturally
started
to
herself
in
that
case
nothing
could
be
more
pitiable
or
more
honourable
than
the
sacrifices
she
had
resolved
on
emma
was
very
willing
now
to
acquit
her
of
having
seduced
mr
dixon
s
actions
from
his
wife
or
of
any
thing
mischievous
which
her
imagination
had
suggested
at
first
if
it
were
love
it
might
be
simple
single
successless
love
on
her
side
alone
she
might
have
been
unconsciously
sucking
in
the
sad
poison
while
a
sharer
of
his
conversation
with
her
friend
and
from
the
best
the
purest
of
motives
might
now
be
denying
herself
this
visit
to
ireland
and
resolving
to
divide
herself
effectually
from
him
and
his
connexions
by
soon
beginning
her
career
of
laborious
duty
upon
the
whole
emma
left
her
with
such
softened
charitable
feelings
as
made
her
look
around
in
walking
home
and
lament
that
highbury
afforded
no
young
man
worthy
of
giving
her
independence
nobody
that
she
could
wish
to
scheme
about
for
her
these
were
charming
feelings
but
not
lasting
before
she
had
committed
herself
by
any
public
profession
of
eternal
friendship
for
jane
fairfax
or
done
more
towards
a
recantation
of
past
prejudices
and
errors
than
saying
to
mr
knightley
she
certainly
is
handsome
she
is
better
than
handsome
jane
had
spent
an
evening
at
hartfield
with
her
grandmother
and
aunt
and
every
thing
was
relapsing
much
into
its
usual
state
former
provocations
reappeared
the
aunt
was
as
tiresome
as
ever
more
tiresome
because
anxiety
for
her
health
was
now
added
to
admiration
of
her
powers
and
they
had
to
listen
to
the
description
of
exactly
how
little
bread
and
butter
she
ate
for
breakfast
and
how
small
a
slice
of
mutton
for
dinner
as
well
as
to
see
exhibitions
of
new
caps
and
new
workbags
for
her
mother
and
herself
and
jane
s
offences
rose
again
they
had
music
emma
was
obliged
to
play
and
the
thanks
and
praise
which
necessarily
followed
appeared
to
her
an
affectation
of
candour
an
air
of
greatness
meaning
only
to
shew
off
in
higher
style
her
own
very
superior
performance
she
was
besides
which
was
the
worst
of
all
so
cold
so
cautious
there
was
no
getting
at
her
real
opinion
wrapt
up
in
a
cloak
of
politeness
she
seemed
determined
to
hazard
nothing
she
was
disgustingly
was
suspiciously
reserved
if
any
thing
could
be
more
where
all
was
most
she
was
more
reserved
on
the
subject
of
weymouth
and
the
dixons
than
any
thing
she
seemed
bent
on
giving
no
real
insight
into
mr
dixon
s
character
or
her
own
value
for
his
company
or
opinion
of
the
suitableness
of
the
match
it
was
all
general
approbation
and
smoothness
nothing
delineated
or
distinguished
it
did
her
no
service
however
her
caution
was
thrown
away
emma
saw
its
artifice
and
returned
to
her
first
surmises
there
probably
was
something
more
to
conceal
than
her
own
preference
mr
dixon
perhaps
had
been
very
near
changing
one
friend
for
the
other
or
been
fixed
only
to
miss
campbell
for
the
sake
of
the
future
twelve
thousand
pounds
the
like
reserve
prevailed
on
other
topics
she
and
mr
frank
churchill
had
been
at
weymouth
at
the
same
time
it
was
known
that
they
were
a
little
acquainted
but
not
a
syllable
of
real
information
could
emma
procure
as
to
what
he
truly
was
was
he
handsome
she
believed
he
was
reckoned
a
very
fine
young
man
was
he
agreeable
he
was
generally
thought
so
did
he
appear
a
sensible
young
man
a
young
man
of
information
at
a
watering
place
or
in
a
common
london
acquaintance
it
was
difficult
to
decide
on
such
points
manners
were
all
that
could
be
safely
judged
of
under
a
much
longer
knowledge
than
they
had
yet
had
of
mr
churchill
she
believed
every
body
found
his
manners
pleasing
emma
could
not
forgive
her
