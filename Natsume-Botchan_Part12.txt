a
note
by
the
translator
no
translation
can
expect
to
equal
much
less
to
excel
the
original
the
excellence
of
a
translation
can
only
be
judged
by
noting
how
far
it
has
succeeded
in
reproducing
the
original
tone
colors
style
the
delicacy
of
sentiment
the
force
of
inert
strength
the
peculiar
expressions
native
to
the
language
with
which
the
original
is
written
or
whatever
is
its
marked
characteristic
the
ablest
can
do
no
more
and
to
want
more
than
this
will
be
demanding
something
impossible
strictly
speaking
the
only
way
one
can
derive
full
benefit
or
enjoyment
from
a
foreign
work
is
to
read
the
original
for
any
intelligence
at
second
hand
never
gives
the
kind
of
satisfaction
which
is
possible
only
through
the
direct
touch
with
the
original
even
in
the
best
translated
work
is
probably
wanted
the
subtle
vitality
natural
to
the
original
language
for
it
defies
an
attempt
however
elaborate
to
transmit
all
there
is
in
the
original
correctness
of
diction
may
be
there
but
spontaneity
is
gone
it
cannot
be
helped
the
task
of
the
translator
becomes
doubly
hazardous
in
case
of
translating
a
european
language
into
japanese
or
vice
versa
between
any
of
the
european
languages
and
japanese
there
is
no
visible
kinship
in
word
form
significance
grammatical
system
rhetorical
arrangements
it
may
be
said
that
the
inspiration
of
the
two
languages
is
totally
different
a
want
of
similarity
of
customs
habits
traditions
national
sentiments
and
traits
makes
the
work
of
translation
all
the
more
difficult
a
novel
written
in
japanese
which
had
attained
national
popularity
might
when
rendered
into
english
lose
its
captivating
vividness
alluring
interest
and
lasting
appeal
to
the
reader
these
remarks
are
made
not
in
way
of
excuse
for
any
faulty
dictions
that
may
be
found
in
the
following
pages
neither
are
they
made
out
of
personal
modesty
nor
of
a
desire
to
add
undue
weight
to
the
present
work
they
are
made
in
the
hope
that
whoever
is
good
enough
to
go
through
the
present
translation
will
remember
before
he
may
venture
to
make
criticisms
the
kind
and
extent
of
difficulties
besetting
him
in
his
attempts
so
as
not
to
judge
the
merit
of
the
original
by
this
translation
nothing
would
afford
the
translator
a
greater
pain
than
any
unfavorable
comment
on
the
original
based
upon
this
translation
if
there
be
any
deserving
merits
in
the
following
pages
the
credit
is
due
to
the
original
any
fault
found
in
its
interpretation
or
in
the
english
version
the
whole
responsibility
is
on
the
translator
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
may
not
know
the
original
it
must
be
stated
that
botchan
by
the
late
mr
k
natsume
was
an
epoch
making
piece
of
work
on
its
first
appearance
mr
natsume
s
place
and
name
as
the
foremost
in
the
new
literary
school
were
firmly
established
he
had
written
many
other
novels
of
more
serious
intent
of
heavier
thoughts
and
of
more
enduring
merits
but
it
was
this
botchan
that
secured
him
the
lasting
fame
its
quaint
style
dash
and
vigor
in
its
narration
appealed
to
the
public
who
had
become
somewhat
tired
of
the
stereotyped
sort
of
manner
with
which
all
stories
had
come
to
be
handled
in
its
simplest
understanding
botchan
may
be
taken
as
an
episode
in
the
life
of
a
son
born
in
tokyo
hot
blooded
simple
hearted
pure
as
crystal
and
sturdy
as
a
towering
rock
honest
and
straight
to
a
fault
intolerant
of
the
least
injustice
and
a
volunteer
ever
ready
to
champion
what
he
considers
right
and
good
children
may
read
it
as
a
story
of
man
who
tried
to
be
honest
it
is
a
light
amusing
and
at
the
name
time
instructive
story
with
no
tangle
of
love
affairs
no
scheme
of
blood
curdling
scenes
or
nothing
startling
or
sensational
in
the
plot
or
characters
the
story
however
may
be
regarded
as
a
biting
sarcasm
on
a
hypocritical
society
in
which
a
gang
of
instructors
of
dark
character
at
a
middle
school
in
a
backwoods
town
plays
a
prominent
part
the
hero
of
the
story
is
made
a
victim
of
their
annoying
intrigues
but
finally
comes
out
triumphant
by
smashing
the
petty
red
tapism
knocking
down
the
sham
pretentions
and
by
actual
use
of
the
fist
on
the
head
instructor
and
his
henchman
the
story
will
be
found
equally
entertaining
as
a
means
of
studying
the
peculiar
traits
of
the
native
of
tokyo
which
are
characterised
by
their
quick
temper
dashing
spirit
generosity
and
by
their
readiness
to
resist
even
the
lordly
personage
if
convinced
of
their
own
justness
or
to
kneel
down
even
to
a
child
if
they
acknowledge
their
own
wrong
incidently
the
touching
devotion
of
the
old
maid
servant
kiyo
to
the
hero
will
prove
a
standing
reproach
to
the
inconstant
unfaithful
servants
of
which
the
number
is
ever
increasing
these
days
in
tokyo
the
story
becomes
doubly
interesting
by
the
fact
that
mr
k
natsume
when
quite
young
held
a
position
of
teacher
of
english
at
a
middle
school
somewhere
about
the
same
part
of
the
country
described
in
the
story
while
he
himself
was
born
and
brought
up
in
tokyo
it
may
be
added
that
the
original
is
written
in
an
autobiographical
style
it
is
profusely
interladed
with
spicy
catchy
colloquials
patent
to
the
people
of
tokyo
for
the
equals
of
which
we
may
look
to
the
rattling
speeches
of
notorious
chuck
conners
of
the
bowery
of
new
york
it
should
be
frankly
stated
that
much
difficulty
was
experienced
in
getting
the
corresponding
terms
in
english
for
those
catchy
expressions
strictly
speaking
some
of
them
have
no
english
equivalents
care
has
been
exercised
to
select
what
has
been
thought
most
appropriate
in
the
judgment
or
the
translator
in
converting
those
expressions
into
english
but
some
of
them
might
provoke
disapproval
from
those
of
the
cultured
class
with
refined
ears
the
slangs
in
english
in
this
translation
were
taken
from
an
american
magazine
of
world
wide
reputation
editor
of
which
was
not
afraid
to
print
of
damn
when
necessary
by
scorning
the
timid
conventional
way
of
putting
it
as
d
n
if
the
propriety
of
printing
such
short
ugly
words
be
questioned
the
translator
is
sorry
to
say
that
no
means
now
exists
of
directly
bringing
him
to
account
for
he
met
untimely
death
on
board
the
lusitania
when
it
was
sunk
by
the
german
submarine
thanks
are
due
to
mr
j
r
kennedy
general
manager
and
mr
henry
satoh
editor
in
chief
both
of
the
kokusai
tsushin
sha
the
international
news
agency
of
tokyo
and
a
host
of
personal
friends
of
the
translator
whose
untiring
assistance
and
kind
suggestions
have
made
the
present
translation
possible
without
their
sympathetic
interests

botchan
master
darling
chapter
i
because
of
an
hereditary
recklessness
i
have
been
playing
always
a
losing
game
since
my
childhood
during
my
grammar
school
days
i
was
once
laid
up
for
about
a
week
by
jumping
from
the
second
story
of
the
school
building
some
may
ask
why
i
committed
such
a
rash
act
there
was
no
particular
reason
for
doing
such
a
thing
except
i
happened
to
be
looking
out
into
the
yard
from
the
second
floor
of
the
newly
built
school
house
when
one
of
my
classmates
joking
shouted
at
me
say
you
big
bluff
i
ll
bet
you
can
t
jump
down
from
there
o
you
chicken
heart
ha
ha
so
i
jumped
down
the
janitor
of
the
school
had
to
carry
me
home
on
his
back
and
when
my
father
saw
me
he
yelled
derisively
what
a
fellow
you
are
to
go
and
get
your
bones
dislocated
by
jumping
only
from
a
second
story
i
ll
see
i
don
t
get
dislocated
next
time
i
answered
one
of
my
relatives
once
presented
me
with
a
pen
knife
i
was
showing
it
to
my
friends
reflecting
its
pretty
blades
against
the
rays
of
the
sun
when
one
of
them
chimed
in
that
the
blades
gleamed
all
right
but
seemed
rather
dull
for
cutting
with
rather
dull
see
if
they
don
t
cut
i
retorted
cut
your
finger
then
he
challenged
and
with
finger
nothing
here
goes
i
cut
my
thumb
slant
wise
fortunately
the
knife
was
small
and
the
bone
of
the
thumb
hard
enough
so
the
thumb
is
still
there
but
the
scar
will
be
there
until
my
death
about
twenty
steps
to
the
east
edge
of
our
garden
there
was
a
moderate
sized
vegetable
yard
rising
toward
the
south
and
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
chestnut
tree
which
was
dearer
to
me
than
life
in
the
season
when
the
chestnuts
were
ripe
i
used
to
slip
out
of
the
house
from
the
back
door
early
in
the
morning
to
pick
up
the
chestnuts
which
had
fallen
during
the
night
and
eat
them
at
the
school
on
the
west
side
of
the
vegetable
yard
was
the
adjoining
garden
of
a
pawn
shop
called
yamashiro
ya
this
shopkeeper
s
son
was
a
boy
about
13
or
14
years
old
named
kantaro
kantaro
was
it
happens
a
mollycoddle
nevertheless
he
had
the
temerity
to
come
over
the
fence
to
our
yard
and
steal
my
chestnuts
one
certain
evening
i
hid
myself
behind
a
folding
gate
of
the
fence
and
caught
him
in
the
act
having
his
retreat
cut
off
he
grappled
with
me
in
desperation
he
was
about
two
years
older
than
i
and
though
weak
kneed
was
physically
the
stronger
while
i
wallopped
him
he
pushed
his
head
against
my
breast
and
by
chance
it
slipped
inside
my
sleeve
as
this
hindered
the
free
action
of
my
arm
i
tried
to
shake
him
loose
though
his
head
dangled
the
further
inside
and
being
no
longer
able
to
stand
the
stifling
combat
he
bit
my
bare
arm
it
was
painful
i
held
him
fast
against
the
fence
and
by
a
dexterous
foot
twist
sent
him
down
flat
on
his
back
kantaro
broke
the
fence
and
as
the
ground
belonging
to
yamashiro
ya
was
about
six
feet
lower
than
the
vegetable
yard
he
fell
headlong
to
his
own
territory
with
a
thud
as
he
rolled
off
he
tore
away
the
sleeve
in
which
his
head
had
been
enwrapped
and
my
arm
recovered
a
sudden
freedom
of
movement
that
night
when
my
mother
went
to
yamashiro
ya
to
apologize
she
brought
back
that
sleeve
besides
the
above
i
did
many
other
mischiefs
with
kaneko
of
a
carpenter
shop
and
kaku
of
a
fishmarket
i
once
ruined
a
carrot
patch
of
one
mosaku
the
sprouts
were
just
shooting
out
and
the
patch
was
covered
with
straws
to
ensure
their
even
healthy
growth
upon
this
straw
covered
patch
we
three
wrestled
for
fully
half
a
day
and
consequently
thoroughly
smashed
all
the
sprouts
also
i
once
filled
up
a
well
which
watered
some
rice
fields
owned
by
one
furukawa
and
he
followed
me
with
kicks
the
well
was
so
devised
that
from
a
large
bamboo
pole
sunk
deep
into
the
ground
the
water
issued
and
irrigated
the
rice
fields
ignorant
of
the
mechanical
side
of
this
irrigating
method
at
that
time
i
stuffed
the
bamboo
pole
with
stones
and
sticks
and
satisfied
that
no
more
water
came
up
i
returned
home
and
was
eating
supper
when
furukawa
fiery
red
with
anger
burst
into
our
house
with
howling
protests
i
believe
the
affair
was
settled
on
our
paying
for
the
damage
father
did
not
like
me
in
the
least
and
mother
always
sided
with
my
big
brother
this
brother
s
face
was
palish
white
and
he
had
a
fondness
for
taking
the
part
of
an
actress
at
the
theatre
this
fellow
will
never
amount
to
much
father
used
to
remark
when
he
saw
me
he
s
so
reckless
that
i
worry
about
his
future
i
often
heard
mother
say
of
me
exactly
i
have
never
amounted
to
much
i
am
just
as
you
see
me
no
wonder
my
future
used
to
cause
anxiety
to
my
mother
i
am
living
without
becoming
but
a
jailbird
two
or
three
days
previous
to
my
mother
s
death
i
took
it
into
my
head
to
turn
a
somersault
in
the
kitchen
and
painfully
hit
my
ribs
against
the
corner
of
the
stove
mother
was
very
angry
at
this
and
told
me
not
to
show
my
face
again
so
i
went
to
a
relative
to
stay
with
while
there
i
received
the
news
that
my
mother
s
illness
had
become
very
serious
and
that
after
all
efforts
for
her
recovery
she
was
dead
i
came
home
thinking
that
i
should
have
behaved
better
if
i
had
known
the
conditions
were
so
serious
as
that
then
that
big
brother
of
mine
denounced
me
as
wanting
in
filial
piety
and
that
i
had
caused
her
untimely
death
mortified
at
this
i
slapped
his
face
and
thereupon
received
a
sound
scolding
from
father
after
the
death
of
mother
i
lived
with
father
and
brother
father
did
nothing
and
always
said
you
re
no
good
to
my
face
what
he
meant
by
no
good
i
am
yet
to
understand
a
funny
dad
he
was
my
brother
was
to
be
seen
studying
english
hard
saying
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
businessman
he
was
like
a
girl
by
nature
and
so
sassy
that
we
two
were
never
on
good
terms
and
had
to
fight
it
out
about
once
every
ten
days
when
we
played
a
chess
game
one
day
he
placed
a
chessman
as
a
waiter
a
cowardly
tactic
this
and
had
hearty
laugh
on
me
by
seeing
me
in
a
fix
his
manner
was
so
trying
that
time
that
i
banged
a
chessman
on
his
forehead
which
was
injured
a
little
bit
and
bled
he
told
all
about
this
to
father
who
said
he
would
disinherit
me
then
i
gave
up
myself
for
lost
and
expected
to
be
really
disinherited
but
our
maid
kiyo
who
had
been
with
us
for
ten
years
or
so
interceded
on
my
behalf
and
tearfully
apologized
for
me
and
by
her
appeal
my
father
s
wrath
was
softened
i
did
not
regard
him
however
as
one
to
be
afraid
of
in
any
way
but
rather
felt
sorry
for
our
kiyo
i
had
heard
that
kiyo
was
of
a
decent
well
to
do
family
but
being
driven
to
poverty
at
the
time
of
the
restoration
had
to
work
as
a
servant
so
she
was
an
old
woman
by
this
time
this
old
woman
by
what
affinity
as
the
buddhists
say
i
don
t
know
loved
me
a
great
deal
strange
indeed
she
was
almost
blindly
fond
of
me
me
whom
mother
became
thoroughly
disgusted
with
three
days
before
her
death
whom
father
considered
a
most
aggravating
proposition
all
the
year
round
and
whom
the
neighbors
cordially
hated
as
the
local
bully
among
the
youngsters
i
had
long
reconciled
myself
to
the
fact
that
my
nature
was
far
from
being
attractive
to
others
and
so
didn
t
mind
if
i
were
treated
as
a
piece
of
wood
so
i
thought
it
uncommon
that
kiyo
should
pet
me
like
that
sometimes
in
the
kitchen
when
there
was
nobody
around
she
would
praise
me
saying
that
i
was
straightforward
and
of
a
good
disposition
what
she
meant
by
that
exactly
was
not
clear
to
me
however
if
i
were
of
so
good
a
nature
as
she
said
i
imagined
those
other
than
kiyo
should
accord
me
a
better
treatment
so
whenever
kiyo
said
to
me
anything
of
the
kind
i
used
to
answer
that
i
did
not
like
passing
compliments
then
she
would
remark
that
s
the
very
reason
i
say
you
are
of
a
good
disposition
and
would
gaze
at
me
with
absorbing
tenderness
she
seemed
to
recreate
me
by
her
own
imagination
and
was
proud
of
the
fact
i
felt
even
chilled
through
my
marrow
at
her
constant
attention
to
me
after
my
mother
was
dead
kiyo
loved
me
still
more
in
my
simple
reasoning
i
wondered
why
she
had
taken
such
a
fancy
to
me
sometimes
i
thought
it
quite
futile
on
her
part
that
she
had
better
quit
that
sort
of
thing
which
was
bad
for
her
but
she
loved
me
just
the
same
once
in
a
while
she
would
buy
out
of
her
own
pocket
some
cakes
or
sweetmeats
for
me
when
the
night
was
cold
she
would
secretly
buy
some
noodle
powder
and
bring
all
unawares
hot
noodle
gruel
to
my
bed
or
sometimes
she
would
even
buy
a
bowl
of
steaming
noodles
from
the
peddler
not
only
with
edibles
but
she
was
generous
alike
with
socks
pencils
note
books
etc
and
she
even
furnished
me
this
happened
some
time
later
with
about
three
yen
i
did
not
ask
her
for
the
money
she
offered
it
from
her
own
good
will
by
bringing
it
to
my
room
saying
that
i
might
be
in
need
of
some
cash
this
of
course
embarrassed
me
but
as
she
was
so
insistent
i
consented
to
borrow
it
i
confess
i
was
really
glad
of
the
money
i
put
it
in
a
bag
and
carried
it
in
my
pocket
while
about
the
house
i
happened
to
drop
the
bag
into
a
cesspool
helpless
i
told
kiyo
how
i
had
lost
the
money
and
at
once
she
fetched
a
bamboo
stick
and
said
she
will
get
it
for
me
after
a
while
i
heard
a
splashing
sound
of
water
about
our
family
well
and
going
there
saw
kiyo
washing
the
bag
strung
on
the
end
of
the
stick
i
opened
the
bag
and
found
the
edict
of
the
three
one
yen
bills
turned
to
faint
yellow
and
designs
fading
kiyo
dried
them
at
an
open
fire
and
handed
them
over
to
me
asking
if
they
were
all
right
i
smelled
them
and
said
they
stink
yet
give
them
to
me
i
ll
get
them
changed
she
took
those
three
bills
and
i
do
not
know
how
she
went
about
it
brought
three
yen
in
silver
i
forget
now
upon
what
i
spent
the
three
yen
i
ll
pay
you
back
soon
i
said
at
the
time
but
didn
t
i
could
not
now
pay
it
back
even
if
i
wished
to
do
so
with
ten
times
the
amount
when
kiyo
gave
me
anything
she
did
so
always
when
both
father
and
brother
were
out
many
things
i
do
not
like
but
what
i
most
detest
is
the
monopolizing
of
favors
behind
some
one
else
s
back
bad
as
my
relations
were
with
my
brother
still
i
did
not
feel
justified
in
accepting
candies
or
color
pencils
from
kiyo
without
my
brother
s
knowledge
why
do
you
give
those
things
only
to
me
and
not
to
my
brother
also
i
asked
her
once
and
she
answered
quite
unconcernedly
that
my
brother
may
be
left
to
himself
as
his
father
bought
him
everything
that
was
partiality
father
was
obstinate
but
i
am
sure
he
was
not
a
man
who
would
indulge
in
favoritism
to
kiyo
however
he
might
have
looked
that
way
there
is
no
doubt
that
kiyo
was
blind
to
the
extent
of
her
undue
indulgence
with
me
she
was
said
to
have
come
from
a
well
to
do
family
but
the
poor
soul
was
uneducated
and
it
could
not
be
helped
all
the
same
you
cannot
tell
how
prejudice
will
drive
one
to
the
extremes
kiyo
seemed
quite
sure
that
some
day
i
would
achieve
high
position
in
society
and
become
famous
equally
she
was
sure
that
my
brother
who
was
spending
his
hours
studiously
was
only
good
for
his
white
skin
and
would
stand
no
show
in
the
future
nothing
can
beat
an
old
woman
for
this
sort
of
thing
i
tell
you
she
firmly
believed
that
whoever
she
liked
would
become
famous
while
whoever
she
hated
would
not
i
did
not
have
at
that
time
any
particular
object
in
my
life
but
the
persistency
with
which
kiyo
declared
that
i
would
be
a
great
man
some
day
made
me
speculate
myself
that
after
all
i
might
become
one
how
absurd
it
seems
to
me
now
when
i
recall
those
days
i
asked
her
once
what
kind
of
a
man
i
should
be
but
she
seemed
to
have
formed
no
concrete
idea
as
to
that
only
she
said
that
i
was
sure
to
live
in
a
house
with
grand
entrance
hall
and
ride
in
a
private
rikisha
and
kiyo
seemed
to
have
decided
for
herself
to
live
with
me
when
i
became
independent
and
occupy
my
own
house
please
let
me
live
with
you
she
repeatedly
asked
of
me
feeling
somewhat
that
i
should
eventually
be
able
to
own
a
house
i
answered
her
yes
as
far
as
such
an
answer
went
this
woman
by
the
way
was
strongly
imaginative
she
questioned
me
what
place
i
liked
kojimachi
ku
or
azabu
ku
and
suggested
that
i
should
have
a
swing
in
our
garden
that
one
room
be
enough
for
european
style
etc
planning
everything
to
suit
her
own
fancy
i
did
not
then
care
a
straw
for
anything
like
a
house
so
neither
japanese
nor
european
style
was
much
of
use
to
me
and
i
told
her
to
that
effect
then
she
would
praise
me
as
uncovetous
and
clean
of
heart
whatever
i
said
she
had
praise
for
me
i
lived
after
the
death
of
mother
in
this
fashion
for
five
or
six
years
i
had
kicks
from
father
had
rows
with
brother
and
had
candies
and
praise
from
kiyo
i
cared
for
nothing
more
i
thought
this
was
enough
i
imagined
all
other
boys
were
leading
about
the
same
kind
of
life
as
kiyo
frequently
told
me
however
that
i
was
to
be
pitied
and
was
unfortunate
i
imagined
that
that
might
be
so
there
was
nothing
that
particularly
worried
me
except
that
father
was
too
tight
with
my
pocket
money
and
this
was
rather
hard
on
me
in
january
of
the
6th
year
after
mother
s
death
father
died
of
apoplexy
in
april
of
the
same
year
i
graduated
from
a
middle
school
and
two
months
later
my
brother
graduated
from
a
business
college
soon
he
obtained
a
job
in
the
kyushu
branch
of
a
certain
firm
and
had
to
go
there
while
i
had
to
remain
in
tokyo
and
continue
my
study
he
proposed
the
sale
of
our
house
and
the
realization
of
our
property
to
which
i
answered
just
as
you
like
it
i
had
no
intention
of
depending
upon
him
anyway
even
were
he
to
look
after
me
i
was
sure
of
his
starting
something
which
would
eventually
end
in
a
smash
up
as
we
were
prone
to
quarrel
on
the
least
pretext
it
was
because
in
order
to
receive
his
protection
that
i
should
have
to
bow
before
such
a
fellow
that
i
resolved
that
i
would
live
by
myself
even
if
i
had
to
do
milk
delivery
shortly
afterwards
he
sent
for
a
second
hand
dealer
and
sold
for
a
song
all
the
bric
a
bric
which
had
been
handed
down
from
ages
ago
in
our
family
our
house
and
lot
were
sold
through
the
efforts
of
a
middleman
to
a
wealthy
person
this
transaction
seemed
to
have
netted
a
goodly
sum
to
him
but
i
know
nothing
as
to
the
detail
for
one
month
previous
to
this
i
had
been
rooming
in
a
boarding
house
in
kanda
ku
pending
a
decision
as
to
my
future
course
kiyo
was
greatly
grieved
to
see
the
house
in
which
she
had
lived
so
many
years
change
ownership
but
she
was
helpless
in
the
matter
if
you
were
a
little
older
you
might
have
inherited
this
house
she
once
remarked
in
earnest
if
i
could
have
inherited
the
house
through
being
a
little
older
i
ought
to
have
been
able
to
inherit
the
house
right
then
she
knew
nothing
and
believed
the
lack
of
age
only
prevented
my
coming
into
the
possession
of
the
house
thus
i
parted
from
my
brother
but
the
disposal
of
kiyo
was
a
difficult
proposition
my
brother
was
of
course
unable
to
take
her
along
nor
was
there
any
danger
of
her
following
him
so
far
away
as
kyushu
while
i
was
in
a
small
room
of
a
boarding
house
and
might
have
to
clear
out
anytime
at
that
there
was
no
way
out
so
i
asked
her
if
she
intended
to
work
somewhere
else
finally
she
answered
me
definitely
that
she
would
go
to
her
nephew
s
and
wait
until
i
started
my
own
house
and
get
married
this
nephew
was
a
clerk
in
the
court
of
justice
and
being
fairly
well
off
had
invited
kiyo
before
more
than
once
to
come
and
live
with
him
but
kiyo
preferred
to
stay
with
us
even
as
a
servant
since
she
had
become
well
used
to
our
family
but
now
i
think
she
thought
it
better
to
go
over
to
her
nephew
than
to
start
a
new
life
as
servant
in
a
strange
house
be
that
as
it
may
she
advised
me
to
have
my
own
household
soon
or
get
married
so
she
would
come
and
help
me
in
housekeeping
i
believe
she
liked
me
more
than
she
did
her
own
kin
my
brother
came
to
me
two
days
previous
to
his
departure
for
kyushu
and
giving
me
600
yen
said
that
i
might
begin
a
business
with
it
or
go
ahead
with
my
study
or
spend
it
in
any
way
i
liked
but
that
that
would
be
the
last
he
could
spare
it
was
a
commendable
act
for
my
brother
what
about
only
600
yen
i
could
get
along
without
it
i
thought
but
as
this
unusually
simple
manner
appealed
to
me
i
accepted
the
offer
with
thanks
then
he
produced
50
yen
requesting
me
to
give
it
to
kiyo
next
time
i
saw
her
which
i
readily
complied
with
two
days
after
i
saw
him
off
at
the
shimbashi
station
and
have
not
set
my
eyes
on
him
ever
since
lying
in
my
bed
i
meditated
on
the
best
way
to
spend
that
600
yen
a
business
is
fraught
with
too
much
trouble
and
besides
it
was
not
my
calling
moreover
with
only
600
yen
no
one
could
open
a
business
worth
the
name
were
i
even
able
to
do
it
i
was
far
from
being
educated
and
after
all
would
lose
it
better
let
investments
alone
but
study
more
with
the
money
dividing
the
600
yen
into
three
and
by
spending
200
yen
a
year
i
could
study
for
three
years
if
i
kept
at
one
study
with
bull
dog
tenacity
for
three
years
i
should
be
able
to
learn
something
then
the
selection
of
a
school
was
the
next
problem
by
nature
there
is
no
branch
of
study
whatever
which
appeals
to
my
taste
nix
on
languages
or
literature
the
new
poetry
was
all
greek
to
me
i
could
not
make
out
one
single
line
of
twenty
since
i
detested
every
kind
of
study
any
kind
of
study
should
have
been
the
same
to
me
thinking
thus
i
happened
to
pass
front
of
a
school
of
physics
and
seeing
a
sign
posted
for
the
admittance
of
more
students
i
thought
this
might
be
a
kind
of
affinity
and
having
asked
for
the
prospectus
at
once
filed
my
application
for
entrance
when
i
think
of
it
now
it
was
a
blunder
due
to
my
hereditary
recklessness
for
three
years
i
studied
about
as
diligently
as
ordinary
fellows
but
not
being
of
a
particularly
brilliant
quality
my
standing
in
the
class
was
easier
to
find
by
looking
up
from
the
bottom
strange
isn
t
it
that
when
three
years
were
over
i
graduated
i
had
to
laugh
at
myself
but
there
being
no
reason
for
complaint
i
passed
out
eight
days
after
my
graduation
the
principal
of
the
school
asked
me
to
come
over
and
see
him
i
wondered
what
he
wanted
and
went
a
middle
school
in
shikoku
was
in
need
of
a
teacher
of
mathematics
for
forty
yen
a
month
and
he
sounded
me
to
see
if
i
would
take
it
i
had
studied
for
three
years
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
no
intention
of
either
teaching
or
going
to
the
country
having
nothing
in
sight
however
except
teaching
i
readily
accepted
the
offer
this
too
was
a
blunder
due
to
hereditary
recklessness
i
accepted
the
position
and
so
must
go
there
the
three
years
of
my
school
life
i
had
seen
confined
in
a
small
room
but
with
no
kick
coming
or
having
no
rough
house
it
was
a
comparatively
easy
going
period
in
my
life
but
now
i
had
to
pack
up
once
i
went
to
kamakura
on
a
picnic
with
my
classmates
while
i
was
in
the
grammar
school
and
that
was
the
first
and
last
so
far
that
i
stepped
outside
of
tokyo
since
i
could
remember
this
time
i
must
go
darn
far
away
that
it
beats
kamakura
by
a
mile
the
prospective
town
is
situated
on
the
coast
and
looked
the
size
of
a
needle
point
on
the
map
it
would
not
be
much
to
look
at
anyway
i
knew
nothing
about
the
place
or
the
people
there
it
did
not
worry
me
or
cause
any
anxiety
i
had
simply
to
travel
there
and
that
was
the
annoying
part
once
in
a
while
since
our
house
was
no
more
i
went
to
kiyo
s
nephew
s
to
see
her
her
nephew
was
unusually
good
natured
and
whenever
i
called
upon
her
he
treated
me
well
if
he
happened
to
be
at
home
kiyo
would
boost
me
sky
high
to
her
nephew
right
to
my
face
she
went
so
far
once
as
to
say
that
when
i
had
graduated
from
school
i
would
purchase
a
house
somewhere
in
kojimachi
ku
and
get
a
position
in
a
government
office
she
decided
everything
in
her
own
way
and
talked
of
it
aloud
and
i
was
made
an
unwilling
and
bashful
listener
i
do
not
know
how
her
nephew
weighed
her
tales
of
self
indulgence
on
me
kiyo
was
a
woman
of
the
old
type
and
seemed
as
if
it
was
still
the
days
of
feudal
lords
to
regard
her
nephew
equally
under
obligation
to
me
even
as
she
was
herself
after
settling
about
my
new
position
i
called
upon
her
three
days
previous
to
my
departure
she
was
sick
abed
in
a
small
room
but
on
seeing
me
she
got
up
and
immediately
inquired
master
darling
when
do
you
begin
housekeeping
she
evidently
thought
as
soon
as
a
fellow
finishes
school
money
comes
to
his
pocket
by
itself
but
then
how
absurd
to
call
such
a
great
man
darling
i
told
her
simply
that
i
should
let
the
house
proposition
go
for
some
time
as
i
had
to
go
to
the
country
she
looked
greatly
disappointed
and
blankly
smoothed
her
gray
haired
sidelocks
i
felt
sorry
for
her
and
said
comfortingly
i
am
going
away
but
will
come
back
soon
i
ll
return
in
the
vacation
next
summer
sure
still
as
she
appeared
not
fully
satisfied
i
added
will
bring
you
back
a
surprise
what
do
you
like
she
wished
to
eat
sasa
ame
[1]
of
echigo
province
i
had
never
heard
of
sasa
ame
of
echigo
to
begin
with
the
location
is
entirely
different
[footnote

sasa
ame
is
a
kind
of
rice
jelly
wrapped
with
sasa
or
the
bamboo
leaves
well
known
as
a
product
of
echigo
province
]
there
seems
to
be
no
sasa
ame
in
the
country
where
i
m
going
i
explained
and
she
rejoined
then
in
what
direction
i
answered
westward
and
she
came
back
with
is
it
on
the
other
side
of
hakone
this
give
and
take
conversation
proved
too
much
for
me
on
the
day
of
my
departure
she
came
to
my
room
early
in
the
morning
and
helped
me
to
pack
up
she
put
into
my
carpet
bag
tooth
powder
tooth
brush
and
towels
which
she
said
she
had
bought
at
a
dry
goods
store
on
her
way
i
protested
that
i
did
not
want
them
but
she
was
insistent
[a]
we
rode
in
rikishas
to
the
station
coming
up
the
platform
she
gazed
at
me
from
outside
the
car
and
said
in
a
low
voice
this
may
be
our
last
good
by
take
care
of
yourself
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
did
not
cry
but
was
almost
going
to
after
the
train
had
run
some
distance
thinking
it
would
be
all
right
now
i
poked
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
looked
back
she
was
still
there
she
looked
very
small
chapter
ii
with
a
long
sonorous
whistle
the
steamer
which
i
was
aboard
came
to
a
standstill
and
a
boat
was
seen
making
toward
us
from
the
shore
the
man
rowing
the
boat
was
stark
naked
except
for
a
piece
of
red
cloth
girt
round
his
loins
a
barbarous
place
this
though
he
may
have
been
excused
for
it
in
such
hot
weather
as
it
was
the
sun
s
rays
were
strong
and
the
water
glimmered
in
such
strange
colors
as
to
dazzle
one
s
sight
if
gazed
at
it
for
long
i
had
been
told
by
a
clerk
of
the
ship
that
i
was
to
get
off
here
the
place
looked
like
a
fishing
village
about
the
size
of
omori
great
scott
i
wouldn
t
stay
in
such
a
hole
i
thought
but
i
had
to
get
out
so
down
i
jumped
first
into
the
boat
and
i
think
five
or
six
others
followed
me
after
loading
about
four
large
boxes
besides
the
red
cloth
rowed
us
ashore
when
the
boat
struck
the
sand
i
was
again
the
first
to
jump
out
and
right
away
i
accosted
a
skinny
urchin
standing
nearby
asking
him
where
the
middle
school
was
the
kid
answered
blankly
that
he
did
not
know
confound
the
dull
head
not
to
know
where
the
middle
school
was
living
in
such
a
tiny
bit
of
a
town
then
a
man
wearing
a
rig
with
short
queer
shaped
sleeves
approached
me
and
bade
me
follow
i
walked
after
him
and
was
taken
to
an
inn
called
minato
ya
the
maids
of
the
inn
who
gave
me
a
disagreeable
impression
chorused
at
sight
of
me
please
step
inside
this
discouraged
me
in
proceeding
further
and
i
asked
them
standing
at
the
door
way
to
show
me
the
middle
school
on
being
told
that
the
middle
school
was
about
four
miles
away
by
rail
i
became
still
more
discouraged
at
putting
up
there
i
snatched
my
two
valises
from
the
man
with
queer
shaped
[b]
sleeves
who
had
guided
me
so
far
and
strode
away
the
people
of
the
inn
looked
after
me
with
a
dazed
expression
the
station
was
easily
found
and
a
ticket
bought
without
any
fuss
the
coach
i
got
in
was
about
as
dignified
as
a
match
box
the
train
rambled
on
for
about
five
minutes
and
then
i
had
to
get
off
no
wonder
the
fare
was
cheap
it
cost
only
three
sen
i
then
hired
a
rikisha
and
arrived
at
the
middle
school
but
school
was
already
over
and
nobody
was
there
the
teacher
on
night
duty
was
out
just
for
a
while
said
the
janitor
the
night
watch
was
taking
life
easy
sure
i
thought
of
visiting
the
principal
but
being
tired
ordered
the
rikishaman
to
take
me
to
a
hotel
he
did
this
with
much
alacrity
and
led
me
to
a
hotel
called
yamashiro
ya
i
felt
it
rather
amusing
to
find
the
name
yamashiro
ya
the
same
as
that
of
kantaro
s
house
they
ushered
me
to
a
dark
room
below
the
stairway
no
one
could
stay
in
such
a
hot
place
i
said
i
did
not
like
such
a
warm
room
but
the
maid
dumped
my
valises
on
the
floor
and
left
me
mumbling
that
all
the
other
rooms
were
occupied
so
i
took
the
room
though
it
took
some
resolution
to
stand
the
weltering
heat
after
a
while
the
maid
said
the
bath
was
ready
and
i
took
one
on
my
way
back
from
the
bathroom
i
peeped
about
and
found
many
rooms
which
looked
much
cooler
than
mine
vacant
sunnovagun
they
had
lied
by
m
by
she
fetched
my
supper
although
the
room
was
hot
the
meal
was
a
deal
better
than
the
kind
i
used
to
have
in
my
boarding
house
while
waiting
on
me
she
questioned
me
where
i
was
from
and
i
said
from
tokyo
then
she
asked
isn
t
tokyo
a
nice
place
and
i
shot
back
bet
tis
about
the
time
the
maid
had
reached
the
kitchen
loud
laughs
were
heard
there
was
nothing
doing
so
i
went
to
bed
but
could
not
sleep
not
only
was
it
hot
but
noisy
about
five
times
noisier
than
my
boarding
house
while
snoozing
i
dreamed
of
kiyo
she
was
eating
sasa
ame
of
echigo
province
without
taking
off
the
wrapper
of
bamboo
leaves
i
tried
to
stop
her
saying
bamboo
leaves
may
do
her
harm
but
she
replied
o
no
these
leaves
are
very
helpful
for
the
health
and
ate
them
with
much
relish
astounded
i
laughed
ha
ha
ha
and
so
awoke
the
maid
was
opening
the
outside
shutters
the
weather
was
just
as
clear
as
the
previous
day
i
had
heard
once
before
that
when
travelling
one
should
give
tea
money
to
the
hotel
or
inn
where
he
stops
that
unless
this
tea
money
is
given
the
hostelry
would
accord
him
rather
rough
treatment
it
must
have
been
on
account
of
my
being
slow
in
the
fork
over
of
this
tea
money
that
they
had
huddled
me
into
such
a
narrow
dark
room
likewise
my
shabby
clothes
and
the
carpet
bags
and
satin
umbrella
must
have
been
accountable
for
it
took
me
for
a
piker
eh
those
hayseeds
i
would
give
them
a
knocker
with
tea
money
i
left
tokyo
with
about
30
yen
in
my
pocket
which
remained
from
my
school
expenses
taking
off
the
railway
and
steamship
fare
and
other
incidental
expenses
i
had
still
about
14
yen
in
my
pocket
i
could
give
them
all
i
had
what
did
i
care
i
was
going
to
get
a
salary
now
all
country
folk
are
tight
wads
and
one
5
yen
bill
would
hit
them
square
now
watch
and
see
having
washed
myself
i
returned
to
my
room
and
waited
and
the
maid
of
the
night
before
brought
in
my
breakfast
waiting
on
me
with
a
tray
she
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
sulphuric
smile
rude
is
any
parade
marching
on
my
face
i
should
say
even
my
face
is
far
better
than
that
of
the
maid
i
intended
of
giving
tea
money
after
breakfast
but
i
became
disgusted
and
taking
out
one
5
yen
bill
told
her
to
take
it
to
the
office
later
the
face
of
the
maid
became
then
shy
and
awkward
after
the
meal
i
left
for
the
school
the
maid
did
not
have
my
shoes
polished
i
had
had
vague
idea
of
the
direction
of
the
school
as
i
rode
to
it
the
previous
day
so
turning
two
or
three
corners
i
came
to
the
front
gate
from
the
gate
to
the
entrance
the
walk
was
paved
with
granite
when
i
had
passed
to
the
entrance
in
the
rikisha
this
walk
made
so
outlandishly
a
loud
noise
that
i
had
felt
coy
on
my
way
to
the
school
i
met
a
number
of
the
students
in
uniforms
of
cotton
drill
and
they
all
entered
this
gate
some
of
them
were
taller
than
i
and
looked
much
stronger
when
i
thought
of
teaching
fellows
of
this
ilk
i
was
impressed
with
a
queer
sort
of
uneasiness
my
card
was
taken
to
the
principal
to
whose
room
i
was
ushered
at
once
with
scant
mustache
dark
skinned
and
big
eyed
the
principal
was
a
man
who
looked
like
a
badger
he
studiously
assumed
an
air
of
superiority
and
saying
he
would
like
to
see
me
do
my
best
handed
the
note
of
appointment
stamped
big
in
a
solemn
manner
this
note
i
threw
away
into
the
sea
on
my
way
back
to
tokyo
he
said
he
would
introduce
me
to
all
my
fellow
teachers
and
i
was
to
show
to
each
one
of
them
the
note
of
appointment
what
a
bother
it
would
be
far
better
to
stick
this
note
up
in
the
teachers
room
for
three
days
instead
of
going
through
such
a
monkey
process
the
teachers
would
not
be
all
in
the
room
until
the
bugle
for
the
first
hour
was
sounded
there
was
plenty
of
time
the
principal
took
out
his
watch
and
saying
that
he
would
acquaint
me
particularly
with
the
school
by
and
bye
he
would
only
furnish
me
now
with
general
matters
and
started
a
long
lecture
on
the
spirit
of
education
for
a
while
i
listened
to
him
with
my
mind
half
away
somewhere
else
but
about
half
way
through
his
lecture
i
began
to
realize
that
i
should
soon
be
in
a
bad
fix
i
could
not
do
by
any
means
all
he
expected
of
me
he
expected
that
i
should
make
myself
an
example
to
the
students
should
become
an
object
of
admiration
for
the
whole
school
or
should
exert
my
moral
influence
besides
teaching
technical
knowledge
in
order
to
become
a
real
educator
or
something
ridiculously
high
sounding
no
man
with
such
admirable
qualities
would
come
so
far
away
for
only
40
yen
a
month
men
are
generally
alike
if
one
gets
excited
one
is
liable
to
fight
i
thought
but
if
things
are
to
be
kept
on
in
the
way
the
principal
says
i
could
hardly
open
my
mouth
to
utter
anything
nor
take
a
stroll
around
the
place
if
they
wanted
me
to
fill
such
an
onerous
post
they
should
have
told
all
that
before
i
hate
to
tell
a
lie
i
would
give
it
up
as
having
been
cheated
and
get
out
of
this
mess
like
a
man
there
and
then
i
had
only
about
9
yen
left
in
my
pocket
after
tipping
the
hotel
5
yen
nine
yen
would
not
take
me
back
to
tokyo
i
had
better
not
have
tipped
the
hotel
what
a
pity
however
i
would
be
able
to
manage
it
somehow
i
considered
it
better
to
run
short
in
my
return
expenses
than
to
tell
a
lie
i
cannot
do
it
the
way
you
want
me
to
i
return
this
appointment
i
shoved
back
the
note
the
principal
winked
his
badger
like
eyes
and
gazed
at
me
then
he
said
what
i
have
said
just
now
is
what
i
desire
of
you
i
know
well
that
you
cannot
do
all
i
want
so
don
t
worry
and
he
laughed
if
he
knew
it
so
well
already
what
on
earth
did
he
scare
me
for
meanwhile
the
bugle
sounded
being
followed
by
bustling
noises
in
the
direction
of
the
class
rooms
all
the
teachers
would
be
now
ready
i
was
told
and
i
followed
the
principal
to
the
teachers
room
in
a
spacious
rectangular
room
they
sat
each
before
a
table
lined
along
the
walls
when
i
entered
the
room
they
all
glanced
at
me
as
if
by
previous
agreement
did
they
think
my
face
was
for
a
show
then
as
per
instructions
i
introduced
myself
and
showed
the
note
to
each
one
of
them
most
of
them
left
their
chairs
and
made
a
slight
bow
of
acknowledgment
but
some
of
the
more
painfully
polite
took
the
note
and
read
it
and
respectfully
returned
it
to
me
just
like
the
cheap
performances
at
a
rural
show
when
i
came
to
the
fifteenth
who
was
the
teacher
of
physical
training
i
became
impatient
at
repeating
the
same
old
thing
so
often
the
other
side
had
to
do
it
only
once
but
my
side
had
to
do
it
fifteen
times
they
ought
to
have
had
some
sympathy
among
those
i
met
in
the
room
there
was
mr
blank
who
was
head
teacher
said
he
was
a
bachelor
of
arts
i
suppose
he
was
a
great
man
since
he
was
a
graduate
from
imperial
university
and
had
such
a
title
he
talked
in
a
strangely
effeminate
voice
like
a
woman
but
what
surprised
me
most
was
that
he
wore
a
flannel
shirt
however
thin
it
might
be
flannel
is
flannel
and
must
have
been
pretty
warm
at
that
time
of
the
year
what
painstaking
dress
is
required
which
will
be
becoming
to
a
b
a
and
it
was
a
red
shirt
wouldn
t
that
kill
you
i
heard
afterwards
that
he
wears
a
red
shirt
all
the
year
round
what
a
strange
affliction
according
to
his
own
explanation
he
has
his
shirts
made
to
order
for
the
sake
of
his
health
as
the
red
color
is
beneficial
to
the
physical
condition
unnecessary
worry
this
for
that
being
the
case
he
should
have
had
his
coat
and
hakama
also
in
red
and
there
was
one
mr
koga
teacher
of
english
whose
complexion
was
very
pale
pale
faced
people
are
usually
thin
but
this
man
was
pale
and
fat
when
i
was
attending
grammar
school
there
was
one
tami
asai
in
our
class
and
his
father
was
just
as
pale
as
this
koga
asai
was
a
farmer
and
i
asked
kiyo
if
one
s
face
would
become
pale
if
he
took
up
farming
kiyo
said
it
was
not
so
asai
ate
always
hubbard
squash
of
uranari
[2]
and
that
was
the
reason
thereafter
when
i
saw
any
man
pale
and
fat
i
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
the
result
of
his
having
eaten
too
much
of
squash
of
uranari
this
english
teacher
was
surely
subsisting
upon
squash
however
what
the
meaning
of
uranari
is
i
do
not
know
i
asked
kiyo
once
but
she
only
laughed
probably
she
did
not
know
among
the
teachers
of
mathematics
there
was
one
named
hotta
this
was
a
fellow
of
massive
body
with
hair
closely
cropped
he
looked
like
one
of
the
old
time
devilish
priests
who
made
the
eizan
temple
famous
i
showed
him
the
note
politely
but
he
did
not
even
look
at
it
and
blurted
out
you
re
the
man
newly
appointed
eh
come
and
see
me
sometime
ha
ha
ha
[footnote
2
means
the
last
crop
]
devil
take
his
ha
ha
ha
who
would
go
to
see
a
fellow
so
void
of
the
sense
of
common
decency
i
gave
this
priest
from
this
time
the
nickname
of
porcupine
the
confucian
teacher
was
strict
in
his
manner
as
becoming
to
his
profession
arrived
yesterday
you
must
be
tired
start
teaching
already
working
hard
indeed
and
so
on
he
was
an
old
man
quite
sociable
and
talkative
the
teacher
of
drawing
was
altogether
like
a
cheap
actor
he
wore
a
thin
flappy
haori
of
sukiya
and
toying
with
a
fan
he
giggled
where
from
eh
tokyo
glad
to
hear
that
you
make
another
of
our
group
i
m
a
tokyo
kid
myself
if
such
a
fellow
prided
himself
on
being
a
tokyo
kid
i
wished
i
had
never
been
born
in
tokyo
i
might
go
on
writing
about
each
one
of
them
for
there
are
many
but
i
stop
here
otherwise
there
will
be
no
end
to
it
when
my
formal
introduction
was
over
the
principal
said
that
i
might
go
for
the
day
but
i
should
make
arrangements
as
to
the
class
hours
etc
with
the
head
teacher
of
mathematics
and
begin
teaching
from
the
day
after
the
morrow
asked
who
was
the
head
teacher
of
mathematics
i
found
that
he
was
no
other
than
that
porcupine
holy
smokes
was
i
to
serve
under
him
i
was
disappointed
say
where
are
you
stopping
yamashiro
ya
well
i
ll
come
and
talk
it
over
so
saying
porcupine
chalk
in
hand
left
the
room
to
his
class
that
was
rather
humiliating
for
a
head
teacher
to
come
over
and
see
his
subordinate
but
it
was
better
than
to
call
me
over
to
him
after
leaving
the
school
i
thought
of
returning
straight
to
the
hotel
but
as
there
was
nothing
to
do
i
decided
to
take
in
a
little
of
the
town
and
started
walking
about
following
my
nose
i
saw
prefectural
building
it
was
an
old
structure
of
the
last
century
also
i
saw
the
barracks
they
were
less
imposing
than
those
of
the
azabu
regiment
tokyo
i
passed
through
the
main
street
the
width
of
the
street
is
about
one
half
that
of
kagurazaka
and
its
aspect
is
inferior
what
about
a
castle
town
of
250
000
koku
lord
pity
the
fellows
who
get
swell
headed
in
such
a
place
as
a
castle
town
while
i
walked
about
musing
like
this
i
found
myself
in
front
of
yamashiro
ya
the
town
was
much
narrower
than
i
had
been
led
to
believe
i
think
i
have
seen
nearly
all
guess
i
ll
return
and
eat
and
i
entered
the
gate
the
mistress
of
the
hotel
who
was
sitting
at
the
counter
jumped
out
of
her
place
at
my
appearance
and
with
are
you
back
sire
scraped
the
floor
with
her
forehead
when
i
took
my
shoes
off
and
stepped
inside
the
maid
took
me
to
an
upstairs
room
that
had
became
vacant
it
was
a
front
room
of
15
mats
about
90
square
feet
i
had
never
before
lived
in
so
splendid
a
room
as
this
as
it
was
quite
uncertain
when
i
should
again
be
able
to
occupy
such
a
room
in
future
i
took
off
my
european
dress
and
with
only
a
single
japanese
summer
coat
on
sprawled
in
the
centre
of
the
room
in
the
shape
of
the
japanese
letter
big
arms
stretched
out
and
legs
spread
wide[d]
i
found
it
very
refreshing
after
luncheon
i
at
once
wrote
a
letter
to
kiyo
i
hate
most
to
write
letters
because
i
am
poor
at
sentence
making
and
also
poor
in
my
stock
of
words
neither
did
i
have
any
place
to
which
to
address
my
letters
however
kiyo
might
be
getting
anxious
it
would
not
do
to
let
her
worry
lest
she
think
the
steamer
which
i
boarded
had
been
wrecked
and
i
was
drowned
so
i
braced
up
and
wrote
a
long
one
the
body
of
the
letter
was
as
follows
arrived
yesterday
a
dull
place
am
sleeping
in
a
room
of
15
mats
tipped
the
hotel
five
yen
as
tea
money
the
house
wife
of
the
hotel
scraped
the
floor
with
her
forehead
couldn
t
sleep
last
night
dreamed
kiyo
eat
sasa
ame
together
with
the
bamboo
leaf
wrappers
will
return
next
summer
went
to
the
school
to
day
and
nicknamed
all
the
fellows
badger
for
the
principal
red
shirt
for
the
head
teacher
hubbard
squash
for
the
teacher
of
english
porcupine
the
teacher
of
mathematics
and
clown
for
that
of
drawing
will
write
you
many
other
things
soon
good
bye
when
i
finished
writing
the
letter
i
felt
better
and
sleepy
so
i
slept
in
the
centre
of
the
room
as
i
had
done
before
in
the
letter
big
shape
[d]
no
dream
this
time
and
i
had
a
sound
sleep
is
this
the
room
a
loud
voice
was
heard
a
voice
which
woke
me
up
and
porcupine
entered
how
do
you
do
what
you
have
to
do
in
the
school
he
began
talking
shop
as
soon
as
i
got
up
and
rattled
me
much
on
learning
my
duties
in
the
school
there
seemed
to
be
no
difficulty
and
i
decided
to
accept
if
only
such
were
what
was
expected
of
me
i
would
not
be
surprised
were
i
told
to
start
not
only
two
days
hence
but
even
from
the
following
day
the
talk
on
business
over
porcupine
said
that
he
did
not
think
it
was
my
intention
to
stay
in
such
a
hotel
all
the
time
that
he
would
find
a
room
for
me
in
a
good
boarding
house
and
that
i
should
move
they
wouldn
t
take
in
another
from
anybody
else
but
i
can
do
it
right
away
the
sooner
the
better
go
and
look
at
the
room
to
day
move
tomorrow
and
start
teaching
from
the
next
day
that
ll
be
all
nice
and
settled
he
seemed
satisfied
by
arranging
all
by
himself
indeed
i
should
not
be
able
to
occupy
such
a
room
for
long
i
might
have
to
blow
in
all
of
my
salary
for
the
hotel
bill
and
yet
be
short
of
squaring
it
it
was
pity
to
leave
the
hotel
so
soon
after
i
had
just
shone
with
a
5
yen
tip
however
it
being
decidedly
convenient
to
move
and
get
settled
early
if
i
had
to
move
at
all
i
asked
porcupine
to
get
that
room
for
me
he
told
me
then
to
come
over
with
him
and
see
the
house
at
any
rate
and
i
did
the
house
was
situated
mid
way
up
a
hill
at
the
end
of
the
town
and
was
a
quiet
the
boss
was
said
to
be
a
dealer
in
antique
curios
called
ikagin
and
his
wife
was
about
four
years
his
senior
i
learned
the
english
word
witch
when
i
was
in
middle
school
and
this
woman
looked
exactly
like
one
but
as
she
was
another
man
s
wife
what
did
i
care
if
she
was
a
witch
finally
i
decided
to
live
in
the
house
from
the
next
day
on
our
way
back
porcupine
treated
me
to
a
cup
of
ice
water
when
i
first
met
him
in
the
school
i
thought
him
a
disgustingly
overbearing
fellow
but
judging
by
the
way
he
had
looked
after
me
so
far
he
appeared
not
so
bad
after
all
only
he
seemed
like
me
impatient
by
nature
and
of
quick
temper
i
heard
afterward
that
he
was
liked
most
by
all
the
students
in
the
school
chapter
iii
my
teaching
began
at
last
when
i
entered
the
class
room
and
stepped
upon
the
platform
for
the
first
time
i
felt
somewhat
strange
while
lecturing
i
wondered
if
a
fellow
like
me
could
keep
up
the
profession
of
public
instructor
the
students
were
noisy
once
in
a
while
they
would
holler
teacher
teacher
it
was
going
some
i
had
been
calling
others
teacher
every
day
so
far
in
the
school
of
physics
but
in
calling
others
teacher
and
being
called
one
there
is
a
wide
gap
of
difference
it
made
me
feel
as
if
some
one
was
tickling
my
soles
i
am
not
a
sneakish
fellow
nor
a
coward
only
it
s
a
pity
i
lack
audacity
if
one
calls
me
teacher
aloud
it
gives
me
a
shock
similar
to
that
of
hearing
the
noon
gun
in
marunouchi
when
i
was
hungry
the
first
hour
passed
away
in
a
dashing
manner
and
it
passed
away
without
encountering
any
knotty
questions
as
i
returned
to
the
teachers
room
porcupine
asked
me
how
it
was
i
simply
answered
well
and
he
seemed
satisfied
when
i
left
the
teachers
room
chalk
in
hand
for
the
second
hour
class
i
felt
as
if
i
was
invading
the
enemy
s
territory
on
entering
the
room
i
found
the
students
for
this
hour
were
all
big
fellows
i
am
a
tokyo
kid
delicately
built
and
small
and
did
not
appear
very
impressive
even
in
my
elevated
position
if
it
comes
to
a
scraping
i
can
hold
my
own
even
with
wrestlers
but
i
had
no
means
of
appearing
awe
inspiring[e]
merely
by
the
aid
of
my
tongue
to
so
many
as
forty
such
big
chaps
before
me
believing
however
that
it
would
set
a
bad
precedent
to
show
these
country
fellows
any
weakness
i
lectured
rather
loudly
and
in
brusque
tone
during
the
first
part
the
students
were
taken
aback
and
listened
literally
with
their
mouths
open
that
s
one
on
you
i
thought
elated
by
my
success
i
kept
on
in
this
tone
when
one
who
looked
the
strongest
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
stood
up
suddenly
and
called
teacher
there
it
goes
i
thought
and
asked
him
what
it
was
a
ah
sa
ay
you
talk
too
quick
a
ah
ca
an
t
you
make
it
a
leetle
slow
a
ah
a
ah
ca
an
t
you
a
ah
was
altogether
dull
if
i
talk
too
fast
i
ll
make
it
slow
but
i
m
a
tokyo
fellow
and
can
t
talk
the
way
you
do
if
you
don
t
understand
it
better
wait
until
you
do
so
i
answered
him
in
this
way
the
second
hour
was
closed
better
than
i
had
expected
only
as
i
was
about
to
leave
the
class
one
of
the
students
asked
me
a
ah
say
won
t
you
please
do
them
for
me
and
showed
me
some
problems
in
geometry
which
i
was
sure
i
could
not
solve
this
proved
to
be
somewhat
a
damper
on
me
but
helpless
i
told
him
i
could
not
make
them
out
and
telling
him
that
i
would
show
him
how
next
time
hastily
got
out
of
the
room
and
all
of
them
raised
whee
ee
some
of
them
were
heard
saying
he
doesn
t
know
much
don
t
take
a
teacher
for
an
encyclopaedia
if
i
could
work
out
such
hard
questions
as
these
easily
i
would
not
be
in
such
a
backwoods
town
for
forty
yen
a
month
i
returned
to
the
teachers
room
how
was
it
this
time
asked
porcupine
i
said
umh
but
not
satisfied
with
umh
only
i
added
that
all
the
students
in
this
school
were
boneheads
he
put
up
a
whimsical
face
the
third
and
the
fourth
hour
and
the
first
hour
in
the
afternoon
were
more
or
less
the
same
in
all
the
classes
i
attended
i
made
some
kind
of
blunder
i
realised
that
the
profession
of
teaching
not
quite
so
easy
a
calling
as
might
have
appeared
my
teaching
for
the
day
was
finished
but
i
could
not
get
away
i
had
to
wait
alone
until
three
o
clock
i
understood
that
at
three
o
clock
the
students
of
my
classes
would
finish
cleaning
up
the
rooms
and
report
to
me
whereupon
i
would
go
over
the
rooms
then
i
would
run
through
the
students
roll
and
then
be
free
to
go
home
outrageous
indeed
to
keep
on
chained
to
the
school
staring
at
the
empty
space
when
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
even
though
he
was
bought
by
a
salary
other
fellow
teachers
however
meekly
submitted
to
the
regulation
and
believing
it
not
well
for
me
a
new
comer
to
fuss
about
it
i
stood
it
on
my
way
home
i
appealed
to
porcupine
as
to
the
absurdity
of
keeping
me
there
till
three
o
clock
regardless
of
my
having
nothing
to
do
in
the
school
he
said
yes
and
laughed
but
he
became
serious
and
in
an
advisory
manner
told
me
not
to
make
many
complaints
about
the
school
talk
to
me
only
if
you
want
to
there
are
some
queer
guys
around
as
we
parted
at
the
next
corner
i
did
not
have
time
to
hear
more
from
him
on
reaching
my
room
the
boss
of
the
house
came
to
me
saying
let
me
serve
you
tea
i
expected
he
was
going
to
treat
me
to
some
good
tea
since
he
said
let
me
serve
you
but
he
simply
made
himself
at
home
and
drank
my
own
tea
judging
by
this
i
thought
he
might
be
practising
let
me
serve
you
during
my
absence
the
boss
said
that
he
was
fond
of
antique
drawings
and
curios
and
finally
had
decided
to
start
in
that
business
you
look
like
one
quite
taken
about
art
suppose
you
begin
patronizing
my
business
just
for
fun
as
er
connoisseur
of
art
it
was
the
least
expected
kind
of
solicitation
two
years
ago
i
went
to
the
imperial
hotel
tokyo
on
an
errand
and
i
was
taken
for
a
locksmith
when
i
went
to
see
the
daibutsu
at
kamakura
haying
wrapped
up
myself
from
head
to
toe
with
a
blanket
a
rikisha
man
addressed
me
as
gov
ner
i
have
been
mistaken
on
many
occasions
for
as
many
things
but
none
so
far
has
counted
on
me
as
a
probable
connoisseur
of
art
one
should
know
better
by
my
appearance
any
one
who
aspires
to
be
a
patron
of
art
is
usually
pictured
you
may
see
in
any
drawing
with
either
a
hood
on
his
head
or
carrying
a
tanzaku[3]
in
his
hand
the
fellow
who
calls
me
a
connoisseur
of
art
and
pretends
to
mean
it
may
be
surely
as
crooked
as
a
dog
s
hind
legs
i
told
him
i
did
not
like
such
art
stuff
which
is
usually
favored
by
retired
people
he
laughed
and
remarking
that
that
nobody
liked
it
at
first
but
once
in
it
will
find
it
so
fascinating
that
he
will
hardly
get
over
it
served
tea
for
himself
and
drank
it
in
a
grotesque
manner
i
may
say
that
i
had
asked
him
the
night
before
to
buy
some
tea
for
me
but
i
did
not
like
such
a
bitter
heavy
kind
one
swallow
seemed
to
act
right
on
my
stomach
i
told
him
to
buy
a
kind
not
so
bitter
as
that
and
he
answered
all
right
sir
and
drank
another
cup
the
fellow
seemed
never
to
know
of
having
enough
of
anything
so
long
as
it
was
another
man
s
after
he
left
the
room
i
prepared
for
the
morrow
and
went
to
bed

poem

everyday
thereafter
i
attended
at
the
school
and
worked
as
per
regulations
every
day
on
my
return
the
boss
came
to
my
room
with
the
same
old
let
me
serve
you
tea
in
about
a
week
i
understood
the
school
in
a
general
way
and
had
my
own
idea
as
to
the
personality
of
the
boss
and
his
wife
i
heard
from
one
of
my
fellow
teachers
that
the
first
week
to
one
month
after
the
receipt
of
the
appointment
worried
them
most
as
to
whether
they
had
been
favorably
received
among
the
students
i
never
felt
anything
on
that
score
blunders
in
the
class
room
once
in
a
while
caused
me
chagrin
but
in
about
half
an
hour
everything
would
clear
out
of
my
head
i
am
a
fellow
who
by
nature
can
t
be
worrying
long
about[f]
anything
even
if
i
try
to
i
was
absolutely
indifferent
as
how
my
blunders
in
the
class
room
affected
the
students
or
how
much
further
they
affected
the
principal
or
the
head
teacher
as
i
mentioned
before
i
am
not
a
fellow
of
much
audacity
to
speak
of
but
i
am
quick
to
give
up
anything
when
i
see
its
finish
i
had
resolved
to
go
elsewhere
at
once
if
the
school
did
not
suit
me
in
consequence
neither
badger
nor
red
shirt
wielded
any
influence
over
me
and
still
less
did
i
feel
like
coaxing
or
coddling
the
youngsters
in
the
class
room
so
far
it
was
o
k
with
the
school
but
not
so
easy
as
that
at
my
boarding
house
i
could
have
stood
it
if
it
had
been
only
the
boss
coming
to
my
room
after
my
tea
but
he
would
fetch
many
things
to
my
room
first
time
he
brought
in
seals
[4]
he
displayed
about
ten
of
them
before
me
and
persuaded
me
to
buy
them
for
three
yen
which
was
very
cheap
he
said
did
he
take
me
for
a
third
rate
painter
making
a
round
of
the
country
i
told
him
i
did
not
want
them
next
time
he
brought
in
a
panel
picture
of
flowers
and
birds
drawn
by
one
kazan
or
somebody
he
hung
it
against
the
wall
of
the
alcove
and
asked
me
if
it
was
not
well
done
and
i
echoed
it
looked
well
done
then
he
started
lecturing
about
kazan
that
there
are
two
kazans
one
is
kazan
something
and
the
other
is
kazan
anything
and
that
this
picture
was
the
work
of
that
kazan
something
after
this
nonsensical
lecture
he
insisted
that
he
would
make
it
fifteen
yen
for
me
to
buy
it
i
declined
the
offer
saying
that
i
was
shy
of
the
money

you
can
pay
any
time
he
was
insistent
i
settled
him
by
telling
him
of
my
having
no
intention
of
purchasing
it
even
if
i
had
the
necessary
money
again
next
time
he
yanked
in
a
big
writing

slab
about
the
size
of
a

this
is

he
said
as
he
tankeied
two
or
three
times
i
asked
for
fun
what
was
a
tankei
right
away
he
commenced
lecturing
on
the
subject
there
are
the
upper
the
middle
and
the
lower
stratum
in
tankei
he
said
most
of
tankei
slabs
to

are
made
from
the
upper
stratum
he
continued
but
this
one
is
surely
from
the
middle
stratum

and
he
pushed
it
towards
me
i
asked
him
how
much
and
he
answered
that
on
account
of
its
owner
having
brought
it
from
china
and
wishing
to
sell
if
as
soon
as
possible
he
would
make
it
very
cheap
that
i
could
have
it
for
thirty
yen
i
was
sure
he
was
a
fool
i
seemed
to
be
able
to
get
through
the
school
somehow
but
i
would
soon
give
out
if
this
curio

kept
on
long

shortly
afterwards
i
began
to
get
sick
of
the
school
one
certain
night
while
i
was
strolling
about
a
street
named
omachi
i
happened
to
notice
a
sign
of
noodles
below
of
which
was
annotated
tokyo
in
the
house
next
to
the
post
office
i
am
very
fond
of
noodles
while
i
was
in
tokyo
if
i
passed
by
a
noodle
house
and
smelled
the
seasoning
spices
i
felt
uncontrollable
temptation
to
go
inside
at
any
cost
up
to
this
time
i
had
forgotten
the
noodle
on
account
of
mathematics
and
antique
curios
but
since
i
had
seen
thus
the
sign
of
noodles
i
could
hardly
pass
it
by
unnoticed
so
availing
myself
of
this
opportunity
i
went
in
it
was
not
quite
up
to
what
i
had
judged
by
the
sign
since
it
claimed
to
follow
the
tokyo
style
they
should
have
tidied
up
a
little
bit
about
the
room
they
did
not
either
know
tokyo
or
have
the
means
i
did
not
know
which
but
the
room
was
miserably
dirty
the
floor
mats
had
all
seen
better
days
and
felt
shaggy
with
sandy
dust
the
sootcovered
walls
defied
the
blackest
black
the
ceiling
was
not
only
smoked
by
the
lamp
black
but
was
so
low
as
to
force
one
involuntarily
bend
down
his
neck
only
the
price
list
on
which
was
glaringly
written
noodles
and
which
was
pasted
on
the
wall
was
entirely
new
i
was
certain
that
they
bought
an
old
house
and
opened
the
business
just
two
or
three
days
before
at
the
head
of
the
price
list
appeared
tempura
noodles
served
with
shrimp
fried
in
batter
say
fetch
me
some
tempura
i
ordered
in
a
loud
voice
then
three
fellows
who
had
been
making
a
chewing
noise
together
in
a
corner
looked
in
my
direction
as
the
room
was
dark
i
did
not
notice
them
at
first
but
when
we
looked
at
each
other
i
found
them
all
to
be
boys
in
our
school
they
how
d
ye
do
d
me
and
i
acknowledged
it
that
night
having
come
across
the
noodle
after
so
long
a
time
it
tasted
so
fine
that
i
ate
four
bowls
the
next
day
as
i
entered
the
class
room
quite
unconcernedly
i
saw
on
the
black
board
written
in
letters
so
large
as
to
take
up
the
whole
space
professor
tempura
the
boys
all
glanced
at
my
face
and
made
merry
hee
haws
at
my
cost
it
was
so
absurd
that
i
asked
them
if
it
was
in
any
way
funny
for
me
to
eat
tempura
noodle
thereupon
one
of
them
said
but
four
bowls
is
too
much
what
did
they
care
if
i
ate
four
bowls
or
five
as
long
as
i
paid
it
with
my
own
money
and
speedily
finishing
up
my
class
i
returned
to
the
teachers
room
after
ten
minutes
recess
i
went
to
the
next
class
and
there
on
the
black
board
was
newly
written
quite
as
large
as
before
four
bowls
of
tempura
noodles
but
don
t
laugh
the
first
one
did
not
arouse
any
ill
temper
in
me
but
this
time
it
made
me
feel
irritating
mad
a
joke
carried
too
far
becomes
mischievous
it
is
like
the
undue
jealousy
of
some
women
who
like
coal
look
black
and
suggest
flames
nobody
likes
it
these
country
simpletons
unable
to
differentiate
upon
so
delicate
a
boundary
would
seem
to
be
bent
on
pushing
everything
to
the
limit
as
they
lived
in
such
a
narrow
town
where
one
has
no
more
to
see
if
he
goes
on
strolling
about
for
one
hour
and
as
they
were
capable
of
doing
nothing
better
they
were
trumpeting
aloud
this
tempura
incident
in
quite
as
serious
a
manner
as
the
russo
japanese
war
what
a
bunch
of
miserable
pups
it
is
because
they
are
raised
in
this
fashion
from
their
boyhood
that
there
are
many
punies
who
like
the
dwarf
maple
tree
in
the
flower
pot
mature
gnarled
and
twisted
i
have
no
objection
to
laugh
myself
with
others
over
innocent
jokes
but
how
s
this
boys
as
they
are
they
showed
a
poisonous
temper
silently
erasing
off
tempura
from
the
board
i
questioned
them
if
they
thought
such
mischief
interesting
that
this
was
a
cowardly
joke
and
if
they
knew
the
meaning
of
cowardice
some
of
them
answered
that
to
get
angry
on
being
laughed
at
over
one
s
own
doing
was
cowardice
what
made
them
so
disgusting
as
this
i
pitied
myself
for
coming
from
far
off
tokyo
to
teach
such
a
lot
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
study
hard
i
snapped
and
started
the
class
in
the
next
class
again
there
was
written
when
one
eats
tempura
noodles
it
makes
him
drawl
nonsense
there
seemed
no
end
to
it
i
was
thoroughly
aroused
with
anger
and
declaring
that
i
would
not
teach
such
sassies
went
home
straight
the
boys
were
glad
of
having
an
unexpected
holiday
so
i
heard
when
things
had
come
to
this
pass
the
antique
curious
seemed
far
more
preferable
to
the
school
my
return
home
and
sleep
over
night
greatly
rounded
off
my
rugged
temper
over
the
tempura
affair
i
went
to
the
school
and
they
were
there
also
i
could
not
tell
what
was
what
the
three
days
thereafter
were
pacific
and
on
the
night
of
the
fourth
day
i
went
to
a
suburb
called
sumida
and
ate
dango
small
balls
made
of
glutinous
rice
dressed
with
sugar
paste
sumida
is
a
town
where
there
are
restaurants
hot
springs
bath
houses
and
a
park
and
in
addition
the
tenderloin
the
dango
shop
where
i
went
was
near
the
entrance
to
the
tenderloin
and
as
the
dango
served
there
was
widely
known
for
its
nice
taste
i
dropped
in
on
my
way
back
from
my
bath
as
i
did
not
meet
any
students
this
time
i
thought
nobody
knew
of
it
but
when
i
entered
the
first
hour
class
next
day
i
found
written
on
the
black
board
two
dishes
of
dango
7
sen
it
is
true
that
i
ate
two
dishes
and
paid
seven
sen
troublesome
kids
i
declare
i
expected
with
certainty
that
there
would
be
something
at
the
second
hour
and
there
it
was
the
dango
in
the
tenderloin
taste
fine
stupid
wretches
no
sooner
i
thought
the
dango
incident
closed
than
the
red
towel
became
the
topic
for
widespread
gossip
inquiry
as
to
the
story
revealed
it
to
be
something
unusually
absurd
since
my
arrival
here
i
had
made
it
a
part
of
my
routine
to
take
in
the
hot
springs
bath
every
day
while
there
was
nothing
in
this
town
which
compared
favorably
with
tokyo
the
hot
springs
were
worthy
of
praise
so
long
as
i
was
in
the
town
i
decided
that
i
would
have
a
dip
every
day
and
went
there
walking
partly
for
physical
exercise
before
my
supper
and
whenever
i
went
there
i
used
to
carry
a
large
size
european
towel
dangling
from
my
hand
added
to
somewhat
reddish
color
the
towel
had
acquired
by
its
having
been
soaked
in
the
hot
springs
the
red
color
on
its
border
which
was
not
fast
enough
streaked
about
so
that
the
towel
now
looked
as
if
it
were
dyed
red
this
towel
hung
down
from
my
hand
on
both
ways
whether
afoot
or
riding
in
the
train
for
this
reason
the
students
nicknamed
me
red
towel
honest
it
is
exasperating
to
live
in
a
little
town
there
is
some
more
the
bath
house
i
patronized
was
a
newly
built
three
story
house
and
for
the
patrons
of
the
first
class
the
house
provided
a
bath
robe
in
addition
to
an
attendant
and
the
cost
was
only
eight
sen
on
top
of
that
a
maid
would
serve
tea
in
a
regular
polite
fashion
i
always
paid
the
first
class
then
those
gossipy
spotters
started
saying
that
for
one
who
made
only
forty
yen
a
month
to
take
a
first
class
bath
every
day
was
extravagant
why
the
devil
should
they
care
it
was
none
of
their
business
there
is
still
some
more
the
bath
tub
or
the
tank
in
this
case
was
built
of
granite
and
measured
about
thirty
square
feet
usually
there
were
thirteen
or
fourteen
people
in
the
tank
but
sometimes
there
was
none
as
the
water
came
up
clear
to
the
breast
i
enjoyed
for
athletic
purposes
swimming
in
the
tank
i
delighted
in
swimming
in
this
30
square
feet
tank
taking
chances
of
the
total
absence
of
other
people
once
going
downstairs
from
the
third
story
with
a
light
heart
and
peeping
through
the
entrance
of
the
tank
to
see
if
i
should
be
able
to
swim
i
noticed
a
sign
put
up
in
which
was
boldly
written
no
swimming
allowed
in
the
tank
as
there
may
not
have
been
many
who
swam
in
the
tank
this
notice
was
probably
put
up
particularly
for
my
sake
after
that
i
gave
up
swimming
but
although
i
gave
up
swimming
i
was
surprised
when
i
went
to
the
school
to
see
on
the
board
as
usual
written
no
swimming
allowed
in
the
tank
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
students
united
in
tracking
me
everywhere
they
made
me
sick
i
was
not
a
fellow
to
stop
doing
whatever
i
had
started
upon
no
matter
what
students
might
say
but
i
became
thoroughly
disgusted
when
i
meditated
on
why
i
had
come
to
such
a
narrow
suffocating
place
and
then
when
i
returned
home
the
antique
curio
siege
was
still
going
on
chapter
iv
for
us
teachers
there
was
a
duty
of
night
watch
in
the
school
and
we
had
to
do
it
in
turn
but
badger
and
red
shirt
were
not
in
it
on
asking
why
these
two
were
exempt
from
this
duty
i
was
told
that
they
were
accorded
by
the
government
treatment
similar
to
officials
of
sonin
rank
oh
fudge
they
were
paid
more
worked
less
and
were
then
excused
from
this
night
watch
it
was
not
fair
they
made
regulations
to
suit
their
convenience
and
seemed
to
regard
all
this
as
a
matter
of
course
how
could
they
be
so
brazen
faced
as
this
i
was
greatly
dissatisfied
relative
to
this
question
but
according
to
the
opinion
of
porcupine
protests
by
a
single
person
with
what
insistency
they
may
be
made
will
not
be
heard
they
ought
to
be
heard
whether
they
are
made
by
one
person
or
by
two
if
they
are
just
porcupine
remonstrated
with
me
by
quoting
might
is
right
in
english
i
did
not
catch
his
point
so
i
asked
him
again
and
he
told
me
that
it
meant
the
right
of
the
stronger
if
it
was
the
right
of
the
stronger
i
had
known
it
for
long
and
did
not
require
porcupine
explain
that
to
me
at
this
time
the
right
of
the
stronger
was
a
question
different
from
that
of
the
night
watch
who
would
agree
that
badger
and
red
shirt
were
the
stronger
but
argument
or
no
argument
the
turn
of
this
night
watch
at
last
fell
upon
me
being
quite
fastidious
i
never
enjoyed
sound
sleep
unless
i
slept
comfortably
in
my
own
bedding
from
my
childhood
i
never
stayed
out
overnight
when
i
did
not
find
sleeping
under
the
roof
of
my
friends
inviting
night
watch
in
the
school
you
may
be
sure
was
still
worse
however
repulsive
if
this
was
a
part
of
the
forty
yen
a
month
there
was
no
alternative
i
had
to
do
it
to
remain
alone
in
the
school
after
the
faculty
and
students
had
gone
home
was
something
particularly
awkward
the
room
for
the
night
watch
was
in
the
rear
of
the
school
building
at
the
west
end
of
the
dormitory
i
stepped
inside
to
see
how
it
was
and
finding
it
squarely
facing
the
setting
sun
i
thought
i
would
melt
in
spite
of
autumn
having
already
set
in
the
hot
spell
still
lingered
quite
in
keeping
with
the
dilly
dally
atmosphere
of
the
country
i
ordered
the
same
kind
of
meal
as
served
for
the
students
and
finished
my
supper
the
meal
was
unspeakably
poor
it
was
a
wonder
they
could
subsist
on
such
miserable
stuff
and
keep
on
roughing
it
in
that
lively
fashion
not
only
that
they
were
always
hungry
for
supper
finishing
it
at
4
30
in
the
afternoon
they
must
be
heroes
in
a
sense
i
had
thus
my
supper
but
the
sun
being
still
high
could
not
go
to
bed
yet
i
felt
like
going
to
the
hot
springs
i
did
not
know
the
wrong
or
right
of
night
watch
going
out
but
it
was
oppressively
trying
to
stand
a
life
akin
to
heavy
imprisonment
when
i
called
at
the
school
the
first
time
and
inquired
about
night
watch
i
was
told
by
the
janitor
that
he
had
just
gone
out
and
i
thought
it
strange
but
now
by
taking
the
turn
of
night
watch
myself
i
could
fathom
the
situation
it
was
right
for
any
night
watch
to
go
out
i
told
the
janitor
that
i
was
going
out
for
a
minute
he
asked
me
on
business
and
i
answered
no
but
to
take
a
bath
at
the
hot
springs
and
went
out
straight
it
was
too
bad
that
i
had
left
my
red
towel
at
home
but
i
would
borrow
one
over
there
for
to
day
i
took
plenty
of
time
in
dipping
in
the
bath
and
as
it
became
dark
at
last
i
came
to
the
furumachi
station
on
a
train
it
was
only
about
four
blocks
to
the
school
i
could
cover
it
in
no
time
when
i
started
walking
schoolwards
badger
was
seen
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
badger
i
presumed
was
going
to
the
hot
springs
by
this
train
he
came
with
brisk
steps
and
as
we
passed
by
i
nodded
my
courtesy
then
badger
with
a
studiously
owlish
countenance
asked
am
i
wrong
to
understand
that
you
are
night
watch
chuck
that
am
i
wrong
to
understand
two
hours
ago
did
he
not
say
to
me
you
re
on
first
night
watch
to
night
now
take
care
of
yourself
what
makes
one
use
such
a
roundabout
twisted
way
of
saying
anything
when
he
becomes
a
principal
i
was
far
from
smiling
yes
sir
i
said
i
m
night
watch
to
night
and
as
i
am
night
watch
i
will
return
to
the
school
and
stay
there
overnight
sure
with
this
parting
shot
i
left
him
where
we
met
coming
then
to
the
cross
streets
of
katamachi
i
met
porcupine
this
is
a
narrow
place
i
tell
you
whenever
one
ventures
out
he
is
sure
to
come
across
some
familiar
face
say
aren
t
you
night
watch
he
hallooed
and
i
said
yes
i
am
tis
wrong
for
night
watch
to
leave
his
post
at
his
pleasure
he
added
and
to
this
i
blurted
out
with
a
bold
front
nothing
wrong
at
all
it
is
wrong
not
to
go
out
say
old
man
your
slap
dash
is
going
to
the
limit
wouldn
t
look
well
for
the
principal
or
the
head
teacher
to
see
you
out
like
this
the
submissive
tone
of
his
remark
was
contrary
to
porcupine
as
i
had
known
him
so
far
so
i
cut
him
short
by
saying
i
have
met
the
principal
just
now
why
he
approved
my
taking
a
stroll
about
the
town
said
it
would
be
hard
on
night
watch
unless
he
took
a
walk
when
it
is
hot
then
i
made
a
bee
line
for
the
school
soon
it
was
night
i
called
the
janitor
to
my
room
and
had
a
chat
for
about
two
hours
i
grew
tired
of
this
and
thought
i
would
get
into
bed
anyway
even
if
i
could
not
sleep
i
put
on
my
night
shirt
lifted
the
mosquito
net
rolled
off
the
red
blanket
and
fell
down
flat
on
my
back
with
a
bang
the
making
of
this
bumping
noise
when
i
go
to
bed
is
my
habit
from
my
boyhood
it
is
a
bad
habit
once
declared
a
student
of
a
law
school
who
lived
on
the
ground
floor
and
i
on
the
second
when
i
was
in
the
boarding
house
at
ogawa
machi
kanda
ku
and
who
brought
complaints
to
my
room
in
person
students
of
law
schools
weaklings
as
they
are
have
double
the
ability
of
ordinary
persons
when
it
comes
to
talking
as
this
student
of
law
dwelt
long
on
absurd
accusations
i
downed
him
by
answering
that
the
noise
made
when
i
went
to
bed
was
not
the
fault
of
my
hip
but
that
of
the
house
which
was
not
built
on
a
solid
base
and
that
if
he
had
any
fuss
to
make
make
it
to
the
house
not
to
me
this
room
for
night
watch
was
not
on
the
second
floor
so
nobody
cared
how
much
i
banged
i
do
not
feel
well
rested
unless
i
go
to
bed
with
the
loudest
bang
i
can
make
this
is
bully
and
i
straightened
out
my
feet
when
something
jumped
and
clung
to
them
they
felt
coarse
and
seemed
not
to
be
fleas
i
was
a
bit
surprised
and
shook
my
feet
inside
the
blanket
two
or
three
times
instantly
the
blamed
thing
increased
five
or
six
of
them
on
my
legs
two
or
three
on
the
thighs
one
crushed
beneath
my
hip
and
another
clear
up
to
my
belly
the
shock
became
greater
up
i
jumped
took
off
the
blanket
and
about
fifty
to
sixty
grasshoppers
flew
out
i
was
more
or
less
uneasy
until
i
found
out
what
they
were
but
now
i
saw
they
were
grasshoppers
they
set
me
on
the
war
path
you
insignificant
grasshoppers
startling
a
man
see
what
s
coming
to
you
with
this
i
slapped
them
with
my
pillow
twice
or
thrice
but
the
objects
being
so
small
the
effect
was
out
of
proportion
to
the
force
with
which
the
blows
were
administered
i
adopted
a
different
plan
in
the
manner
of
beating
floor
mats
with
rolled
matting
at
house
cleaning
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
began
beating
them
with
the
pillow
many
of
them
flew
up
by
the
force
of
the
pillow
some
desperately
clung
on
or
shot
against
my
nose
or
head
i
could
not
very
well
hit
those
on
my
head
with
the
pillow
i
grabbed
such
and
dashed
them
on
the
floor
what
was
more
provoking
was
that
no
matter
how
hard
i
dashed
them
they
landed
on
the
mosquito
net
where
they
made
a
fluffy
jerk
and
remained
far
from
being
dead
at
last
in
about
half
an
hour
the
slaughter
of
the
grasshoppers
was
ended
i
fetched
a
broom
and
swept
them
out
the
janitor
came
along
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
damn
the
matter
where
in
thunder
are
the
fools
who
keep
grasshoppers
in
bed
you
pumpkinhead
the
janitor
answered
by
explaining
that
he
did
not
know
anything
about
it
you
can
t
get
away
with
did
not
know
and
i
followed
this
thundering
by
throwing
away
the
broom
the
awe
struck
janitor
shouldered
the
broom
and
faded
away
at
once
i
summoned
three
of
the
students
to
my
room
as
the
representatives
and
six
of
them
reported
six
or
ten
made
no
difference
i
rolled
up
the
sleeves
of
my
night
shirt
and
fired
away
what
do
you
mean
by
putting
grasshoppers
in
my
bed
grasshoppers
what
are
they
said
one
in
front
in
a
tone
disgustingly
quiet
in
this
school
not
only
the
principal
but
the
students
as
well
were
addicted
to
using
twisted
round
expressions
don
t
know
grasshoppers
you
shall
see
to
my
chagrin
there
was
none
i
had
swept
them
all
out
i
called
the
janitor
again
and
told
him
to
fetch
those
grasshoppers
he
had
taken
away
the
janitor
said
he
had
thrown
them
into
the
garbage
box
but
that
he
would
pick
them
out
again
yes
hurry
up
i
said
and
he
sped
away
after
a
while
he
brought
back
about
ten
grasshoppers
on
a
white
paper
remarking
i
m
sorry
sir
it
s
dark
outside
and
i
can
t
find
out
more
i
ll
find
some
tomorrow
all
fools
here
down
to
the
janitor
i
showed
one
grasshopper
to
the
students
this
is
a
grasshopper
what
s
the
matter
for
as
big
idiots
as
you
not
to
know
a
grasshopper
then
the
one
with
a
round
face
sitting
on
the
left
saucily
shot
back
a
ah
say
that
s
a
locust
a
ah
shut
up
they
re
the
same
thing
in
the
first
place
what
do
you
mean
by
answering
your
teacher
a
ah
say
ah
say
or
ah
sing
is
a
chink
s
name
for
this
counter
shot
he
answered
a
ah
say
and
ah
sing
is
different
a
ah
say
they
never
got
rid
of
a
ah
say
grasshoppers
or
locusts
why
did
you
put
them
into
my
bed
when
i
asked
you
to
nobody
put
them
in
if
not
how
could
they
get
into
the
bed
locusts
are
fond
of
warm
places
and
probably
they
got
in
there
respectfully
by
themselves
you
fools
grasshoppers
getting
into
bed
respectfully
i
should
smile
at
them
getting
in
there
respectfully
now
what
s
the
reason
for
doing
this
mischief
speak
out
but
there
is
no
way
to
explain
it
because
we
didn
t
do
it
shrimps
if
they
were
afraid
of
making
a
clean
breast
of
their
own
deed
they
should
not
have
done
it
at
all
they
looked
defiant
and
appeared
to
insist
on
their
innocence
as
long
as
no
evidence
was
brought
up
i
myself
did
some
mischief
while
in
the
middle
school
but
when
the
culprit
was
sought
after
i
was
never
so
cowardly
not
even
once
to
back
out
what
one
has
done
has
been
done
what
he
has
not
has
not
been
that
s
the
black
and
white
of
it
i
for
one
have
been
game
and
square
no
matter
how
much
mischief
i
might
have
done
if
i
wished
to
dodge
the
punishment
i
would
not
start
it
mischief
and
punishment
are
bound
to
go
together
we
can
enjoy
mischief
making
with
some
show
of
spirit
because
it
is
accompanied
by
certain
consequences
where
does
one
expect
to
see
the
dastardly
spirit
which
hungers
for
mischief
making
without
punishment
in
vogue
the
fellows
who
like
to
borrow
money
but
not
pay
it
back
are
surely
such
as
these
students
here
after
they
are
graduated
what
did
these
fellows
come
to
this
middle
school
for
anyway
they
enter
a
school
tattle
round
lies
play
silly
jokes
behind
some
one
by
sneaking
and
cheating
and
get
wrongly
swell
headed
when
they
finish
the
school
thinking
they
have
received
an
education
a
common
lot
of
jackasses
they
are
my
hatred
of
talking
with
these
scamps
became
intense
so
i
dismissed
them
by
saying
if
you
fellows
have
nothing
to
say
let
it
go
at
that
you
deserve
pity
for
not
knowing
the
decent
from
the
vulgar
after
coming
to
a
middle
school
i
am
not
very
decent
in
my
own
language
or
manner
but
am
sure
that
my
moral
standard
is
far
more
decent
than
that
of
these
gangs
those
six
boys
filed
out
leisurely
outwardly
they
appeared
more
dignified
than
i
their
teacher
it
was
the
more
repulsive
for
their
calm
behavior
i
have
no
temerity
equal
to
theirs
then
i
went
to
bed
again
and
found
the
inside
of
the
net
full
of
merry
crowds
of
mosquitoes
i
could
not
bother
myself
to
burn
one
by
one
with
a
candle
flame
so
i
took
the
net
off
the
hooks
folded
it
the
lengthwise
and
shook
it
crossways
up
and
down
the
room
one
of
the
rings
of
the
net
flying
round
accidentally
hit
the
back
of
my
hand
the
effect
of
which
i
did
not
soon
forget
when
i
went
to
bed
for
the
third
time
i
cooled
off
a
little
but
could
not
sleep
easily
my
watch
showed
it
was
half
past
ten
well
as
i
thought
it
over
i
realized
myself
as
having
come
to
a
dirty
pit
if
all
teachers
of
middle
schools
everywhere
have
to
handle
fellows
like
these
in
this
school
those
teachers
have
my
sympathy
it
is
wonderful
that
teachers
never
run
short
i
believe
there
are
many
boneheads
of
extraordinary
patience
but
me
for
something
else
in
this
respect
kiyo
is
worthy
of
admiration
she
is
an
old
woman
with
neither
education
nor
social
position
but
as
a
human
she
does
more
to
command
our
respect
until
now
i
have
been
a
trouble
to
her
without
appreciating
her
goodness
but
having
come
alone
to
such
a
far
off
country
i
now
appreciated
for
the
first
time
her
kindness
if
she
is
fond
of
sasa
ame
of
echigo
province
and
if
i
go
to
echigo
for
the
purpose
of
buying
that
sweetmeat
to
let
her
eat
it
she
is
fully
worth
that
trouble
kiyo
has
been
praising
me
as
unselfish
and
straight
but
she
is
a
person
of
sterling
qualities
far
more
than
i
whom
she
praises
i
began
to
feel
like
meeting
her
while
i
was
thus
meditating
about
kiyo
all
of
a
sudden
on
the
floor
above
my
head
about
thirty
to
forty
people
if
i
guess
by
the
number
started
stamping
the
floor
with
bang
bang
bang
that
well
threatened
to
bang
down
the
floor
this
was
followed
by
proportionately
loud
whoops
the
noise
surprised
me
and
i
popped
up
the
moment
i
got
up
i
became
aware
that
the
students
were
starting
a
rough
house
to
get
even
with
me
what
wrong
one
has
committed
he
has
to
confess
or
his
offence
is
never
atoned
for
they
are
just
to
ask
for
themselves
what
crimes
they
have
done
it
should
be
proper
that
they
repent
their
folly
after
going
to
bed
and
to
come
and
beg
me
pardon
the
next
morning
even
if
they
could
not
go
so
far
as
to
apologize
they
should
have
kept
quiet
then
what
does
this
racket
mean
where
we
keeping
hogs
in
our
dormitory
this
crazy
thing
got
to
stop
see
what
you
get
i
ran
out
of
the
room
in
my
night
shirt
and
flew
upstairs
in
three
and
half
steps
then
strange
to
say
thunderous
rumbling
of
which
i
was
sure
of
hearing
in
the
act
was
hushed
not
only
a
whisper
but
even
footsteps
were
not
heard
this
was
funny
the
lamp
was
already
blown
out
and
although
i
could
not
see
what
was
what
in
the
dark
nevertheless
could
tell
by
instinct
whether
there
was
somebody
around
or
not
in
the
long
corridor
running
from
the
east
to
the
west
there
was
not
hiding
even
a
mouse
from
other
end
of
the
corridor
the
moonlight
flooded
in
and
about
there
it
was
particularly
light
the
scene
was
somewhat
uncanny
i
have
had
the
habit
from
my
boyhood
of
frequently
dreaming
and
of
flying
out
of
bed
and
of
muttering
things
which
nobody
understood
affording
everybody
a
hearty
laugh
one
night
when
i
was
sixteen
or
seventeen
i
dreamed
that
i
picked
up
a
diamond
and
getting
up
demanded
of
my
brother
who
was
sleeping
close
to
me
what
he
had
done
with
that
diamond
the
demand
was
made
with
such
force
that
for
about
three
days
all
in
the
house
chaffed
me
about
the
fatal
loss
of
precious
stone
much
to
my
humiliation
maybe
this
noise
which
i
heard
was
but
a
dream
although
i
was
sure
it
was
real
i
was
wondering
thus
in
the
middle
of
the
corridor
when
at
the
further
end
where
it
was
moonlit
a
roar
was
raised
coming
from
about
thirty
or
forty
throats
one
two
three
whee
ee
the
roar
had
hardly
subsided
when
as
before
the
stamping
of
the
floor
commenced
with
furious
rhythm
ah
it
was
not
a
dream
but
a
real
thing
quit
making
the
noise
tis
midnight
i
shouted
to
beat
the
band
and
started
in
their
direction
my
passage
was
dark
the
moonlight
yonder
was
only
my
guide
about
twelve
feet
past
i
stumbled
squarely
against
some
hard
object
ere
the
ouch
has
passed
clear
up
to
my
head
i
was
thrown
down
i
called
all
kinds
of
gods
but
could
not
run
my
mind
urged
me
on
to
hurry
up
but
my
leg
would
not
obey
the
command
growing
impatient
i
hobbled
on
one
foot
and
found
both
voice
and
stamping
already
ceased
and
perfectly
quiet
men
can
be
cowards
but
i
never
expected
them
capable
of
becoming
such
dastardly
cowards
as
this
they
challenged
hogs
now
the
situation
having
developed
to
this
pretty
mess
i
would
not
give
it
up
until
i
had
dragged
them
out
from
hiding
and
forced
them
to
apologize
with
this
determination
i
tried
to
open
one
of
the
doors
and
examine
inside
but
it
would
not
open
it
was
locked
or
held
fast
with
a
pile
of
tables
or
something
to
my
persistent
efforts
the
door
stood
unyielding
then
i
tried
one
across
the
corridor
on
the
northside
but
it
was
also
locked
while
this
irritating
attempt
at
door
opening
was
going
on
again
on
the
east
end
of
the
corridor
the
whooping
roar
and
rhythmic
stamping
of
feet
were
heard
the
fools
at
both
ends
were
bent
on
making
a
goose
of
me
i
realized
this
but
then
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
i
frankly
confess
that
i
have
not
quite
as
much
tact
as
dashing
spirit
in
such
a
case
i
am
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
swaying
circumstances
without
my
own
way
of
getting
through
it
nevertheless
i
do
not
expect
to
play
the
part
of
underdog
if
i
dropped
the
affair
then
and
there
it
would
reflect
upon
my
dignity
it
would
be
mortifying
to
have
them
think
that
they
had
one
on
the
tokyo
kid
and
that
tokyo
kid
was
wanting
in
tenacity
to
have
it
on
record
that
i
had
been
guyed
by
these
insignificant
spawn
when
on
night
watch
and
had
to
give
in
to
their
impudence
because
i
could
not
handle
them
this
would
be
an
indelible
disgrace
on
my
life
mark
ye
i
am
descendant
of
a
samurai
of
the
hatamato
class
the
blood
of
the
hatamoto
samurai
could
be
traced
to
mitsunaka
tada
who
in
turn
could
claim
still
a
nobler
ancestor
i
am
different
from
and
nobler
than
these
manure
smelling
louts
the
only
pity
is
that
i
am
rather
short
of
tact
that
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
in
such
a
case
that
is
the
trouble
but
i
would
not
throw
up
the
sponge
not
on
your
life
i
only
do
not
know
how
because
i
am
honest
just
think
if
the
honest
does
not
win
what
else
is
there
in
this
world
that
will
win
if
i
cannot
beat
them
to
night
i
will
tomorrow
if
not
tomorrow
then
the
day
after
tomorrow
if
not
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
will
sit
down
right
here
get
my
meals
from
my
home
until
i
beat
them
thus
resolved
i
squatted
in
the
middle
of
the
corridor
and
waited
for
the
dawn
myriads
of
mosquitoes
swarmed
about
me
but
i
did
not
mind
them
i
felt
my
leg
where
i
hit
it
a
while
ago
it
seemed
bespattered
with
something
greasy
i
thought
it
was
bleeding
let
it
bleed
all
it
cares
meanwhile
exhausted
by
these
unwonted
affairs
i
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
up
i
jumped
with
a
curse
the
door
on
my
right
was
half
opened
and
two
students
were
standing
in
front
of
me
the
moment
i
recovered
my
senses
from
the
drowsy
lull
i
grabbed
a
leg
of
one
of
them
nearest
to
me
and
yanked
it
with
all
my
might
he
fell
down
prone
look
at
what
you
re
getting
now
i
flew
at
the
other
fellow
who
was
much
confused
gave
him
vigorous
shaking
twice
or
thrice
and
he
only
kept
open
his
bewildering
eyes
come
up
to
my
room
evidently
they
were
mollycoddles
for
they
obeyed
my
command
without
a
murmur
the
day
had
become
already
clear
i
began
questioning
those
two
in
my
room
but
you
cannot
pound
out
the
leopard
s
spots
no
matter
how
you
may
try
they
seemed
determined
to
push
it
through
by
an
insistent
declaration
of
not
guilty
that
they
would
not
confess
while
this
questioning
was
going
on
the
students
upstairs
came
down
one
by
one
and
began
congregating
in
my
room
i
noticed
all
their
eyes
were
swollen
from
want
of
sleep
blooming
nice
faces
you
got
for
not
sleeping
only
one
night
and
you
call
yourselves
men
go
wash
your
face
and
come
back
to
hear
what
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
i
hurled
this
shot
at
them
but
none
of
them
went
to
wash
his
face
for
about
one
hour
i
had
been
talking
and
back
talking
with
about
fifty
students
when
suddenly
badger
put
in
his
appearance
i
heard
afterward
that
the
janitor
ran
to
badger
for
the
purpose
of
reporting
to
him
that
there
was
a
trouble
in
the
school
what
a
weak
knee
of
the
janitor
to
fetch
the
principal
for
so
trifling
an
affair
as
this
no
wonder
he
cannot
see
better
times
than
a
janitor
the
principal
listened
to
my
explanation
and
also
to
brief
remarks
from
the
students
attend
school
as
usual
till
further
notice
hurry
up
with
washing
your
face
and
breakfast
there
isn
t
much
time
left
so
the
principal
let
go
all
the
students
decidedly
slow
way
of
handling
this
if
i
were
the
principal
i
would
expel
them
right
away
it
is
because
the
school
accords
them
such
luke
warm
treatment
that
they
get
fresh
and
start
guying
the
night
watch
he
said
to
me
that
it
must
have
been
trying
on
my
nerves
and
that
i
might
be
tired
and
also
that
i
need
not
teach
that
day
to
this
i
replied
no
sir
no
worrying
at
all
such
things
may
happen
every
night
but
it
would
not
disturb
me
in
the
least
as
long
as
i
breathe
i
will
do
the
teaching
if
i
were
not
able
to
teach
on
account
of
lack
of
sleep
for
only
one
single
night
i
would
make
a
rebate
of
my
salary
to
the
school
i
do
not
know
how
this
impressed
him
but
he
gazed
at
me
for
a
while
and
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
my
face
was
rather
swollen
indeed
i
felt
it
heavy
besides
it
itched
all
over
i
was
sure
the
mosquitoes
must
have
stung
me
there
to
their
hearts
content
i
further
added
my
face
may
be
swollen
but
i
can
talk
all
right
so
i
will
teach
thus
scratching
my
face
with
some
warmth
the
principal
smiled
and
remarked
well
you
have
the
strength
to
tell
the
truth
he
did
not
intend
remark
to
be
a
compliment
but
i
think
a
sneer
chapter
v
won
t
you
go
fishing
asked
red
shirt
he
talks
in
a
strangely
womanish
voice
one
would
not
be
able
to
tell
whether
he
was
a
man
or
a
woman
as
a
man
he
should
talk
like
one
is
he
not
a
college
graduate
i
can
talk
man
like
enough
and
am
a
graduate
from
a
school
of
physics
at
that
it
is
a
shame
for
a
b
a
to
have
such
a
squeak
i
answered
with
the
smallest
enthusiasm
whereupon
he
further
asked
me
an
impolite
question
if
i
ever
did
fishing
i
told
him
not
much
that
i
once
caught
three
gibels
when
i
was
a
boy
at
a
fishing
game
pond
at
koume
and
that
i
also
caught
a
carp
about
eight
inches
long
at
a
similar
game
at
the
festival
of
bishamon
at
kagurazaka
the
carp
just
as
i
was
coaxing
it
out
of
the
water
splashed
back
into
it
and
when
i
think
of
the
incident
i
feel
mortified
at
the
loss
even
now
red
shirt
stuck
out
his
chin
and
laughed
ho
ho
why
could
he
not
laugh
just
like
an
ordinary
person
then
you
are
not
well
acquainted
with
the
spirit
of
the
game
he
cried
i
ll
show
you
if
you
like
he
seemed
highly
elated
not
for
me
i
take
it
this
way
that
generally
those
who
are
fond
of
fishing
or
shooting
have
cruel
hearts
otherwise
there
is
no
reason
why
they
could
derive
pleasure
in
murdering
innocent
creatures
surely
fish
and
birds
would
prefer
living
to
getting
killed
except
those
who
make
fishing
or
shooting
their
calling
it
is
nonsense
for
those
who
are
well
off
to
say
that
they
cannot
sleep
well
unless
they
seek
the
lives
of
fish
or
birds
this
was
the
way
i
looked
at
the
question
but
as
he
was
a
b
a
and
would
have
a
better
command
of
language
when
it
came
to
talking
i
kept
mum
knowing
he
would
beat
me
in
argument
red
shirt
mistook
my
silence
for
my
surrender
and
began
to
induce
me
to
join
him
right
away
saying
he
would
show
me
some
fish
and
i
should
come
with
him
if
i
was
not
busy
because
he
and
mr
yoshikawa
were
lonesome
when
alone
mr
yoshikawa
is
the
teacher
of
drawing
whom
i
had
nicknamed
clown
i
don
t
know
what
s
in
the
mind
of
this
clown
but
he
was
a
constant
visitor
at
the
house
of
red
shirt
and
wherever
he
went
clown
was
sure
to
be
trailing
after
him
they
appeared
more
like
master
and
servant
than
two
fellow
teachers
as
clown
used
to
follow
red
shirt
like
a
shadow
it
would
be
natural
to
see
them
go
off
together
now
but
when
those
two
alone
would
have
been
well
off
why
should
they
invite
me
this
brusque
unaesthetic
fellow
was
hard
to
understand
probably
vain
of
his
fishing
ability
he
desired
to
show
his
skill
but
he
aimed
at
the
wrong
mark
if
that
was
his
intention
as
nothing
of
the
kind
would
touch
me
i
would
not
be
chagrined
if
he
fishes
out
two
or
three
tunnies
i
am
a
man
myself
and
poor
though
i
may
be
in
the
art
i
would
hook
something
if
i
dropped
a
line
if
i
declined
his
invitation
red
shirt
would
suspect
that
i
refused
not
because
of
my
lack
of
interest
in
the
game
but
because
of
my
want
of
skill
of
fishing
i
weighed
the
matter
thus
and
accepted
his
invitation
after
the
school
i
returned
home
and
got
ready
and
having
joined
red
shirt
and
clown
at
the
station
we
three
started
to
the
shore
there
was
only
one
boatman
to
row
the
boat
was
long
and
narrow
a
kind
we
do
not
have
in
tokyo
i
looked
for
fishing
rods
but
could
find
none
how
can
we
fish
without
rods
how
are
we
going
to
manage
it
i
asked
clown
and
he
told
me
with
the
air
of
a
professional
fisherman
that
no
rods
were
needed
in
the
deep
sea
fishing
but
only
lines
i
had
better
not
asked
him
if
i
was
to
be
talked
down
in
this
way
the
boatman
was
rowing
very
slowly
but
his
skill
was
something
wonderful
we
had
already
come
far
out
to
sea
and
on
turning
back
saw
the
shore
minimized
fading
in
far
distance
the
five
storied
pagoda
of
tosho
temple
appeared
above
the
surrounding
woods
like
a
needle
point
yonder
stood
aoshima
blue
island
nobody
was
living
on
this
island
which
a
closer
view
showed
to
be
covered
with
stones
and
pine
trees
no
wonder
no
one
could
live
there
red
shirt
was
intently
surveying
about
and
praising
the
general
view
as
fine
clown
also
termed
it
an
absolutely
fine
view
i
don
t
know
whether
it
is
so
fine
as
to
be
absolute
but
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
exhilarating
air
i
realized
it
as
the
best
tonic
to
be
thus
blown
by
the
fresh
sea
breeze
upon
a
wide
expanse
of
water
i
felt
hungry
look
at
that
pine
its
trunk
is
straight
and
spreads
its
top
branches
like
an
umbrella
isn
t
it
a
turnersque
picture
said
red
shirt
yes
just
like
turner
s
responded
clown
isn
t
the
way
it
curves
just
elegant
exactly
the
touch
of
turner
he
added
with
some
show
of
pride
i
didn
t
know
what
turner
was
but
as
i
could
get
along
without
knowing
it
i
kept
silent
the
boat
turned
to
the
left
with
the
island
on
the
right
the
sea
was
so
perfectly
calm
as
to
tempt
one
to
think
he
was
not
on
the
deep
sea
the
pleasant
occasion
was
a
credit
to
red
shirt
as
i
wished
if
possible
to
land
on
the
island
i
asked
the
boatman
if
our
boat
could
not
be
made
to
it
upon
this
red
shirt
objected
saying
that
we
could
do
so
but
it
was
not
advisable
to
go
too
close
the
shore
for
fishing
i
kept
still
for
a
while
then
clown
made
the
unlooked
for
proposal
that
the
island
be
named
turner
island
that
s
good
we
shall
call
it
so
hereafter
seconded
red
shirt
if
i
was
included
in
that
we
it
was
something
i
least
cared
for
aoshima
was
good
enough
for
me
by
the
way
how
would
it
look
said
clown
if
we
place
madonna
by
raphael
upon
that
rock
it
would
make
a
fine
picture
let
s
quit
talking
about
madonna
ho
ho
ho
and
red
shirt
emitted
a
spooky
laugh
that
s
all
right
nobody
s
around
remarked
clown
as
he
glanced
at
me
and
turning
his
face
to
other
direction
significantly
smiled
devilishly
i
felt
sickened
as
it
was
none
of
my
business
whether
it
was
a
madonna
or
a
kodanna
young
master
they
let
pose
there
any
old
way
but
it
was
vulgar
to
feign
assurance
that
one
s
subject
is
in
no
danger
of
being
understood
so
long
as
others
did
not
know
the
subject
clown
claims
himself
as
a
yedo
kid
i
thought
that
the
person
called
madonna
was
no
other
than
a
favorite
geisha
of
red
shirt
i
should
smile
at
the
idea
of
his
gazing
at
his
tootsy
wootsy
standing
beneath
a
pine
tree
it
would
be
better
if
clown
would
make
an
oil
painting
of
the
scene
and
exhibit
it
for
the
public
this
will
be
about
the
best
place
so
saying
the
boatman
stopped
rowing
the
boat
and
dropped
an
anchor
how
deep
is
it
asked
red
shirt
and
was
told
about
six
fathoms
hard
to
fish
sea
breams
in
six
fathoms
said
red
shirt
as
he
dropped
a
line
into
the
water
the
old
sport
appeared
to
expect
to
fetch
some
bream
bravo
it
wouldn
t
be
hard
for
you
besides
it
is
calm
clown
fawningly
remarked
and
he
too
dropped
a
line
the
line
had
only
a
tiny
bit
of
lead
that
looked
like
a
weight
it
had
no
float
to
fish
without
a
float
seemed
as
nearly
reasonable
as
to
measure
the
heat
without
a
thermometer
which
was
something
impossible
for
me
so
i
looked
on
they
then
told
me
to
start
and
asked
me
if
i
had
any
line
i
told
them
i
had
more
than
i
could
use
but
that
i
had
no
float
to
say
that
one
is
unable
to
fish
without
a
float
shows
that
he
is
a
novice
piped
up
clown
see
when
the
line
touches
the
bottom
you
just
manage
it
with
your
finger
on
the
edge
if
a
fish
bites
you
could
tell
in
a
minute
there
it
goes
and
red
shirt
hastily
started
taking
out
the
line
i
wondered
what
he
had
got
but
i
saw
no
fish
only
the
bait
was
gone
ha
good
for
you
gov
nur
wasn
t
it
too
bad
i
m
sure
it
was
a
big
one
if
you
miss
that
way
with
your
ability
we
would
have
to
keep
a
sharper
watch
to
day
but
say
even
if
we
miss
the
fish
it
s
far
better
than
staring
at
a
float
isn
t
it
just
like
saying
he
can
t
ride
a
bike
without
a
brake
clown
has
been
getting
rather
gay
and
i
was
almost
tempted
to
swat
him
i
m
just
as
good
as
they
are
the
sea
isn
t
leased
by
red
shirt
and
there
might
be
one
obliging
bonito
which
might
get
caught
by
my
line
i
dropped
my
line
then
and
toyed
it
with
my
finger
carelessly
after
a
while
something
shook
my
line
with
successive
jerks
i
thought
it
must
be
a
fish
unless
it
was
something
living
it
would
not
give
that
tremulous
shaking
good
i
have
it
and
i
commenced
drawing
in
the
