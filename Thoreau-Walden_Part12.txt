conclusion
on

duty
of

disobedience
walden
economy
when
i
wrote
the
following
pages
or
rather
the
bulk
of
them
i
lived
alone
in
the
woods
a
mile
from
any
neighbor
in
a
house
which
i
had
built
myself
on
the
shore
of
walden
pond
in
concord
massachusetts
and
earned
my
living
by
the
labor
of
my
hands
only
i
lived
there
two
years
and
two
months
at
present
i
am
a
sojourner
in
civilized
life
again
i
should
not
obtrude
my
affairs
so
much
on
the
notice
of
my
readers
if
very
particular
inquiries
had
not
been
made
by
my
townsmen
concerning
my
mode
of
life
which
some
would
call
impertinent
though
they
do
not
appear
to
me
at
all
impertinent
but
considering
the
circumstances
very
natural
and
pertinent
some
have
asked
what
i
got
to
eat
if
i
did
not
feel
lonesome
if
i
was
not
afraid
and
the
like
others
have
been
curious
to
learn
what
portion
of
my
income
i
devoted
to
charitable
purposes
and
some
who
have
large
families
how
many
poor
children
i
maintained
i
will
therefore
ask
those
of
my
readers
who
feel
no
particular
interest
in
me
to
pardon
me
if
i
undertake
to
answer
some
of
these
questions
in
this
book
in
most
books
the
i
or
first
person
is
omitted
in
this
it
will
be
retained
that
in
respect
to
egotism
is
the
main
difference
we
commonly
do
not
remember
that
it
is
after
all
always
the
first
person
that
is
speaking
i
should
not
talk
so
much
about
myself
if
there
were
anybody
else
whom
i
knew
as
well
unfortunately
i
am
confined
to
this
theme
by
the
narrowness
of
my
experience
moreover
i
on
my
side
require
of
every
writer
first
or
last
a
simple
and
sincere
account
of
his
own
life
and
not
merely
what
he
has
heard
of
other
men
s
lives
some
such
account
as
he
would
send
to
his
kindred
from
a
distant
land
for
if
he
has
lived
sincerely
it
must
have
been
in
a
distant
land
to
me
perhaps
these
pages
are
more
particularly
addressed
to
poor
students
as
for
the
rest
of
my
readers
they
will
accept
such
portions
as
apply
to
them
i
trust
that
none
will
stretch
the
seams
in
putting
on
the
coat
for
it
may
do
good
service
to
him
whom
it
fits
i
would
fain
say
something
not
so
much
concerning
the
chinese
and
sandwich
islanders
as
you
who
read
these
pages
who
are
said
to
live
in
new
england
something
about
your
condition
especially
your
outward
condition
or
circumstances
in
this
world
in
this
town
what
it
is
whether
it
is
necessary
that
it
be
as
bad
as
it
is
whether
it
cannot
be
improved
as
well
as
not
i
have
travelled
a
good
deal
in
concord
and
everywhere
in
shops
and
offices
and
fields
the
inhabitants
have
appeared
to
me
to
be
doing
penance
in
a
thousand
remarkable
ways
what
i
have
heard
of
bramins
sitting
exposed
to
four
fires
and
looking
in
the
face
of
the
sun
or
hanging
suspended
with
their
heads
downward
over
flames
or
looking
at
the
heavens
over
their
shoulders
until
it
becomes
impossible
for
them
to
resume
their
natural
position
while
from
the
twist
of
the
neck
nothing
but
liquids
can
pass
into
the
stomach
or
dwelling
chained
for
life
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
or
measuring
with
their
bodies
like
caterpillars
the
breadth
of
vast
empires
or
standing
on
one
leg
on
the
tops
of
pillars
even
these
forms
of
conscious
penance
are
hardly
more
incredible
and
astonishing
than
the
scenes
which
i
daily
witness
the
twelve
labors
of
hercules
were
trifling
in
comparison
with
those
which
my
neighbors
have
undertaken
for
they
were
only
twelve
and
had
an
end
but
i
could
never
see
that
these
men
slew
or
captured
any
monster
or
finished
any
labor
they
have
no
friend
iolaus
to
burn
with
a
hot
iron
the
root
of
the
hydra
s
head
but
as
soon
as
one
head
is
crushed
two
spring
up
i
see
young
men
my
townsmen
whose
misfortune
it
is
to
have
inherited
farms
houses
barns
cattle
and
farming
tools
for
these
are
more
easily
acquired
than
got
rid
of
better
if
they
had
been
born
in
the
open
pasture
and
suckled
by
a
wolf
that
they
might
have
seen
with
clearer
eyes
what
field
they
were
called
to
labor
in
who
made
them
serfs
of
the
soil
why
should
they
eat
their
sixty
acres
when
man
is
condemned
to
eat
only
his
peck
of
dirt
why
should
they
begin
digging
their
graves
as
soon
as
they
are
born
they
have
got
to
live
a
man
s
life
pushing
all
these
things
before
them
and
get
on
as
well
as
they
can
how
many
a
poor
immortal
soul
have
i
met
well
nigh
crushed
and
smothered
under
its
load
creeping
down
the
road
of
life
pushing
before
it
a
barn
seventy
five
feet
by
forty
its
augean
stables
never
cleansed
and
one
hundred
acres
of
land
tillage
mowing
pasture
and
woodlot
the
portionless
who
struggle
with
no
such
unnecessary
inherited
encumbrances
find
it
labor
enough
to
subdue
and
cultivate
a
few
cubic
feet
of
flesh
but
men
labor
under
a
mistake
the
better
part
of
the
man
is
soon
plowed
into
the
soil
for
compost
by
a
seeming
fate
commonly
called
necessity
they
are
employed
as
it
says
in
an
old
book
laying
up
treasures
which
moth
and
rust
will
corrupt
and
thieves
break
through
and
steal
it
is
a
fool
s
life
as
they
will
find
when
they
get
to
the
end
of
it
if
not
before
it
is
said
that
deucalion
and
pyrrha
created
men
by
throwing
stones
over
their
heads
behind
them
inde
genus
durum
sumus
experiensque
laborum
et
documenta
damus
qua
simus
origine
nati
or
as
raleigh
rhymes
it
in
his
sonorous
way
from
thence
our
kind
hard
hearted
is
enduring
pain
and
care
approving
that
our
bodies
of
a
stony
nature
are
so
much
for
a
blind
obedience
to
a
blundering
oracle
throwing
the
stones
over
their
heads
behind
them
and
not
seeing
where
they
fell
most
men
even
in
this
comparatively
free
country
through
mere
ignorance
and
mistake
are
so
occupied
with
the
factitious
cares
and
superfluously
coarse
labors
of
life
that
its
finer
fruits
cannot
be
plucked
by
them
their
fingers
from
excessive
toil
are
too
clumsy
and
tremble
too
much
for
that
actually
the
laboring
man
has
not
leisure
for
a
true
integrity
day
by
day
he
cannot
afford
to
sustain
the
manliest
relations
to
men
his
labor
would
be
depreciated
in
the
market
he
has
no
time
to
be
anything
but
a
machine
how
can
he
remember
well
his
ignorance
which
his
growth
requires
who
has
so
often
to
use
his
knowledge
we
should
feed
and
clothe
him
gratuitously
sometimes
and
recruit
him
with
our
cordials
before
we
judge
of
him
the
finest
qualities
of
our
nature
like
the
bloom
on
fruits
can
be
preserved
only
by
the
most
delicate
handling
yet
we
do
not
treat
ourselves
nor
one
another
thus
tenderly
some
of
you
we
all
know
are
poor
find
it
hard
to
live
are
sometimes
as
it
were
gasping
for
breath
i
have
no
doubt
that
some
of
you
who
read
this
book
are
unable
to
pay
for
all
the
dinners
which
you
have
actually
eaten
or
for
the
coats
and
shoes
which
are
fast
wearing
or
are
already
worn
out
and
have
come
to
this
page
to
spend
borrowed
or
stolen
time
robbing
your
creditors
of
an
hour
it
is
very
evident
what
mean
and
sneaking
lives
many
of
you
live
for
my
sight
has
been
whetted
by
experience
always
on
the
limits
trying
to
get
into
business
and
trying
to
get
out
of
debt
a
very
ancient
slough
called
by
the
latins
aes
alienum
another
s
brass
for
some
of
their
coins
were
made
of
brass
still
living
and
dying
and
buried
by
this
other
s
brass
always
promising
to
pay
promising
to
pay
tomorrow
and
dying
today
insolvent
seeking
to
curry
favor
to
get
custom
by
how
many
modes
only
not
state
prison
offenses
lying
flattering
voting
contracting
yourselves
into
a
nutshell
of
civility
or
dilating
into
an
atmosphere
of
thin
and
vaporous
generosity
that
you
may
persuade
your
neighbor
to
let
you
make
his
shoes
or
his
hat
or
his
coat
or
his
carriage
or
import
his
groceries
for
him
making
yourselves
sick
that
you
may
lay
up
something
against
a
sick
day
something
to
be
tucked
away
in
an
old
chest
or
in
a
stocking
behind
the
plastering
or
more
safely
in
the
brick
bank
no
matter
where
no
matter
how
much
or
how
little
i
sometimes
wonder
that
we
can
be
so
frivolous
i
may
almost
say
as
to
attend
to
the
gross
but
somewhat
foreign
form
of
servitude
called
negro
slavery
there
are
so
many
keen
and
subtle
masters
that
enslave
both
north
and
south
it
is
hard
to
have
a
southern
overseer
it
is
worse
to
have
a
northern
one
but
worst
of
all
when
you
are
the
slave
driver
of
yourself
talk
of
a
divinity
in
man
look
at
the
teamster
on
the
highway
wending
to
market
by
day
or
night
does
any
divinity
stir
within
him
his
highest
duty
to
fodder
and
water
his
horses
what
is
his
destiny
to
him
compared
with
the
shipping
interests
does
not
he
drive
for
squire
make
a
stir
how
godlike
how
immortal
is
he
see
how
he
cowers
and
sneaks
how
vaguely
all
the
day
he
fears
not
being
immortal
nor
divine
but
the
slave
and
prisoner
of
his
own
opinion
of
himself
a
fame
won
by
his
own
deeds
public
opinion
is
a
weak
tyrant
compared
with
our
own
private
opinion
what
a
man
thinks
of
himself
that
it
is
which
determines
or
rather
indicates
his
fate
self
emancipation
even
in
the
west
indian
provinces
of
the
fancy
and
imagination
what
wilberforce
is
there
to
bring
that
about
think
also
of
the
ladies
of
the
land
weaving
toilet
cushions
against
the
last
day
not
to
betray
too
green
an
interest
in
their
fates
as
if
you
could
kill
time
without
injuring
eternity
the
mass
of
men
lead
lives
of
quiet
desperation
what
is
called
resignation
is
confirmed
desperation
from
the
desperate
city
you
go
into
the
desperate
country
and
have
to
console
yourself
with
the
bravery
of
minks
and
muskrats
a
stereotyped
but
unconscious
despair
is
concealed
even
under
what
are
called
the
games
and
amusements
of
mankind
there
is
no
play
in
them
for
this
comes
after
work
but
it
is
a
characteristic
of
wisdom
not
to
do
desperate
things
when
we
consider
what
to
use
the
words
of
the
catechism
is
the
chief
end
of
man
and
what
are
the
true
necessaries
and
means
of
life
it
appears
as
if
men
had
deliberately
chosen
the
common
mode
of
living
because
they
preferred
it
to
any
other
yet
they
honestly
think
there
is
no
choice
left
but
alert
and
healthy
natures
remember
that
the
sun
rose
clear
it
is
never
too
late
to
give
up
our
prejudices
no
way
of
thinking
or
doing
however
ancient
can
be
trusted
without
proof
what
everybody
echoes
or
in
silence
passes
by
as
true
to
day
may
turn
out
to
be
falsehood
to
morrow
mere
smoke
of
opinion
which
some
had
trusted
for
a
cloud
that
would
sprinkle
fertilizing
rain
on
their
fields
what
old
people
say
you
cannot
do
you
try
and
find
that
you
can
old
deeds
for
old
people
and
new
deeds
for
new
old
people
did
not
know
enough
once
perchance
to
fetch
fresh
fuel
to
keep
the
fire
a
going
new
people
put
a
little
dry
wood
under
a
pot
and
are
whirled
round
the
globe
with
the
speed
of
birds
in
a
way
to
kill
old
people
as
the
phrase
is
age
is
no
better
hardly
so
well
qualified
for
an
instructor
as
youth
for
it
has
not
profited
so
much
as
it
has
lost
one
may
almost
doubt
if
the
wisest
man
has
learned
anything
of
absolute
value
by
living
practically
the
old
have
no
very
important
advice
to
give
the
young
their
own
experience
has
been
so
partial
and
their
lives
have
been
such
miserable
failures
for
private
reasons
as
they
must
believe
and
it
may
be
that
they
have
some
faith
left
which
belies
that
experience
and
they
are
only
less
young
than
they
were
i
have
lived
some
thirty
years
on
this
planet
and
i
have
yet
to
hear
the
first
syllable
of
valuable
or
even
earnest
advice
from
my
seniors
they
have
told
me
nothing
and
probably
cannot
tell
me
anything
to
the
purpose
here
is
life
an
experiment
to
a
great
extent
untried
by
me
but
it
does
not
avail
me
that
they
have
tried
it
if
i
have
any
experience
which
i
think
valuable
i
am
sure
to
reflect
that
this
my
mentors
said
nothing
about
one
farmer
says
to
me
you
cannot
live
on
vegetable
food
solely
for
it
furnishes
nothing
to
make
bones
with
and
so
he
religiously
devotes
a
part
of
his
day
to
supplying
his
system
with
the
raw
material
of
bones
walking
all
the
while
he
talks
behind
his
oxen
which
with
vegetable
made
bones
jerk
him
and
his
lumbering
plow
along
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
some
things
are
really
necessaries
of
life
in
some
circles
the
most
helpless
and
diseased
which
in
others
are
luxuries
merely
and
in
others
still
are
entirely
unknown
the
whole
ground
of
human
life
seems
to
some
to
have
been
gone
over
by
their
predecessors
both
the
heights
and
the
valleys
and
all
things
to
have
been
cared
for
according
to
evelyn
the
wise
solomon
prescribed
ordinances
for
the
very
distances
of
trees
and
the
roman
pr
tors
have
decided
how
often
you
may
go
into
your
neighbor
s
land
to
gather
the
acorns
which
fall
on
it
without
trespass
and
what
share
belongs
to
that
neighbor
hippocrates
has
even
left
directions
how
we
should
cut
our
nails
that
is
even
with
the
ends
of
the
fingers
neither
shorter
nor
longer
undoubtedly
the
very
tedium
and
ennui
which
presume
to
have
exhausted
the
variety
and
the
joys
of
life
are
as
old
as
adam
but
man
s
capacities
have
never
been
measured
nor
are
we
to
judge
of
what
he
can
do
by
any
precedents
so
little
has
been
tried
whatever
have
been
thy
failures
hitherto
be
not
afflicted
my
child
for
who
shall
assign
to
thee
what
thou
hast
left
undone
we
might
try
our
lives
by
a
thousand
simple
tests
as
for
instance
that
the
same
sun
which
ripens
my
beans
illumines
at
once
a
system
of
earths
like
ours
if
i
had
remembered
this
it
would
have
prevented
some
mistakes
this
was
not
the
light
in
which
i
hoed
them
the
stars
are
the
apexes
of
what
wonderful
triangles
what
distant
and
different
beings
in
the
various
mansions
of
the
universe
are
contemplating
the

moment
nature
and
human
life
are
as
various
as
our
several
constitutions
who
shall
say
what
prospect
life
offers
to
another
could
a
greater
miracle
take
place
than
for
us
to
look
through
each
other
s
eyes
for
an
instant
we
should
live
in
all
the
ages
of
the

in
an
hour
ay
in
all
the
worlds
of
the

history

mythology
i
know
of
no
reading
of
another
s
experience
so
startling
and
informing
as
this
would
be
the
greater
part
of
what
my
neighbors
call
good
i
believe
in
my
soul
to
be
bad
and
if
i
repent
of
anything
it
is
very
likely
to
be
my
good
behavior
what
demon
possessed
me
that
i
behaved
so
well
you
may
say
the
wisest
thing
you
can
old
man
you
who
have
lived
seventy
years
not
without
honor
of
a
kind
i
hear
an
irresistible
voice
which
invites
me
away
from
all
that
one
generation
abandons
the
enterprises
of
another
like
stranded
vessels
i
think
that
we
may
safely
trust
a
good
deal
more
than
we
do
we
may
waive
just
so
much
care
of
ourselves
as
we
honestly
bestow
elsewhere
nature
is
as
well
adapted
to
our
weakness
as
to
our
strength
the
incessant
anxiety
and
strain
of
some
is
a
well
nigh
incurable
form
of
disease
we
are
made
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
what
work
we
do
and
yet
how
much
is
not
done
by
us
or
what
if
we
had
been
taken
sick
how
vigilant
we
are
determined
not
to
live
by
faith
if
we
can
avoid
it
all
the
day
long
on
the
alert
at
night
we
unwillingly
say
our
prayers
and
commit
ourselves
to
uncertainties
so
thoroughly
and
sincerely
are
we
compelled
to
live
reverencing
our
life
and
denying
the
possibility
of
change
this
is
the
only
way
we
say
but
there
are
as
many
ways
as
there
can
be
drawn
radii
from
one
centre
all
change
is
a
miracle
to
contemplate
but
it
is
a
miracle
which
is
taking
place
every
instant
confucius
said
to
know
that
we
know
what
we
know
and
that
we
do
not
know
what
we
do
not
know
that
is
true
knowledge
when
one
man
has
reduced
a
fact
of
the
imagination
to
be
a
fact
to
his
understanding
i
foresee
that
all
men
at
length
establish
their
lives
on
that
basis
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
what
most
of
the
trouble
and
anxiety
which
i
have
referred
to
is
about
and
how
much
it
is
necessary
that
we
be
troubled
or
at
least
careful
it
would
be
some
advantage
to
live
a
primitive
and
frontier
life
though
in
the
midst
of
an
outward
civilization
if
only
to
learn
what
are
the
gross
necessaries
of
life
and
what
methods
have
been
taken
to
obtain
them
or
even
to
look
over
the
old
day
books
of
the
merchants
to
see
what
it
was
that
men
most
commonly
bought
at
the
stores
what
they
stored
that
is
what
are
the
grossest
groceries
for
the
improvements
of
ages
have
had
but
little
influence
on
the
essential
laws
of
man
s
existence
as
our
skeletons
probably
are
not
to
be
distinguished
from
those
of
our
ancestors
by
the
words
necessary
of
life
i
mean
whatever
of
all
that
man
obtains
by
his
own
exertions
has
been
from
the
first
or
from
long
use
has
become
so
important
to
human
life
that
few
if
any
whether
from
savageness
or
poverty
or
philosophy
ever
attempt
to
do
without
it
to
many
creatures
there
is
in
this
sense
but
one
necessary
of
life
food
to
the
bison
of
the
prairie
it
is
a
few
inches
of
palatable
grass
with
water
to
drink
unless
he
seeks
the
shelter
of
the
forest
or
the
mountain
s
shadow
none
of
the
brute
creation
requires
more
than
food
and
shelter
the
necessaries
of
life
for
man
in
this
climate
may
accurately
enough
be
distributed
under
the
several
heads
of
food
shelter
clothing
and
fuel
for
not
till
we
have
secured
these
are
we
prepared
to
entertain
the
true
problems
of
life
with
freedom
and
a
prospect
of
success
man
has
invented
not
only
houses
but
clothes
and
cooked
food
and
possibly
from
the
accidental
discovery
of
the
warmth
of
fire
and
the
consequent
use
of
it
at
first
a
luxury
arose
the
present
necessity
to
sit
by
it
we
observe
cats
and
dogs
acquiring
the
same
second
nature
by
proper
shelter
and
clothing
we
legitimately
retain
our
own
internal
heat
but
with
an
excess
of
these
or
of
fuel
that
is
with
an
external
heat
greater
than
our
own
internal
may
not
cookery
properly
be
said
to
begin
darwin
the
naturalist
says
of
the
inhabitants
of
tierra
del
fuego
that
while
his
own
party
who
were
well
clothed
and
sitting
close
to
a
fire
were
far
from
too
warm
these
naked
savages
who
were
farther
off
were
observed
to
his
great
surprise
to
be
streaming
with
perspiration
at
undergoing
such
a
roasting
so
we
are
told
the
new
hollander
goes
naked
with
impunity
while
the
european
shivers
in
his
clothes
is
it
impossible
to
combine
the
hardiness
of
these
savages
with
the
intellectualness
of
the
civilized
man
according
to
liebig
man
s
body
is
a
stove
and
food
the
fuel
which
keeps
up
the
internal
combustion
in
the
lungs
in
cold
weather
we
eat
more
in
warm
less
the
animal
heat
is
the
result
of
a
slow
combustion
and
disease
and
death
take
place
when
this
is
too
rapid
or
for
want
of
fuel
or
from
some
defect
in
the
draught
the
fire
goes
out
of
course
the
vital
heat
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
fire
but
so
much
for
analogy
it
appears
therefore
from
the
above
list
that
the
expression
animal
life
is
nearly
synonymous
with
the
expression
animal
heat
for
while
food
may
be
regarded
as
the
fuel
which
keeps
up
the
fire
within
us
and
fuel
serves
only
to
prepare
that
food
or
to
increase
the
warmth
of
our
bodies
by
addition
from
without
shelter
and
clothing
also
serve
only
to
retain
the
heat
thus
generated
and
absorbed
the
grand
necessity
then
for
our
bodies
is
to
keep
warm
to
keep
the
vital
heat
in
us
what
pains
we
accordingly
take
not
only
with
our
food
and
clothing
and
shelter
but
with
our
beds
which
are
our
night
clothes
robbing
the
nests
and
breasts
of
birds
to
prepare
this
shelter
within
a
shelter
as
the
mole
has
its
bed
of
grass
and
leaves
at
the
end
of
its
burrow
the
poor
man
is
wont
to
complain
that
this
is
a
cold
world
and
to
cold
no
less
physical
than
social
we
refer
directly
a
great
part
of
our
ails
the
summer
in
some
climates
makes
possible
to
man
a
sort
of
elysian
life
fuel
except
to
cook
his
food
is
then
unnecessary
the
sun
is
his
fire
and
many
of
the
fruits
are
sufficiently
cooked
by
its
rays
while
food
generally
is
more
various
and
more
easily
obtained
and
clothing
and
shelter
are
wholly
or
half
unnecessary
at
the
present
day
and
in
this
country
as
i
find
by
my
own
experience
a
few
implements
a
knife
an
axe
a
spade
a
wheelbarrow
etc
and
for
the
studious
lamplight
stationery
and
access
to
a
few
books
rank
next
to
necessaries
and
can
all
be
obtained
at
a
trifling
cost
yet
some
not
wise
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
globe
to
barbarous
and
unhealthy
regions
and
devote
themselves
to
trade
for
ten
or
twenty
years
in
order
that
they
may
live
that
is
keep
comfortably
warm
and
die
in
new
england
at
last
the
luxuriously
rich
are
not
simply
kept
comfortably
warm
but
unnaturally
hot
as
i
implied
before
they
are
cooked
of
course
la
mode
most
of
the
luxuries
and
many
of
the
so
called
comforts
of
life
are
not
only
not
indispensable
but
positive
hindrances
to
the
elevation
of
mankind
with
respect
to
luxuries
and
comforts
the
wisest
have
ever
lived
a
more
simple
and
meagre
life
than
the
poor
the
ancient
philosophers
chinese
hindoo
persian
and
greek
were
a
class
than
which
none
has
been
poorer
in
outward
riches
none
so
rich
in
inward
we
know
not
much
about
them
it
is
remarkable
that
we
know
so
much
of
them
as
we
do
the
same
is
true
of
the
more
modern
reformers
and
benefactors
of
their
race
none
can
be
an
impartial
or
wise
observer
of
human
life
but
from
the
vantage
ground
of
what
we
should
call
voluntary
poverty
of
a
life
of
luxury
the
fruit
is
luxury
whether
in
agriculture
or
commerce
or
literature
or
art
there
are
nowadays
professors
of
philosophy
but
not
philosophers
yet
it
is
admirable
to
profess
because
it
was
once
admirable
to
live
to
be
a
philosopher
is
not
merely
to
have
subtle
thoughts
nor
even
to
found
a
school
but
so
to
love
wisdom
as
to
live
according
to
its
dictates
a
life
of
simplicity
independence
magnanimity
and
trust
it
is
to
solve
some
of
the
problems
of
life
not
only
theoretically
but
practically
the
success
of
great
scholars
and
thinkers
is
commonly
a
courtier
like
success
not
kingly
not
manly
they
make
shift
to
live
merely
by
conformity
practically
as
their
fathers
did
and
are
in
no
sense
the
progenitors
of
a
noble
race
of
men
but
why
do
men
degenerate
ever
what
makes
families
run
out
what
is
the
nature
of
the
luxury
which
enervates
and
destroys
nations
are
we
sure
that
there
is
none
of
it
in
our
own
lives
the
philosopher
is
in
advance
of
his
age
even
in
the
outward
form
of
his
life
he
is
not
fed
sheltered
clothed
warmed
like
his
contemporaries
how
can
a
man
be
a
philosopher
and
not
maintain
his
vital
heat
by
better
methods
than
other
men
when
a
man
is
warmed
by
the
several
modes
which
i
have
described
what
does
he
want
next
surely
not
more
warmth
of
the
same
kind
as
more
and
richer
food
larger
and
more
splendid
houses
finer
and
more
abundant
clothing
more
numerous
incessant
and
hotter
fires
and
the
like
when
he
has
obtained
those
things
which
are
necessary
to
life
there
is
another
alternative
than
to
obtain
the
superfluities
and
that
is
to
adventure
on
life
now
his
vacation
from
humbler
toil
having
commenced
the
soil
it
appears
is
suited
to
the
seed
for
it
has
sent
its
radicle
downward
and
it
may
now
send
its
shoot
upward
also
with
confidence
why
has
man
rooted
himself
thus
firmly
in
the
earth
but
that
he
may
rise
in
the
same
proportion
into
the
heavens
above
for
the
nobler
plants
are
valued
for
the
fruit
they
bear
at
last
in
the
air
and
light
far
from
the
ground
and
are
not
treated
like
the
humbler
esculents
which
though
they
may
be
biennials
are
cultivated
only
till
they
have
perfected
their
root
and
often
cut
down
at
top
for
this
purpose
so
that
most
would
not
know
them
in
their
flowering
season
i
do
not
mean
to
prescribe
rules
to
strong
and
valiant
natures
who
will
mind
their
own
affairs
whether
in
heaven
or
hell
and
perchance
build
more
magnificently
and
spend
more
lavishly
than
the
richest
without
ever
impoverishing
themselves
not
knowing
how
they
live
if
indeed
there
are
any
such
as
has
been
dreamed
nor
to
those
who
find
their
encouragement
and
inspiration
in
precisely
the
present
condition
of
things
and
cherish
it
with
the
fondness
and
enthusiasm
of
lovers
and
to
some
extent
i
reckon
myself
in
this
number
i
do
not
speak
to
those
who
are
well
employed
in
whatever
circumstances
and
they
know
whether
they
are
well
employed
or
not
but
mainly
to
the
mass
of
men
who
are
discontented
and
idly
complaining
of
the
hardness
of
their
lot
or
of
the
times
when
they
might
improve
them
there
are
some
who
complain
most
energetically
and
inconsolably
of
any
because
they
are
as
they
say
doing
their
duty
i
also
have
in
my
mind
that
seemingly
wealthy
but
most
terribly
impoverished
class
of
all
who
have
accumulated
dross
but
know
not
how
to
use
it
or
get
rid
of
it
and
thus
have
forged
their
own
golden
or
silver
fetters

if
i
should
attempt
to
tell
how
i
have
desired
to
spend
my
life
in
years
past
it
would
probably
surprise
those
of
my
readers
who
are
somewhat
acquainted
with
its
actual
history
it
would
certainly
astonish
those
who
know
nothing
about
it
i
will
only
hint
at
some
of
the
enterprises
which
i
have
cherished
in
any
weather
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
i
have
been
anxious
to
improve
the
nick
of
time
and
notch
it
on
my
stick
too
to
stand
on
the
meeting
of
two
eternities
the
past
and
future
which
is
precisely
the
present
moment
to
toe
that
line
you
will
pardon
some
obscurities
for
there
are
more
secrets
in
my
trade
than
in
most
men
s
and
yet
not
voluntarily
kept
but
inseparable
from
its
very
nature
i
would
gladly
tell
all
that
i
know
about
it
and
never
paint
no
admittance
on
my
gate
i
long
ago
lost
a
hound
a
bay
horse
and
a
turtle
dove
and
am
still
on
their
trail
many
are
the
travellers
i
have
spoken
concerning
them
describing
their
tracks
and
what
calls
they
answered
to
i
have
met
one
or
two
who
had
heard
the
hound
and
the
tramp
of
the
horse
and
even
seen
the
dove
disappear
behind
a
cloud
and
they
seemed
as
anxious
to
recover
them
as
if
they
had
lost
them
themselves
to
anticipate
not
the
sunrise
and
the
dawn
merely
but
if
possible
nature
herself
how
many
mornings
summer
and
winter
before
yet
any
neighbor
was
stirring
about
his
business
have
i
been
about
mine
no
doubt
many
of
my
townsmen
have
met
me
returning
from
this
enterprise
farmers
starting
for
boston
in
the
twilight
or
woodchoppers
going
to
their
work
it
is
true
i
never
assisted
the
sun
materially
in
his
rising
but
doubt
not
it
was
of
the
last
importance
only
to
be
present
at
it
so
many
autumn
ay
and
winter
days
spent
outside
the
town
trying
to
hear
what
was
in
the
wind
to
hear
and
carry
it
express
i
well
nigh
sunk
all
my
capital
in
it
and
lost
my
own
breath
into
the
bargain
running
in
the
face
of
it
if
it
had
concerned
either
of
the
political
parties
depend
upon
it
it
would
have
appeared
in
the
gazette
with
the
earliest
intelligence
at
other
times
watching
from
the
observatory
of
some
cliff
or
tree
to
telegraph
any
new
arrival
or
waiting
at
evening
on
the
hill
tops
for
the
sky
to
fall
that
i
might
catch
something
though
i
never
caught
much
and
that
manna
wise
would
dissolve
again
in
the
sun
for
a
long
time
i
was
reporter
to
a
journal
of
no
very
wide
circulation
whose
editor
has
never
yet
seen
fit
to
print
the
bulk
of
my
contributions
and
as
is
too
common
with
writers
i
got
only
my
labor
for
my
pains
however
in
this
case
my
pains
were
their
own
reward
for
many
years
i
was
self
appointed
inspector
of
snow
storms
and
rain
storms
and
did
my
duty
faithfully
surveyor
if
not
of
highways
then
of
forest
paths
and
all
across
lot
routes
keeping
them
open
and
ravines
bridged
and
passable
at
all
seasons
where
the
public
heel
had
testified
to
their
utility
i
have
looked
after
the
wild
stock
of
the
town
which
give
a
faithful
herdsman
a
good
deal
of
trouble
by
leaping
fences
and
i
have
had
an
eye
to
the
unfrequented
nooks
and
corners
of
the
farm
though
i
did
not
always
know
whether
jonas
or
solomon
worked
in
a
particular
field
to
day
that
was
none
of
my
business
i
have
watered
the
red
huckleberry
the
sand
cherry
and
the
nettle
tree
the
red
pine
and
the
black
ash
the
white
grape
and
the
yellow
violet
which
might
have
withered
else
in
dry
seasons
in
short
i
went
on
thus
for
a
long
time
i
may
say
it
without
boasting
faithfully
minding
my
business
till
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
my
townsmen
would
not
after
all
admit
me
into
the
list
of
town
officers
nor
make
my
place
a
sinecure
with
a
moderate
allowance
my
accounts
which
i
can
swear
to
have
kept
faithfully
i
have
indeed
never
got
audited
still
less
accepted
still
less
paid
and
settled
however
i
have
not
set
my
heart
on
that
not
long
since
a
strolling
indian
went
to
sell
baskets
at
the
house
of
a
well
known
lawyer
in
my
neighborhood
do
you
wish
to
buy
any
baskets
he
asked
no
we
do
not
want
any
was
the
reply
what
exclaimed
the
indian
as
he
went
out
the
gate
do
you
mean
to
starve
us
having
seen
his
industrious
white
neighbors
so
well
off
that
the
lawyer
had
only
to
weave
arguments
and
by
some
magic
wealth
and
standing
followed
he
had
said
to
himself
i
will
go
into
business
i
will
weave
baskets
it
is
a
thing
which
i
can
do
thinking
that
when
he
had
made
the
baskets
he
would
have
done
his
part
and
then
it
would
be
the
white
man
s
to
buy
them
he
had
not
discovered
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
make
it
worth
the
other
s
while
to
buy
them
or
at
least
make
him
think
that
it
was
so
or
to
make
something
else
which
it
would
be
worth
his
while
to
buy
i
too
had
woven
a
kind
of
basket
of
a
delicate
texture
but
i
had
not
made
it
worth
any
one
s
while
to
buy
them
yet
not
the
less
in
my
case
did
i
think
it
worth
my
while
to
weave
them
and
instead
of
studying
how
to
make
it
worth
men
s
while
to
buy
my
baskets
i
studied
rather
how
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
selling
them
the
life
which
men
praise
and
regard
as
successful
is
but
one
kind
why
should
we
exaggerate
any
one
kind
at
the
expense
of
the
others
finding
that
my
fellow
citizens
were
not
likely
to
offer
me
any
room
in
the
court
house
or
any
curacy
or
living
anywhere
else
but
i
must
shift
for
myself
i
turned
my
face
more
exclusively
than
ever
to
the
woods
where
i
was
better
known
i
determined
to
go
into
business
at
once
and
not
wait
to
acquire
the
usual
capital
using
such
slender
means
as
i
had
already
got
my
purpose
in
going
to
walden
pond
was
not
to
live
cheaply
nor
to
live
dearly
there
but
to
transact
some
private
business
with
the
fewest
obstacles
to
be
hindered
from
accomplishing
which
for
want
of
a
little
common
sense
a
little
enterprise
and
business
talent
appeared
not
so
sad
as
foolish
i
have
always
endeavored
to
acquire
strict
business
habits
they
are
indispensable
to
every
man
if
your
trade
is
with
the
celestial
empire
then
some
small
counting
house
on
the
coast
in
some
salem
harbor
will
be
fixture
enough
you
will
export
such
articles
as
the
country
affords
purely
native
products
much
ice
and
pine
timber
and
a
little
granite
always
in
native
bottoms
these
will
be
good
ventures
to
oversee
all
the
details
yourself
in
person
to
be
at
once
pilot
and
captain
and
owner
and
underwriter
to
buy
and
sell
and
keep
the
accounts
to
read
every
letter
received
and
write
or
read
every
letter
sent
to
superintend
the
discharge
of
imports
night
and
day
to
be
upon
many
parts
of
the
coast
almost
at
the
same
time
often
the
richest
freight
will
be
discharged
upon
a
jersey
shore
to
be
your
own
telegraph
unweariedly
sweeping
the
horizon
speaking
all
passing
vessels
bound
coastwise
to
keep
up
a
steady
despatch
of
commodities
for
the
supply
of
such
a
distant
and
exorbitant
market
to
keep
yourself
informed
of
the
state
of
the
markets
prospects
of
war
and
peace
everywhere
and
anticipate
the
tendencies
of
trade
and
civilization
taking
advantage
of
the
results
of
all
exploring
expeditions
using
new
passages
and
all
improvements
in
navigation
charts
to
be
studied
the
position
of
reefs
and
new
lights
and
buoys
to
be
ascertained
and
ever
and
ever
the
logarithmic
tables
to
be
corrected
for
by
the
error
of
some
calculator
the
vessel
often
splits
upon
a
rock
that
should
have
reached
a
friendly
pier
there
is
the
untold
fate
of
la
prouse
universal
science
to
be
kept
pace
with
studying
the
lives
of
all
great
discoverers
and
navigators
great
adventurers
and
merchants
from
hanno
and
the
phoenicians
down
to
our
day
in
fine
account
of
stock
to
be
taken
from
time
to
time
to
know
how
you
stand
it
is
a
labor
to
task
the
faculties
of
a
man
such
problems
of
profit
and
loss
of
interest
of
tare
and
tret
and
gauging
of
all
kinds
in
it
as
demand
a
universal
knowledge
i
have
thought
that
walden
pond
would
be
a
good
place
for
business
not
solely
on
account
of
the
railroad
and
the
ice
trade
it
offers
advantages
which
it
may
not
be
good
policy
to
divulge
it
is
a
good
port
and
a
good
foundation
no
neva
marshes
to
be
filled
though
you
must
everywhere
build
on
piles
of
your
own
driving
it
is
said
that
a
flood
tide
with
a
westerly
wind
and
ice
in
the
neva
would
sweep
st
petersburg
from
the
face
of
the
earth
as
this
business
was
to
be
entered
into
without
the
usual
capital
it
may
not
be
easy
to
conjecture
where
those
means
that
will
still
be
indispensable
to
every
such
undertaking
were
to
be
obtained
as
for
clothing
to
come
at
once
to
the
practical
part
of
the
question
perhaps
we
are
led
oftener
by
the
love
of
novelty
and
a
regard
for
the
opinions
of
men
in
procuring
it
than
by
a
true
utility
let
him
who
has
work
to
do
recollect
that
the
object
of
clothing
is
first
to
retain
the
vital
heat
and
secondly
in
this
state
of
society
to
cover
nakedness
and
he
may
judge
how
much
of
any
necessary
or
important
work
may
be
accomplished
without
adding
to
his
wardrobe
kings
and
queens
who
wear
a
suit
but
once
though
made
by
some
tailor
or
dressmaker
to
their
majesties
cannot
know
the
comfort
of
wearing
a
suit
that
fits
they
are
no
better
than
wooden
horses
to
hang
the
clean
clothes
on
every
day
our
garments
become
more
assimilated
to
ourselves
receiving
the
impress
of
the
wearer
s
character
until
we
hesitate
to
lay
them
aside
without
such
delay
and
medical
appliances
and
some
such
solemnity
even
as
our
bodies
no
man
ever
stood
the
lower
in
my
estimation
for
having
a
patch
in
his
clothes
yet
i
am
sure
that
there
is
greater
anxiety
commonly
to
have
fashionable
or
at
least
clean
and
unpatched
clothes
than
to
have
a
sound
conscience
but
even
if
the
rent
is
not
mended
perhaps
the
worst
vice
betrayed
is
improvidence
i
sometimes
try
my
acquaintances
by
such
tests
as
this
who
could
wear
a
patch
or
two
extra
seams
only
over
the
knee
most
behave
as
if
they
believed
that
their
prospects
for
life
would
be
ruined
if
they
should
do
it
it
would
be
easier
for
them
to
hobble
to
town
with
a
broken
leg
than
with
a
broken
pantaloon
often
if
an
accident
happens
to
a
gentleman
s
legs
they
can
be
mended
but
if
a
similar
accident
happens
to
the
legs
of
his
pantaloons
there
is
no
help
for
it
for
he
considers
not
what
is
truly
respectable
but
what
is
respected
we
know
but
few
men
a
great
many
coats
and
breeches
dress
a
scarecrow
in
your
last
shift
you
standing
shiftless
by
who
would
not
soonest
salute
the
scarecrow
passing
a
cornfield
the
other
day
close
by
a
hat
and
coat
on
a
stake
i
recognized
the
owner
of
the
farm
he
was
only
a
little
more
weather
beaten
than
when
i
saw
him
last
i
have
heard
of
a
dog
that
barked
at
every
stranger
who
approached
his
master
s
premises
with
clothes
on
but
was
easily
quieted
by
a
naked
thief
it
is
an
interesting
question
how
far
men
would
retain
their
relative
rank
if
they
were
divested
of
their
clothes
could
you
in
such
a
case
tell
surely
of
any
company
of
civilized
men
which
belonged
to
the
most
respected
class
when
madam
pfeiffer
in
her
adventurous
travels
round
the
world
from
east
to
west
had
got
so
near
home
as
asiatic
russia
she
says
that
she
felt
the
necessity
of
wearing
other
than
a
travelling
dress
when
she
went
to
meet
the
authorities
for
she
was
now
in
a
civilized
country
where
people
are
judged
of
by
their
clothes
even
in
our
democratic
new
england
towns
the
accidental
possession
of
wealth
and
its
manifestation
in
dress
and
equipage
alone
obtain
for
the
possessor
almost
universal
respect
but
they
yield
such
respect
numerous
as
they
are
are
so
far
heathen
and
need
to
have
a
missionary
sent
to
them
beside
clothes
introduced
sewing
a
kind
of
work
which
you
may
call
endless
a
woman
s
dress
at
least
is
never
done
a
man
who
has
at
length
found
something
to
do
will
not
need
to
get
a
new
suit
to
do
it
in
for
him
the
old
will
do
that
has
lain
dusty
in
the
garret
for
an
indeterminate
period
old
shoes
will
serve
a
hero
longer
than
they
have
served
his
valet
if
a
hero
ever
has
a
valet
bare
feet
are
older
than
shoes
and
he
can
make
them
do
only
they
who
go
to
soir
es
and
legislative
balls
must
have
new
coats
coats
to
change
as
often
as
the
man
changes
in
them
but
if
my
jacket
and
trousers
my
hat
and
shoes
are
fit
to
worship
god
in
they
will
do
will
they
not
who
ever
saw
his
old
clothes
his
old
coat
actually
worn
out
resolved
into
its
primitive
elements
so
that
it
was
not
a
deed
of
charity
to
bestow
it
on
some
poor
boy
by
him
perchance
to
be
bestowed
on
some
poorer
still
or
shall
we
say
richer
who
could
do
with
less
i
say
beware
of
all
enterprises
that
require
new
clothes
and
not
rather
a
new
wearer
of
clothes
if
there
is
not
a
new
man
how
can
the
new
clothes
be
made
to
fit
if
you
have
any
enterprise
before
you
try
it
in
your
old
clothes
all
men
want
not
something
to
do
with
but
something
to
do
or
rather
something
to
be
perhaps
we
should
never
procure
a
new
suit
however
ragged
or
dirty
the
old
until
we
have
so
conducted
so
enterprised
or
sailed
in
some
way
that
we
feel
like
new
men
in
the
old
and
that
to
retain
it
would
be
like
keeping
new
wine
in
old
bottles
our
moulting
season
like
that
of
the
fowls
must
be
a
crisis
in
our
lives
the
loon
retires
to
solitary
ponds
to
spend
it
thus
also
the
snake
casts
its
slough
and
the
caterpillar
its
wormy
coat
by
an
internal
industry
and
expansion
for
clothes
are
but
our
outmost
cuticle
and
mortal
coil
otherwise
we
shall
be
found
sailing
under
false
colors
and
be
inevitably
cashiered
at
last
by
our
own
opinion
as
well
as
that
of
mankind
we
don
garment
after
garment
as
if
we
grew
like
exogenous
plants
by
addition
without
our
outside
and
often
thin
and
fanciful
clothes
are
our
epidermis
or
false
skin
which
partakes
not
of
our
life
and
may
be
stripped
off
here
and
there
without
fatal
injury
our
thicker
garments
constantly
worn
are
our
cellular
integument
or
cortex
but
our
shirts
are
our
liber
or
true
bark
which
cannot
be
removed
without
girdling
and
so
destroying
the
man
i
believe
that
all
races
at
some
seasons
wear
something
equivalent
to
the
shirt
it
is
desirable
that
a
man
be
clad
so
simply
that
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
himself
in
the
dark
and
that
he
live
in
all
respects
so
compactly
and
preparedly
that
if
an
enemy
take
the
town
he
can
like
the
old
philosopher
walk
out
the
gate
empty
handed
without
anxiety
while
one
thick
garment
is
for
most
purposes
as
good
as
three
thin
ones
and
cheap
clothing
can
be
obtained
at
prices
really
to
suit
customers
while
a
thick
coat
can
be
bought
for
five
dollars
which
will
last
as
many
years
thick
pantaloons
for
two
dollars
cowhide
boots
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
pair
a
summer
hat
for
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
and
a
winter
cap
for
sixty
two
and
a
half
cents
or
a
better
be
made
at
home
at
a
nominal
cost
where
is
he
so
poor
that
clad
in
such
a
suit
of
his
own
earning
there
will
not
be
found
wise
men
to
do
him
reverence
when
i
ask
for
a
garment
of
a
particular
form
my
tailoress
tells
me
gravely
they
do
not
make
them
so
now
not
emphasizing
the
they
at
all
as
if
she
quoted
an
authority
as
impersonal
as
the
fates
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
get
made
what
i
want
simply
because
she
cannot
believe
that
i
mean
what
i
say
that
i
am
so
rash
when
i
hear
this
oracular
sentence
i
am
for
a
moment
absorbed
in
thought
emphasizing
to
myself
each
word
separately
that
i
may
come
at
the
meaning
of
it
that
i
may
find
out
by
what
degree
of
consanguinity
they
are
related
to
me
and
what
authority
they
may
have
in
an
affair
which
affects
me
so
nearly
and
finally
i
am
inclined
to
answer
her
with
equal
mystery
and
without
any
more
emphasis
of
the
they
it
is
true
they
did
not
make
them
so
recently
but
they
do
now
of
what
use
this
measuring
of
me
if
she
does
not
measure
my
character
but
only
the
breadth
of
my
shoulders
as
it
were
a
peg
to
bang
the
coat
on
we
worship
not
the
graces
nor
the
parcae
but
fashion
she
spins
and
weaves
and
cuts
with
full
authority
the
head
monkey
at
paris
puts
on
a
traveller
s
cap
and
all
the
monkeys
in
america
do
the
same
i
sometimes
despair
of
getting
anything
quite
simple
and
honest
done
in
this
world
by
the
help
of
men
they
would
have
to
be
passed
through
a
powerful
press
first
to
squeeze
their
old
notions
out
of
them
so
that
they
would
not
soon
get
upon
their
legs
again
and
then
there
would
be
some
one
in
the
company
with
a
maggot
in
his
head
hatched
from
an
egg
deposited
there
nobody
knows
when
for
not
even
fire
kills
these
things
and
you
would
have
lost
your
labor
nevertheless
we
will
not
forget
that
some
egyptian
wheat
was
handed
down
to
us
by
a
mummy
on
the
whole
i
think
that
it
cannot
be
maintained
that
dressing
has
in
this
or
any
country
risen
to
the
dignity
of
an
art
at
present
men
make
shift
to
wear
what
they
can
get
like
shipwrecked
sailors
they
put
on
what
they
can
find
on
the
beach
and
at
a
little
distance
whether
of
space
or
time
laugh
at
each
other
s
masquerade
every
generation
laughs
at
the
old
fashions
but
follows
religiously
the
new
we
are
amused
at
beholding
the
costume
of
henry
viii
or
queen
elizabeth
as
much
as
if
it
was
that
of
the
king
and
queen
of
the
cannibal
islands
all
costume
off
a
man
is
pitiful
or
grotesque
it
is
only
the
serious
eye
peering
from
and
the
sincere
life
passed
within
it
which
restrain
laughter
and
consecrate
the
costume
of
any
people
let
harlequin
be
taken
with
a
fit
of
the
colic
and
his
trappings
will
have
to
serve
that
mood
too
when
the
soldier
is
hit
by
a
cannonball
rags
are
as
becoming
as
purple
the
childish
and
savage
taste
of
men
and
women
for
new
patterns
keeps
how
many
shaking
and
squinting
through
kaleidoscopes
that
they
may
discover
the
particular
figure
which
this
generation
requires
today
the
manufacturers
have
learned
that
this
taste
is
merely
whimsical
of
two
patterns
which
differ
only
by
a
few
threads
more
or
less
of
a
particular
color
the
one
will
be
sold
readily
the
other
lie
on
the
shelf
though
it
frequently
happens
that
after
the
lapse
of
a
season
the
latter
becomes
the
most
fashionable
comparatively
tattooing
is
not
the
hideous
custom
which
it
is
called
it
is
not
barbarous
merely
because
the
printing
is
skin
deep
and
unalterable
i
cannot
believe
that
our
factory
system
is
the
best
mode
by
which
men
may
get
clothing
the
condition
of
the
operatives
is
becoming
every
day
more
like
that
of
the
english
and
it
cannot
be
wondered
at
since
as
far
as
i
have
heard
or
observed
the
principal
object
is
not
that
mankind
may
be
well
and
honestly
clad
but
unquestionably
that
corporations
may
be
enriched
in
the
long
run
men
hit
only
what
they
aim
at
therefore
though
they
should
fail
immediately
they
had
better
aim
at
something
high
as
for
a
shelter
i
will
not
deny
that
this
is
now
a
necessary
of
life
though
there
are
instances
of
men
having
done
without
it
for
long
periods
in
colder
countries
than
this
samuel
laing
says
that
the
laplander
in
his
skin
dress
and
in
a
skin
bag
which
he
puts
over
his
head
and
shoulders
will
sleep
night
after
night
on
the
snow
in
a
degree
of
cold
which
would
extinguish
the
life
of
one
exposed
to
it
in
any
woollen
clothing
he
had
seen
them
asleep
thus
yet
he
adds
they
are
not
hardier
than
other
people
but
probably
man
did
not
live
long
on
the
earth
without
discovering
the
convenience
which
there
is
in
a
house
the
domestic
comforts
which
phrase
may
have
originally
signified
the
satisfactions
of
the
house
more
than
of
the
family
though
these
must
be
extremely
partial
and
occasional
in
those
climates
where
the
house
is
associated
in
our
thoughts
with
winter
or
the
rainy
season
chiefly
and
two
thirds
of
the
year
except
for
a
parasol
is
unnecessary
in
our
climate
in
the
summer
it
was
formerly
almost
solely
a
covering
at
night
in
the
indian
gazettes
a
wigwam
was
the
symbol
of
a
day
s
march
and
a
row
of
them
cut
or
painted
on
the
bark
of
a
tree
signified
that
so
many
times
they
had
camped
man
was
not
made
so
large
limbed
and
robust
but
that
he
must
seek
to
narrow
his
world
and
wall
in
a
space
such
as
fitted
him
he
was
at
first
bare
and
out
of
doors
but
though
this
was
pleasant
enough
in
serene
and
warm
weather
by
daylight
the
rainy
season
and
the
winter
to
say
nothing
of
the
torrid
sun
would
perhaps
have
nipped
his
race
in
the
bud
if
he
had
not
made
haste
to
clothe
himself
with
the
shelter
of
a
house
adam
and
eve
according
to
the
fable
wore
the
bower
before
other
clothes
man
wanted
a
home
a
place
of
warmth
or
comfort
first
of
warmth
then
the
warmth
of
the
affections
we
may
imagine
a
time
when
in
the
infancy
of
the
human
race
some
enterprising
mortal
crept
into
a
hollow
in
a
rock
for
shelter
every
child
begins
the
world
again
to
some
extent
and
loves
to
stay
outdoors
even
in
wet
and
cold
it
plays
house
as
well
as
horse
having
an
instinct
for
it
who
does
not
remember
the
interest
with
which
when
young
he
looked
at
shelving
rocks
or
any
approach
to
a
cave
it
was
the
natural
yearning
of
that
portion
any
portion
of
our
most
primitive
ancestor
which
still
survived
in
us
from
the
cave
we
have
advanced
to
roofs
of
palm
leaves
of
bark
and
boughs
of
linen
woven
and
stretched
of
grass
and
straw
of
boards
and
shingles
of
stones
and
tiles
at
last
we
know
not
what
it
is
to
live
in
the
open
air
and
our
lives
are
domestic
in
more
senses
than
we
think
from
the
hearth
the
field
is
a
great
distance
it
would
be
well
perhaps
if
we
were
to
spend
more
of
our
days
and
nights
without
any
obstruction
between
us
and
the
celestial
bodies
if
the
poet
did
not
speak
so
much
from
under
a
roof
or
the
saint
dwell
there
so
long
birds
do
not
sing
in
caves
nor
do
doves
cherish
their
innocence
in
dovecots
however
if
one
designs
to
construct
a
dwelling
house
it
behooves
him
to
exercise
a
little
yankee
shrewdness
lest
after
all
he
find
himself
in
a
workhouse
a
labyrinth
without
a
clue
a
museum
an
almshouse
a
prison
or
a
splendid
mausoleum
instead
consider
first
how
slight
a
shelter
is
absolutely
necessary
i
have
seen
penobscot
indians
in
this
town
living
in
tents
of
thin
cotton
cloth
while
the
snow
was
nearly
a
foot
deep
around
them
and
i
thought
that
they
would
be
glad
to
have
it
deeper
to
keep
out
the
wind
formerly
when
how
to
get
my
living
honestly
with
freedom
left
for
my
proper
pursuits
was
a
question
which
vexed
me
even
more
than
it
does
now
for
unfortunately
i
am
become
somewhat
callous
i
used
to
see
a
large
box
by
the
railroad
six
feet
long
by
three
wide
in
which
the
laborers
locked
up
their
tools
at
night
and
it
suggested
to
me
that
every
man
who
was
hard
pushed
might
get
such
a
one
for
a
dollar
and
having
bored
a
few
auger
holes
in
it
to
admit
the
air
at
least
get
into
it
when
it
rained
and
at
night
and
hook
down
the
lid
and
so
have
freedom
in
his
love
and
in
his
soul
be
free
this
did
not
appear
the
worst
nor
by
any
means
a
despicable
alternative
you
could
sit
up
as
late
as
you
pleased
and
whenever
you
got
up
go
abroad
without
any
landlord
or
house
lord
dogging
you
for
rent
many
a
man
is
harassed
to
death
to
pay
the
rent
of
a
larger
and
more
luxurious
box
who
would
not
have
frozen
to
death
in
such
a
box
as
this
i
am
far
from
jesting
economy
is
a
subject
which
admits
of
being
treated
with
levity
but
it
cannot
so
be
disposed
of
a
comfortable
house
for
a
rude
and
hardy
race
that
lived
mostly
out
of
doors
was
once
made
here
almost
entirely
of
such
materials
as
nature
furnished
ready
to
their
hands
gookin
who
was
superintendent
of
the
indians
subject
to
the
massachusetts
colony
writing
in
1674
says
the
best
of
their
houses
are
covered
very
neatly
tight
and
warm
with
barks
of
trees
slipped
from
their
bodies
at
those
seasons
when
the
sap
is
up
and
made
into
great
flakes
with
pressure
of
weighty
timber
when
they
are
green
the
meaner
sort
are
covered
with
mats
which
they
make
of
a
kind
of
bulrush
and
are
also
indifferently
tight
and
warm
but
not
so
good
as
the
former
some
i
have
seen
sixty
or
a
hundred
feet
long
and
thirty
feet
broad
i
have
often
lodged
in
their
wigwams
and
found
them
as
warm
as
the
best
english
houses
he
adds
that
they
were
commonly
carpeted
and
lined
within
with
well
wrought
embroidered
mats
and
were
furnished
with
various
utensils
the
indians
had
advanced
so
far
as
to
regulate
the
effect
of
the
wind
by
a
mat
suspended
over
the
hole
in
the
roof
and
moved
by
a
string
such
a
lodge
was
in
the
first
instance
constructed
in
a
day
or
two
at
most
and
taken
down
and
put
up
in
a
few
hours
and
every
family
owned
one
or
its
apartment
in
one
in
the
savage
state
every
family
owns
a
shelter
as
good
as
the
best
and
sufficient
for
its
coarser
and
simpler
wants
but
i
think
that
i
speak
within
bounds
when
i
say
that
though
the
birds
of
the
air
have
their
nests
and
the
foxes
their
holes
and
the
savages
their
wigwams
in
modern
civilized
society
not
more
than
one
half
the
families
own
a
shelter
in
the
large
towns
and
cities
where
civilization
especially
prevails
the
number
of
those
who
own
a
shelter
is
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
whole
the
rest
pay
an
annual
tax
for
this
outside
garment
of
all
become
indispensable
summer
and
winter
which
would
buy
a
village
of
indian
wigwams
but
now
helps
to
keep
them
poor
as
long
as
they
live
i
do
not
mean
to
insist
here
on
the
disadvantage
of
hiring
compared
with
owning
but
it
is
evident
that
the
savage
owns
his
shelter
because
it
costs
so
little
while
the
civilized
man
hires
his
commonly
because
he
cannot
afford
to
own
it
nor
can
he
in
the
long
run
any
better
afford
to
hire
but
answers
one
by
merely
paying
this
tax
the
poor
civilized
man
secures
an
abode
which
is
a
palace
compared
with
the
savage
s
an
annual
rent
of
from
twenty
five
to
a
hundred
dollars
these
are
the
country
rates
entitles
him
to
the
benefit
of
the
improvements
of
centuries
spacious
apartments
clean
paint
and
paper
rumford
fire
place
back
plastering
venetian
blinds
copper
pump
spring
lock
a
commodious
cellar
and
many
other
things
but
how
happens
it
that
he
who
is
said
to
enjoy
these
things
is
so
commonly
a
poor
civilized
man
while
the
savage
who
has
them
not
is
rich
as
a
savage
if
it
is
asserted
that
civilization
is
a
real
advance
in
the
condition
of
man
and
i
think
that
it
is
though
only
the
wise
improve
their
advantages
it
must
be
shown
that
it
has
produced
better
dwellings
without
making
them
more
costly
and
the
cost
of
a
thing
is
the
amount
of
what
i
will
call
life
which
is
required
to
be
exchanged
for
it
immediately
or
in
the
long
run
an
average
house
in
this
neighborhood
costs
perhaps
eight
hundred
dollars
and
to
lay
up
this
sum
will
take
from
ten
to
fifteen
years
of
the
laborer
s
life
even
if
he
is
not
encumbered
with
a
family
estimating
the
pecuniary
value
of
every
man
s
labor
at
one
dollar
a
day
for
if
some
receive
more
others
receive
less
so
that
he
must
have
spent
more
than
half
his
life
commonly
before
his
wigwam
will
be
earned
if
we
suppose
him
to
pay
a
rent
instead
this
is
but
a
doubtful
choice
of
evils
would
the
savage
have
been
wise
to
exchange
his
wigwam
for
a
palace
on
these
terms
it
may
be
guessed
that
i
reduce
almost
the
whole
advantage
of
holding
this
superfluous
property
as
a
fund
in
store
against
the
future
so
far
as
the
individual
is
concerned
mainly
to
the
defraying
of
funeral
expenses
but
perhaps
a
man
is
not
required
to
bury
himself
nevertheless
this
points
to
an
important
distinction
between
the
civilized
man
and
the
savage
and
no
doubt
they
have
designs
on
us
for
our
benefit
in
making
the
life
of
a
civilized
people
an
institution
in
which
the
life
of
the
individual
is
to
a
great
extent
absorbed
in
order
to
preserve
and
perfect
that
of
the
race
but
i
wish
to
show
at
what
a
sacrifice
this
advantage
is
at
present
obtained
and
to
suggest
that
we
may
possibly
so
live
as
to
secure
all
the
advantage
without
suffering
any
of
the
disadvantage
what
mean
ye
by
saying
that
the
poor
ye
have
always
with
you
or
that
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
children
s
teeth
are
set
on
edge
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
god
ye
shall
not
have
occasion
any
more
to
use
this
proverb
in
israel
behold
all
souls
are
mine
as
the
soul
of
the
father
so
also
the
soul
of
the
son
is
mine
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
when
i
consider
my
neighbors
the
farmers
of
concord
who
are
at
least
as
well
off
as
the
other
classes
i
find
that
for
the
most
part
they
have
been
toiling
twenty
thirty
or
forty
years
that
they
may
become
the
real
owners
of
their
farms
which
commonly
they
have
inherited
with
encumbrances
or
else
bought
with
hired
money
and
we
may
regard
one
third
of
that
toil
as
the
cost
of
their
houses
but
commonly
they
have
not
paid
for
them
yet
it
is
true
the
encumbrances
sometimes
outweigh
the
value
of
the
farm
so
that
the
farm
itself
becomes
one
great
encumbrance
and
still
a
man
is
found
to
inherit
it
being
well
acquainted
with
it
as
he
says
on
applying
to
the
assessors
i
am
surprised
to
learn
that
they
cannot
at
once
name
a
dozen
in
the
town
who
own
their
farms
free
and
clear
if
you
would
know
the
history
of
these
homesteads
inquire
at
the
bank
where
they
are
mortgaged
the
man
who
has
actually
paid
for
his
farm
with
labor
on
it
is
so
rare
that
every
neighbor
can
point
to
him
i
doubt
if
there
are
three
such
men
in
concord
what
has
been
said
of
the
merchants
that
a
very
large
majority
even
ninety
seven
in
a
hundred
are
sure
to
fail
is
equally
true
of
the
farmers
with
regard
to
the
merchants
however
one
of
them
says
pertinently
that
a
great
part
of
their
failures
are
not
genuine
pecuniary
failures
but
merely
failures
to
fulfil
their
engagements
because
it
is
inconvenient
that
is
it
is
the
moral
character
that
breaks
down
but
this
puts
an
infinitely
worse
face
on
the
matter
and
suggests
beside
that
probably
not
even
the
other
three
succeed
in
saving
their
souls
but
are
perchance
bankrupt
in
a
worse
sense
than
they
who
fail
honestly
bankruptcy
and
repudiation
are
the
springboards
from
which
much
of
our
civilization
vaults
and
turns
its
somersets
but
the
savage
stands
on
the
unelastic
plank
of
famine
yet
the
middlesex
cattle
show
goes
off
here
with
clat
annually
as
if
all
the
joints
of
the
agricultural
machine
were
suent
the
farmer
is
endeavoring
to
solve
the
problem
of
a
livelihood
by
a
formula
more
complicated
than
the
problem
itself
to
get
his
shoestrings
he
speculates
in
herds
of
cattle
with
consummate
skill
he
has
set
his
trap
with
a
hair
spring
to
catch
comfort
and
independence
and
then
as
he
turned
away
got
his
own
leg
into
it
this
is
the
reason
he
is
poor
and
for
a
similar
reason
we
are
all
poor
in
respect
to
a
thousand
savage
comforts
though
surrounded
by
luxuries
as
chapman
sings
the
false
society
of
men
for
earthly
greatness
all
heavenly
comforts
rarefies
to
air
and
when
the
farmer
has
got
his
house
he
may
not
be
the
richer
but
the
poorer
for
it
and
it
be
the
house
that
has
got
him
as
i
understand
it
that
was
a
valid
objection
urged
by
momus
against
the
house
which
minerva
made
that
she
had
not
made
it
movable
by
which
means
a
bad
neighborhood
might
be
avoided
and
it
may
still
be
urged
for
our
houses
are
such
unwieldy
property
that
we
are
often
imprisoned
rather
than
housed
in
them
and
the
bad
neighborhood
to
be
avoided
is
our
own
scurvy
selves
i
know
one
or
two
families
at
least
in
this
town
who
for
nearly
a
generation
have
been
wishing
to
sell
their
houses
in
the
outskirts
and
move
into
the
village
but
have
not
been
able
to
accomplish
it
and
only
death
will
set
them
free
granted
that
the
majority
are
able
at
last
either
to
own
or
hire
the
modern
house
with
all
its
improvements
while
civilization
has
been
improving
our
houses
it
has
not
equally
improved
the
men
who
are
to
inhabit
them
it
has
created
palaces
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
create
noblemen
and
kings
and
if
the
civilized
man
s
pursuits
are
no
worthier
than
the
savage
s
if
he
is
employed
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
obtaining
gross
necessaries
and
comforts
merely
why
should
he
have
a
better
dwelling
than
the
former
but
how
do
the
poor
minority
fare
perhaps
it
will
be
found
that
just
in
proportion
as
some
have
been
placed
in
outward
circumstances
above
the
savage
others
have
been
degraded
below
him
the
luxury
of
one
class
is
counterbalanced
by
the
indigence
of
another
on
the
one
side
is
the
palace
on
the
other
are
the
almshouse
and
silent
poor
the
myriads
who
built
the
pyramids
to
be
the
tombs
of
the
pharaohs
were
fed
on
garlic
and
it
may
be
were
not
decently
buried
themselves
the
mason
who
finishes
the
cornice
of
the
palace
returns
at
night
perchance
to
a
hut
not
so
good
as
a
wigwam
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
in
a
country
where
the
usual
evidences
of
civilization
exist
the
condition
of
a
very
large
body
of
the
inhabitants
may
not
be
as
degraded
as
that
of
savages
i
refer
to
the
degraded
poor
not
now
to
the
degraded
rich
to
know
this
i
should
not
need
to
look
farther
than
to
the
shanties
which
everywhere
border
our
railroads
that
last
improvement
in
civilization
where
i
see
in
my
daily
walks
human
beings
living
in
sties
and
all
winter
with
an
open
door
for
the
sake
of
light
without
any
visible
often
imaginable
wood
pile
and
the
forms
of
both
old
and
young
are
permanently
contracted
by
the
long
habit
of
shrinking
from
cold
and
misery
and
the
development
of
all
their
limbs
and
faculties
is
checked
it
certainly
is
fair
to
look
at
that
class
by
whose
labor
the
works
which
distinguish
this
generation
are
accomplished
such
too
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
is
the
condition
of
the
operatives
of
every
denomination
in
england
which
is
the
great
workhouse
of
the
world
or
i
could
refer
you
to
ireland
which
is
marked
as
one
of
the
white
or
enlightened
spots
on
the
map
contrast
the
physical
condition
of
the
irish
with
that
of
the
north
american
indian
or
the
south
sea
islander
or
any
other
savage
race
before
it
was
degraded
by
contact
with
the
civilized
man
yet
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
people
s
rulers
are
as
wise
as
the
average
of
civilized
rulers
their
condition
only
proves
what
squalidness
may
consist
with
civilization
i
hardly
need
refer
now
to
the
laborers
in
our
southern
states
who
produce
the
staple
exports
of
this
country
and
are
themselves
a
staple
production
of
the
south
but
to
confine
myself
to
those
who
are
said
to
be
in
moderate
circumstances
most
men
appear
never
to
have
considered
what
a
house
is
and
are
actually
though
needlessly
poor
all
their
lives
because
they
think
that
they
must
have
such
a
one
as
their
neighbors
have
as
if
one
were
to
wear
any
sort
of
coat
which
the
tailor
might
cut
out
for
him
or
gradually
leaving
off
palm
leaf
hat
or
cap
of
woodchuck
skin
complain
of
hard
times
because
he
could
not
afford
to
buy
him
a
crown
it
is
possible
to
invent
a
house
still
more
convenient
and
luxurious
than
we
have
which
yet
all
would
admit
that
man
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
shall
we
always
study
to
obtain
more
of
these
things
and
not
sometimes
to
be
content
with
less
shall
the
respectable
citizen
thus
gravely
teach
by
precept
and
example
the
necessity
of
the
young
man
s
providing
a
certain
number
of
superfluous
glow
shoes
and
umbrellas
and
empty
guest
chambers
for
empty
guests
before
he
dies
why
should
not
our
furniture
be
as
simple
as
the
arab
s
or
the
indian
s
when
i
think
of
the
benefactors
of
the
race
whom
we
have
apotheosized
as
messengers
from
heaven
bearers
of
divine
gifts
to
man
i
do
not
see
in
my
mind
any
retinue
at
their
heels
any
carload
of
fashionable
furniture
or
what
if
i
were
to
allow
would
it
not
be
a
singular
allowance
that
our
furniture
should
be
more
complex
than
the
arab
s
in
proportion
as
we
are
morally
and
intellectually
his
superiors
at
present
our
houses
are
cluttered
and
defiled
with
it
and
a
good
housewife
would
sweep
out
the
greater
part
into
the
dust
hole
and
not
leave
her
morning
s
work
undone
morning
work
by
the
blushes
of
aurora
and
the
music
of
memnon
what
should
be
man
s
morning
work
in
this
world
i
had
three
pieces
of
limestone
on
my
desk
but
i
was
terrified
to
find
that
they
required
to
be
dusted
daily
when
the
furniture
of
my
mind
was
all
undusted
still
and
threw
them
out
the
window
in
disgust
how
then
could
i
have
a
furnished
house
i
would
rather
sit
in
the
open
air
for
no
dust
gathers
on
the
grass
unless
where
man
has
broken
ground
it
is
the
luxurious
and
dissipated
who
set
the
fashions
which
the
herd
so
diligently
follow
the
traveller
who
stops
at
the
best
houses
so
called
soon
discovers
this
for
the
publicans
presume
him
to
be
a
sardanapalus
and
if
he
resigned
himself
to
their
tender
mercies
he
would
soon
be
completely
emasculated
i
think
that
in
the
railroad
car
we
are
inclined
to
spend
more
on
luxury
than
on
safety
and
convenience
and
it
threatens
without
attaining
these
to
become
no
better
than
a
modern
drawing
room
with
its
divans
and
ottomans
and
sun
shades
and
a
hundred
other
oriental
things
which
we
are
taking
west
with
us
invented
for
the
ladies
of
the
harem
and
the
effeminate
natives
of
the
celestial
empire
which
jonathan
should
be
ashamed
to
know
the
names
of
i
would
rather
sit
on
a
pumpkin
and
have
it
all
to
myself
than
be
crowded
on
a
velvet
cushion
i
would
rather
ride
on
earth
in
an
ox
cart
with
a
free
circulation
than
go
to
heaven
in
the
fancy
car
of
an
excursion
train
and
breathe
a
malaria
all
the
way
the
very
simplicity
and
nakedness
of
man
s
life
in
the
primitive
ages
imply
this
advantage
at
least
that
they
left
him
still
but
a
sojourner
in
nature
when
he
was
refreshed
with
food
and
sleep
he
contemplated
his
journey
again
he
dwelt
as
it
were
in
a
tent
in
this
world
and
was
either
threading
the
valleys
or
crossing
the
plains
or
climbing
the
mountain
tops
but
lo
men
have
become
the
tools
of
their
tools
the
man
who
independently
plucked
the
fruits
when
he
was
hungry
is
become
a
farmer
and
he
who
stood
under
a
tree
for
shelter
a
housekeeper
we
now
no
longer
camp
as
for
a
night
but
have
settled
down
on
earth
and
forgotten
heaven
we
have
adopted
christianity
merely
as
an
improved
method
of
agri
culture
we
have
built
for
this
world
a
family
mansion
and
for
the
next
a
family
tomb
the
best
works
of
art
are
the
expression
of
man
s
struggle
to
free
himself
from
this
condition
but
the
effect
of
our
art
is
merely
to
make
this
low
state
comfortable
and
that
higher
state
to
be
forgotten
there
is
actually
no
place
in
this
village
for
a
work
of
fine
art
if
any
had
come
down
to
us
to
stand
for
our
lives
our
houses
and
streets
furnish
no
proper
pedestal
for
it
there
is
not
a
nail
to
hang
a
picture
on
nor
a
shelf
to
receive
the
bust
of
a
hero
or
a
saint
when
i
consider
how
our
houses
are
built
and
paid
for
or
not
paid
for
and
their
internal
economy
managed
and
sustained
i
wonder
that
the
floor
does
not
give
way
under
the
visitor
while
he
is
admiring
the
gewgaws
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
let
him
through
into
the
cellar
to
some
solid
and
honest
though
earthy
foundation
i
cannot
but
perceive
that
this
so
called
rich
and
refined
life
is
a
thing
jumped
at
and
i
do
not
get
on
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
fine
arts
which
adorn
it
my
attention
being
wholly
occupied
with
the
jump
for
i
remember
that
the
greatest
genuine
leap
due
to
human
muscles
alone
on
record
is
that
of
certain
wandering
arabs
who
are
said
to
have
cleared
twenty
five
feet
on
level
ground
without
factitious
support
man
is
sure
to
come
to
earth
again
beyond
that
distance
the
first
question
which
i
am
tempted
to
put
to
the
proprietor
of
such
great
impropriety
is
who
bolsters
you
are
you
one
of
the
ninety
seven
who
fail
or
the
three
who
succeed
answer
me
these
questions
and
then
perhaps
i
may
look
at
your
bawbles
and
find
them
ornamental
the
cart
before
the
horse
is
neither
beautiful
nor
useful
before
we
can
adorn
our
houses
with
beautiful
objects
the
walls
must
be
stripped
and
our
lives
must
be
stripped
and
beautiful
housekeeping
and
beautiful
living
be
laid
for
a
foundation
now
a
taste
for
the
beautiful
is
most
cultivated
out
of
doors
where
there
is
no
house
and
no
housekeeper
old
johnson
in
his
wonder
working
providence
speaking
of
the
first
settlers
of
this
town
with
whom
he
was
contemporary
tells
us
that
they
burrow
themselves
in
the
earth
for
their
first
shelter
under
some
hillside
and
casting
the
soil
aloft
upon
timber
they
make
a
smoky
fire
against
the
earth
at
the
highest
side
they
did
not
provide
them
houses
says
he
till
the
earth
by
the
lord
s
blessing
brought
forth
bread
to
feed
them
and
the
first
year
s
crop
was
so
light
that
they
were
forced
to
cut
their
bread
very
thin
for
a
long
season
the
secretary
of
the
province
of
new
netherland
writing
in
dutch
in
1650
for
the
information
of
those
who
wished
to
take
up
land
there
states
more
particularly
that
those
in
new
netherland
and
especially
in
new
england
who
have
no
means
to
build
farmhouses
at
first
according
to
their
wishes
dig
a
square
pit
in
the
ground
cellar
fashion
six
or
seven
feet
deep
as
long
and
as
broad
as
they
think
proper
case
the
earth
inside
with
wood
all
round
the
wall
and
line
the
wood
with
the
bark
of
trees
or
something
else
to
prevent
the
caving
in
of
the
earth
floor
this

with
plank
and
wainscot
it
overhead
for
a
ceiling
raise
a
roof
of
spars
clear
up
and
cover
the
spars
with
bark
or
green
sods
so
that
they
can
live
dry
and
warm
in
these
houses
with
their
entire
families
for
two
three
and
four
years
it
being
understood
that
partitions
are
run
through
those
cellars
which
are
adapted
to
the
size
of
the
family
the
wealthy
and
principal
men
in
new
england
in
the
beginning
of
the
colonies
commenced
their
first
dwelling
houses
in
this
fashion
for
two
reasons
firstly
in
order
not
to
waste
time
in
building
and
not
to
want
food
the
next
season
secondly
in
order
not
to
discourage
poor
laboring
people
whom
they
brought
over
in
numbers
from
fatherland
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
years
when
the
country
became
adapted
to
agriculture
they
built
themselves
handsome
houses
spending
on
them
several
thousands
in
this
course
which
our
ancestors
took
there
was
a
show
of
prudence
at
least
as
if
their
principle
were
to
satisfy
the
more
pressing
wants
first
but
are
the
more
pressing
wants
satisfied
now
when
i
think
of
acquiring
for
myself
one
of
our
luxurious
dwellings
i
am
deterred
for
so
to
speak
the
country
is
not
yet
adapted
to
human
culture
and
we
are
still
forced
to
cut
our
spiritual
bread
far
thinner
than
our
forefathers
did
their
wheaten
not
that
all
architectural
ornament
is
to
be
neglected
even
in
the
rudest
periods
but
let
our
houses
first
be
lined
with
beauty
where
they
come
in
contact
with
our
lives
like
the
tenement
of
the
shellfish
and
not
overlaid
with
it
but
alas
i
have
been
inside
one
or
two
of
them
and
know
what
they
are
lined
with
though
we
are
not
so
degenerate
but
that
we
might
possibly
live
in
a
cave
or
a
wigwam
or
wear
skins
today
it
certainly
is
better
to
accept
the
advantages
though
so
dearly
bought
which
the
invention
and
industry
of
mankind
offer
in
such
a
neighborhood
as
this
boards
and
shingles
lime
and
bricks
are
cheaper
and
more
easily
obtained
than
suitable
caves
or
whole
logs
or
bark
in
sufficient
quantities
or
even
well
tempered
clay
or
flat
stones
i
speak
understandingly
on
this
subject
for
i
have
made
myself
acquainted
with
it
both
theoretically
and
practically
with
a
little
more
wit
we
might
use
these
materials
so
as
to
become
richer
than
the
richest
now
are
and
make
our
civilization
a
blessing
the
civilized
man
is
a
more
experienced
and
wiser
savage
but
to
make
haste
to
my
own
experiment
near
the
end
of
march
1845
i
borrowed
an
axe
and
went
down
to
the
woods
by
walden
pond
nearest
to
where
i
intended
to
build
my
house
and
began
to
cut
down
some
tall
arrowy
white
pines
still
in
their
youth
for
timber
it
is
difficult
to
begin
without
borrowing
but
perhaps
it
is
the
most
generous
course
thus
to
permit
your
fellow
men
to
have
an
interest
in
your
enterprise
the
owner
of
the
axe
as
he
released
his
hold
on
it
said
that
it
was
the
apple
of
his
eye
but
i
returned
it
sharper
than
i
received
it
it
was
a
pleasant
hillside
where
i
worked
covered
with
pine
woods
through
which
i
looked
out
on
the
pond
and
a
small
open
field
in
the
woods
where
pines
and
hickories
were
springing
up
the
ice
in
the
pond
was
not
yet
dissolved
though
there
were
some
open
spaces
and
it
was
all
dark
colored
and
saturated
with
water
there
were
some
slight
flurries
of
snow
during
the
days
that
i
worked
there
but
for
the
most
part
when
i
came
out
on
to
the
railroad
on
my
way
home
its
yellow
sand
heap
stretched
away
gleaming
in
the
hazy
atmosphere
and
the
rails
shone
in
the
spring
sun
and
i
heard
the
lark
and
pewee
and
other
birds
already
come
to
commence
another
year
with
us
they
were
pleasant
spring
days
in
which
the
winter
of
man
s
discontent
was
thawing
as
well
as
the
earth
and
the
life
that
had
lain
torpid
began
to
stretch
itself
one
day
when
my
axe
had
come
off
and
i
had
cut
a
green
hickory
for
a
wedge
driving
it
with
a
stone
and
had
placed
the
whole
to
soak
in
a
pond
hole
in
order
to
swell
the
wood
i
saw
a
striped
snake
run
into
the
water
and
he
lay
on
the
bottom
apparently
without
inconvenience
as
long
as
i
stayed
there
or
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
perhaps
because
he
had
not
yet
fairly
come
out
of
the
torpid
state
it
appeared
to
me
that
for
a
like
reason
men
remain
in
their
present
low
and
primitive
condition
but
if
they
should
feel
the
influence
of
the
spring
of
springs
arousing
them
they
would
of
necessity
rise
to
a
higher
and
more
ethereal
life
i
had
previously
seen
the
snakes
in
frosty
mornings
in
my
path
with
portions
of
their
bodies
still
numb
and
inflexible
waiting
for
the
sun
to
thaw
them
on
the
1st
of
april
it
rained
and
melted
the
ice
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
which
was
very
foggy
i
heard
a
stray
goose
groping
about
over
the
pond
and
cackling
as
if
lost
or
like
the
spirit
of
the
fog
so
i
went
on
for
some
days
cutting
and
hewing
timber
and
also
studs
and
rafters
all
with
my
narrow
axe
not
having
many
communicable
or
scholar
like
thoughts
singing
to
myself
men
say
they
know
many
things
but
lo
they
have
taken
wings
the
arts
and
sciences
and
a
thousand
appliances
the
wind
that
blows
is
all
that
any
body
knows
i
hewed
the
main
timbers
six
inches
square
most
of
the
studs
on
two
sides
only
and
the
rafters
and
floor
timbers
on
one
side
leaving
the
rest
of
the
bark
on
so
that
they
were
just
as
straight
and
much
stronger
than
sawed
ones
each
stick
was
carefully
mortised
or
tenoned
by
its
stump
for
i
had
borrowed
other
tools
by
this
time
my
days
in
the
woods
were
not
very
long
ones
yet
i
usually
carried
my
dinner
of
bread
and
butter
and
read
the
newspaper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
at
noon
sitting
amid
the
green
pine
boughs
which
i
had
cut
off
and
to
my
bread
was
imparted
some
of
their
fragrance
for
my
hands
were
covered
with
a
thick
coat
of
pitch
before
i
had
done
i
was
more
the
friend
than
the
foe
of
the
pine
tree
though
i
had
cut
down
some
of
them
having
become
better
acquainted
with
it
sometimes
a
rambler
in
the
wood
was
attracted
by
the
sound
of
my
axe
and
we
chatted
pleasantly
over
the
chips
which
i
had
made
by
the
middle
of
april
for
i
made
no
haste
in
my
work
but
rather
made
the
most
of
it
my
house
was
framed
and
ready
for
the
raising
i
had
already
bought
the
shanty
of
james
collins
an
irishman
who
worked
on
the
fitchburg
railroad
for
boards
james
collins
shanty
was
considered
an
uncommonly
fine
one
when
i
called
to
see
it
he
was
not
at
home
i
walked
about
the
outside
at
first
unobserved
from
within
the
window
was
so
deep
and
high
it
was
of
small
dimensions
with
a
peaked
cottage
roof
and
not
much
else
to
be
seen
the
dirt
being
raised
five
feet
all
around
as
if
it
were
a
compost
heap
the
roof
was
the
soundest
part
though
a
good
deal
warped
and
made
brittle
by
the
sun
doorsill
there
was
none
but
a
perennial
passage
for
the
hens
under
the
door
board
mrs
c
came
to
the
door
and
asked
me
to
view
it
from
the
inside
the
hens
were
driven
in
by
my
approach
it
was
dark
and
had
a
dirt
floor
for
the
most
part
dank
clammy
and
aguish
only
here
a
board
and
there
a
board
which
would
not
bear
removal
she
lighted
a
lamp
to
show
me
the
inside
of
the
roof
and
the
walls
and
also
that
the
board
floor
extended
under
the
bed
warning
me
not
to
step
into
the
cellar
a
sort
of
dust
hole
two
feet
deep
in
her
own
words
they
were
good
boards
overhead
good
boards
all
around
and
a
good
window
of
two
whole
squares
originally
only
the
cat
had
passed
out
that
way
lately
there
was
a
stove
a
bed
and
a
place
to
sit
an
infant
in
the
house
where
it
was
born
a
silk
parasol
gilt
framed
looking
glass
and
a
patent
new
coffee
mill
nailed
to
an
oak
sapling
all
told
the
bargain
was
soon
concluded
for
james
had
in
the
meanwhile
returned
i
to
pay
four
dollars
and
twenty
five
cents
tonight
he
to
vacate
at
five
tomorrow
morning
selling
to
nobody
else
meanwhile
i
to
take
possession
at
six
it
were
well
he
said
to
be
there
early
and
anticipate
certain
indistinct
but
wholly
unjust
claims
on
the
score
of
ground
rent
and
fuel
this
he
assured
me
was
the
only
encumbrance
at
six
i
passed
him
and
his
family
on
the
road
one
large
bundle
held
their
all
bed
coffee
mill
looking
glass
hens
all
but
the
cat
she
took
to
the
woods
and
became
a
wild
cat
and
as
i
learned
afterward
trod
in
a
trap
set
for
woodchucks
and
so
became
a
dead
cat
at
last
i
took
down
this
dwelling
the
same
morning
drawing
the
nails
and
removed
it
to
the
pond
side
by
small
cartloads
spreading
the
boards
on
the
grass
there
to
bleach
and
warp
back
again
in
the
sun
one
early
thrush
gave
me
a
note
or
two
as
i
drove
along
the
woodland
path
i
was
informed
treacherously
by
a
young
patrick
that
neighbor
seeley
an
irishman
in
the
intervals
of
the
carting
transferred
the
still
tolerable
straight
and
drivable
nails
staples
and
spikes
to
his
pocket
and
then
stood
when
i
came
back
to
pass
the
time
of
day
and
look
freshly
up
unconcerned
with
spring
thoughts
at
the
devastation
there
being
a
dearth
of
work
as
he
said
he
was
there
to
represent
spectatordom
and
help
make
this
seemingly
insignificant
event
one
with
the
removal
of
the
gods
of
troy
i
dug
my
cellar
in
the
side
of
a
hill
sloping
to
the
south
where
a
woodchuck
had
formerly
dug
his
burrow
down
through
sumach
and
blackberry
roots
and
the
lowest
stain
of
vegetation
six
feet
square
by
seven
deep
to
a
fine
sand
where
potatoes
would
not
freeze
in
any
winter
the
sides
were
left
shelving
and
not
stoned
but
the
sun
having
never
shone
on
them
the
sand
still
keeps
its
place
it
was
but
two
hours
work
i
took
particular
pleasure
in
this
breaking
of
ground
for
in
almost
all
latitudes
men
dig
into
the
earth
for
an
equable
temperature
under
the
most
splendid
house
in
the
city
is
still
to
be
found
the
cellar
where
they
store
their
roots
as
of
old
and
long
after
the
superstructure
has
disappeared
posterity
remark
its
dent
in
the
earth
the
house
is
still
but
a
sort
of
porch
at
the
entrance
of
a
burrow
at
length
in
the
beginning
of
may
with
the
help
of
some
of
my
acquaintances
rather
to
improve
so
good
an
occasion
for
neighborliness
than
from
any
necessity
i
set
up
the
frame
of
my
house
no
man
was
ever
more
honored
in
the
character
of
his
raisers
than
i
they
are
destined
i
trust
to
assist
at
the
raising
of
loftier
structures
one
day
i
began
to
occupy
my
house
on
the
4th
of
july
as
soon
as
it
was
boarded
and
roofed
for
the
boards
were
carefully
feather
edged
and
lapped
so
that
it
was
perfectly
impervious
to
rain
but
before
boarding
i
laid
the
foundation
of
a
chimney
at
one
end
bringing
two
cartloads
of
stones
up
the
hill
from
the
pond
in
my
arms
i
built
the
chimney
after
my
hoeing
in
the
fall
before
a
fire
became
necessary
for
warmth
doing
my
cooking
in
the
meanwhile
out
of
doors
on
the
ground
early
in
the
morning
which
mode
i
still
think
is
in
some
respects
more
convenient
and
agreeable
than
the
usual
one
when
it
stormed
before
my
bread
was
baked
i
fixed
a
few
boards
over
the
fire
and
sat
under
them
to
watch
my
loaf
and
passed
some
pleasant
hours
in
that
way
in
those
days
when
my
hands
were
much
employed
i
read
but
little
but
the
least
scraps
of
paper
which
lay
on
the
ground
my
holder
or
tablecloth
afforded
me
as
much
entertainment
in
fact
answered
the
same
purpose
as
the
iliad
*
*
*
*
*
it
would
be
worth
the
while
to
build
still
more
deliberately
than
i
did
considering
for
instance
what
foundation
a
door
a
window
a
cellar
a
garret
have
in
the
nature
of
man
and
perchance
never
raising
any
superstructure
until
we
found
a
better
reason
for
it
than
our
temporal
necessities
even
there
is
some
of
the
same
fitness
in
a
man
s
building
his
own
house
that
there
is
in
a
bird
s
building
its
own
nest
who
knows
but
if
men
constructed
their
dwellings
with
their
own
hands
and
provided
food
for
themselves
and
families
simply
and
honestly
enough
the
poetic
faculty
would
be
universally
developed
as
birds
universally
sing
when
they
are
so
engaged
but
alas
we
do
like
cowbirds
and
cuckoos
which
lay
their
eggs
in
nests
which
other
birds
have
built
and
cheer
no
traveller
with
their
chattering
and
unmusical
notes
shall
we
forever
resign
the
pleasure
of
construction
to
the
carpenter
what
does
architecture
amount
to
in
the
experience
of
the
mass
of
men
i
never
in
all
my
walks
came
across
a
man
engaged
in
so
simple
and
natural
an
occupation
as
building
his
house
we
belong
to
the
community
it
is
not
the
tailor
alone
who
is
the
ninth
part
of
a
man
it
is
as
much
the
preacher
and
the
merchant
and
the
farmer
where
is
this
division
of
labor
to
end
and
what
object
does
it
finally
serve
no
doubt
another
may
also
think
for
me
but
it
is
not
therefore
desirable
that
he
should
do
so
to
the
exclusion
of
my
thinking
for
myself
true
there
are
architects
so
called
in
this
country
and
i
have
heard
of
one
at
least
possessed
with
the
idea
of
making
architectural
ornaments
have
a
core
of
truth
a
necessity
and
hence
a
beauty
as
if
it
were
a
revelation
to
him
all
very
well
perhaps
from
his
point
of
view
but
only
a
little
better
than
the
common
dilettantism
a
sentimental
reformer
in
architecture
he
began
at
the
cornice
not
at
the
foundation
it
was
only
how
to
put
a
core
of
truth
within
the
ornaments
that
every
sugarplum
in
fact
might
have
an
almond
or
caraway
seed
in
it
though
i
hold
that
almonds
are
most
wholesome
without
the
sugar
and
not
how
the
inhabitant
the
indweller
might
build
truly
within
and
without
and
let
the
ornaments
take
care
of
themselves
what
reasonable
man
ever
supposed
that
ornaments
were
something
outward
and
in
the
skin
merely
that
the
tortoise
got
his
spotted
shell
or
the
shell
fish
its
mother
o
pearl
tints
by
such
a
contract
as
the
inhabitants
of
broadway
their
trinity
church
but
a
man
has
no
more
to
do
with
the
style
of
architecture
of
his
house
than
a
tortoise
with
that
of
its
shell
nor
need
the
soldier
be
so
idle
as
to
try
to
paint
the
precise
color
of
his
virtue
on
his
standard
the
enemy
will
find
it
out
he
may
turn
pale
when
the
trial
comes
this
man
seemed
to
me
to
lean
over
the
cornice
and
timidly
whisper
his
half
truth
to
the
rude
occupants
who
really
knew
it
better
than
he
what
of
architectural
beauty
i
now
see
i
know
has
gradually
grown
from
within
outward
out
of
the
necessities
and
character
of
the
indweller
who
is
the
only
builder
out
of
some
unconscious
truthfulness
and
nobleness
without
ever
a
thought
for
the
appearance
and
whatever
additional
beauty
of
this
kind
is
destined
to
be
produced
will
be
preceded
by
a
like
unconscious
beauty
of
life
the
most
interesting
dwellings
in
this
country
as
the
painter
knows
are
the
most
unpretending
humble
log
huts
and
cottages
of
the
poor
commonly
it
is
the
life
of
the
inhabitants
whose
shells
they
are
and
not
any
peculiarity
in
their
surfaces
merely
which
makes
them
picturesque
and
equally
interesting
will
be
the
citizen
s
suburban
box
when
his
life
shall
be
as
simple
and
as
agreeable
to
the
imagination
and
there
is
as
little
straining
after
effect
in
the
style
of
his
dwelling
a
great
proportion
of
architectural
ornaments
are
literally
hollow
and
a
september
gale
would
strip
them
off
like
borrowed
plumes
without
injury
to
the
substantials
they
can
do
without
architecture
who
have
no
olives
nor
wines
in
the
cellar
what
if
an
equal
ado
were
made
about
the
ornaments
of
style
in
literature
and
the
architects
of
our
bibles
spent
as
much
time
about
their
cornices
as
the
architects
of
our
churches
do
so
are
made
the
belles
lettres
and
the
beaux
arts
and
their
professors
much
it
concerns
a
man
forsooth
how
a
few
sticks
are
slanted
over
him
or
under
him
and
what
colors
are
daubed
upon
his
box
it
would
signify
somewhat
if
in
any
earnest
sense
he
slanted
them
and
daubed
it
but
the
spirit
having
departed
out
of
the
tenant
it
is
of
a
piece
with
constructing
his
own
coffin
the
architecture
of
the
grave
and
carpenter
is
but
another
name
for
coffin
maker
one
man
says
in
his
despair
or
indifference
to
life
take
up
a
handful
of
the
earth
at
your
feet
and
paint
your
house
that
color
is
he
thinking
of
his
last
and
narrow
house
toss
up
a
copper
for
it
as
well
what
an
abundance
of
leisure
he
must
have
why
do
you
take
up
a
handful
of
dirt
better
paint
your
house
your
own
complexion
let
it
turn
pale
or
blush
for
you
an
enterprise
to
improve
the
style
of
cottage
architecture
when
you
have
got
my
ornaments
ready
i
will
wear
them
before
winter
i
built
a
chimney
and
shingled
the
sides
of
my
house
which
were
already
impervious
to
rain
with
imperfect
and
sappy
shingles
made
of
the
first
slice
of
the
log
whose
edges
i
was
obliged
to
straighten
with
a
plane
i
have
thus
a
tight
shingled
and
plastered
house
ten
feet
wide

fifteen
long
and
eight

with
a

adjoining
made
chiefly
of
the
stuff
which
was
left
after
building
the
house
i
intend
to
build
me
a
house
which
will
surpass
any
on
the
main
street
in
concord
in
grandeur
and
luxury
as
soon
as
it
pleases
me
as
much
and
will
cost
me
no
more
than
my
present
one
i
thus
found
that
the
student
who
wishes
for
a
shelter
can
obtain
one
for
a
lifetime
at
an
expense
not
greater
than
the
rent
which
he
now
pays
annually
if
i
seem
to
boast
more
than
is
becoming
my
excuse
is
that
i
brag
for
humanity
rather
than
for
myself
and
my
shortcomings
and
inconsistencies
do
not
affect
the
truth
of
my
statement
notwithstanding
much
cant
and
hypocrisy
chaff
which
i
find
it
difficult
to
separate
from
my
wheat
but
for
which
i
am
as
sorry
as
any
man
i
will
breathe
freely
and
stretch
myself
in
this
respect
it
is
such
a
relief
to
both
the
moral
and
physical
system
and
i
am
resolved
that
i
will
not
through
humility
become
the
devil
s
attorney
i
will
endeavor
to
speak
a
good
word
for
the
truth
at
cambridge
college
the
mere
rent
of
a
student
s
room
which
is
only
a
little
larger
than
my
own
is
thirty
dollars
each
year
though
the
corporation
had
the
advantage
of
building
thirty
two
side
by
side
and
under
one
roof
and
the
occupant
suffers
the
inconvenience
of
many
and
noisy
neighbors
and
perhaps
a
residence
in
the
fourth
story
i
cannot
but
think
that
if
we
had
more
true
wisdom
in
these
respects
not
only
less
education
would
be
needed
because
forsooth
more
would
already
have
been
acquired
but
the
pecuniary
expense
of
getting
an
education
would
in
a
great
measure
vanish
those
conveniences
which
the
student
requires
at
cambridge
or
elsewhere
cost
him
or
somebody
else
ten
times
as
great
a
sacrifice
of
life
as
they
would
with
proper
management
on
both
sides
those
things
for
which
the
most
money
is
demanded
are
never
the
things
which
the
student
most
wants
tuition
for
instance
is
an
important
item
in
the
term
bill
while
for
the
far
more
valuable
education
which
he
gets
by
associating
with
the
most
cultivated
of
his
contemporaries
no
charge
is
made
the
mode
of
founding
a
college
is
commonly
to
get
up
a
subscription
of
dollars
and
cents
and
then
following
blindly
the
principles
of
a
division
of
labor
to
its
extreme
a
principle
which
should
never
be
followed
but
with
circumspection
to
call
in
a
contractor
who
makes
this
a
subject
of
speculation
and
he
employs
irishmen
or
other
operatives
actually
to
lay
the
foundations
while
the
students
that
are
to
be
are
said
to
be
fitting
themselves
for
it
and
for
these
oversights
successive
generations
have
to
pay
i
think
that
it
would
be
better
than
this
for
the
students
or
those
who
desire
to
be
benefited
by
it
even
to
lay
the
foundation
themselves
the
student
who
secures
his
coveted
leisure
and
retirement
by
systematically
shirking
any
labor
necessary
to
man
obtains
but
an
ignoble
and
unprofitable
leisure
defrauding
himself
of
the
experience
which
alone
can
make
leisure
fruitful
but
says
one
you
do
not
mean
that
the
students
should
go
to
work
with
their
hands
instead
of
their
heads
i
do
not
mean
that
exactly
but
i
mean
something
which
he
might
think
a
good
deal
like
that
i
mean
that
they
should
not
play
life
or
study
it
merely
while
the
community
supports
them
at
this
expensive
game
but
earnestly
live
it
from
beginning
to
end
how
could
youths
better
learn
to
live
than
by
at
once
trying
the
experiment
of
living
methinks
this
would
exercise
their
minds
as
much
as
mathematics
if
i
wished
a
boy
to
know
something
about
the
arts
and
sciences
for
instance
i
would
not
pursue
the
common
course
which
is
merely
to
send
him
into
the
neighborhood
of
some
professor
where
anything
is
professed
and
practised
but
the
art
of
life
to
survey
the
world
through
a
telescope
or
a
microscope
and
never
with
his
natural
eye
to
study
chemistry
and
not
learn
how
his
bread
is
made
or
mechanics
and
not
learn
how
it
is
earned
to
discover
new
satellites
to
neptune
and
not
detect
the
motes
in
his
eyes
or
to
what
vagabond
he
is
a
satellite
himself
or
to
be
devoured
by
the
monsters
that
swarm
all
around
him
while
contemplating
the
monsters
in
a
drop
of
vinegar
which
would
have
advanced
the
most
at
the
end
of
a
month
the
boy
who
had
made
his
own
jackknife
from
the
ore
which
he
had
dug
and
smelted
reading
as
much
as
would
be
necessary
for
this
or
the
boy
who
had
attended
the
lectures
on
metallurgy
at
the
institute
in
the
meanwhile
and
had
received
a
rodgers
penknife
from
his
father
which
would
be
most
likely
to
cut
his
fingers
to
my
astonishment
i
was
informed
on
leaving
college
that
i
had
studied
navigation
why
if
i
had
taken
one
turn
down
the
harbor
i
should
have
known
more
about
it
even
the
poor
student
studies
and
is
taught
only
political
economy
while
that
economy
of
living
which
is
synonymous
with
philosophy
is
not
even
sincerely
professed
in
our
colleges
the
consequence
is
that
while
he
is
reading
adam
smith
ricardo
and
say
he
runs
his
father
in
debt
irretrievably
as
with
our
colleges
so
with
a
hundred
modern
improvements
there
is
an
illusion
about
them
there
is
not
always
a
positive
advance
the
devil
goes
on
exacting
compound
interest
to
the
last
for
his
early
share
and
numerous
succeeding
investments
in
them
our
inventions
are
wont
to
be
pretty
toys
which
distract
our
attention
from
serious
things
they
are
but
improved
means
to
an
unimproved
end
an
end
which
it
was
already
but
too
easy
to
arrive
at
as
railroads
lead
to
boston
or
new
york
we
are
in
great
haste
to
construct
a
magnetic
telegraph
from
maine
to
texas
but
maine
and
texas
it
may
be
have
nothing
important
to
communicate
either
is
in
such
a
predicament
as
the
man
who
was
earnest
to
be
introduced
to
a
distinguished
deaf
woman
but
when
he
was
presented
and
one
end
of
her
ear
trumpet
was
put
into
his
hand
had
nothing
to
say
as
if
the
main
object
were
to
talk
fast
and
not
to
talk
sensibly
we
are
eager
to
tunnel
under
the
atlantic
and
bring
the
old
world
some
weeks
nearer
to
the
new
but
perchance
the
first
news
that
will
leak
through
into
the
broad
flapping
american
ear
will
be
that
the
princess
adelaide
has
the
whooping
cough
after
all
the
man
whose
horse
trots
a
mile
in
a
minute
does
not
carry
the
most
important
messages
he
is
not
an
evangelist
nor
does
he
come
round
eating
locusts
and
wild
honey
i
doubt
if
flying
childers
ever
carried
a
peck
of
corn
to
mill
one
says
to
me
i
wonder
that
you
do
not
lay
up
money
you
love
to
travel
you
might
take
the
cars
and
go
to
fitchburg
today
and
see
the
country
but
i
am
wiser
than
that
i
have
learned
that
the
swiftest
traveller
is
he
that
goes
afoot
i
say
to
my
friend
suppose
we
try
who
will
get
there
first
the
distance
is
thirty
miles
the
fare
ninety
cents
that
is
almost
a
day
s
wages
i
remember
when
wages
were
sixty
cents
a
day
for
laborers
on
this
very
road
well
i
start
now
on
foot
and
get
there
before
night
i
have
travelled
at
that
rate
by
the
week
together
you
will
in
the
meanwhile
have
earned
your
fare
and
arrive
there
some
time
tomorrow
or
possibly
this
evening
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
get
a
job
in
season
instead
of
going
to
fitchburg
you
will
be
working
here
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
so
if
the
railroad
reached
round
the
world
i
think
that
i
should
keep
ahead
of
you
and
as
for
seeing
the
country
and
getting
experience
of
that
kind
i
should
have
to
cut
your
acquaintance
altogether
such
is
the
universal
law
which
no
man
can
ever
outwit
and
with
regard
to
the
railroad
even
we
may
say
it
is
as
broad
as
it
is
long
to
make
a
railroad
round
the
world
available
to
all
mankind
is
equivalent
to
grading
the
whole
surface
of
the
planet
men
have
an
indistinct
notion
that
if
they
keep
up
this
activity
of
joint
stocks
and
spades
long
enough
all
will
at
length
ride
somewhere
in
next
to
no
time
and
for
nothing
but
though
a
crowd
rushes
to
the
depot
and
the
conductor
shouts
all
aboard
when
the
smoke
is
blown
away
and
the
vapor
condensed
it
will
be
perceived
that
a
few
are
riding
but
the
rest
are
run
over
and
it
will
be
called
and
will
be
a
melancholy
accident
no
doubt
they
can
ride
at
last
who
shall
have
earned
their
fare
that
is
if
they
survive
so
long
but
they
will
probably
have
lost
their
elasticity
and
desire
to
travel
by
that
time
this
spending
of
the
best
part
of
one
s
life
earning
money
in
order
to
enjoy
a
questionable
liberty
during
the
least
valuable
part
of
it
reminds
me
of
the
englishman
who
went
to
india
to
make
a
fortune
first
in
order
that
he
might
return
to
england
and
live
the
life
of
a
poet
he
should
have
gone
up
garret
at
once
what
exclaim
a
million
irishmen
starting
up
from
all
the
shanties
in
the
land
is
not
this
railroad
which
we
have
built
a
good
thing
yes
i
answer
comparatively
good
that
is
you
might
have
done
worse
but
i
wish
as
you
are
brothers
of
mine
that
you
could
have
spent
your
time
better
than
digging
in
this
dirt

before
i
finished
my
house
wishing
to
earn
ten
or
twelve
dollars
by
some
honest
and
agreeable
method
in
order
to
meet
my
unusual
expenses
i
planted
about
two
acres
and
a
half
of
light
and
sandy
soil
near
it
chiefly
with
beans
but
also
a
small
part
with
potatoes
corn
peas
and
turnips
the
whole
lot
contains
eleven
acres
mostly
growing
up
to
pines
and
hickories
and
was
sold
the
preceding
season
for
eight
dollars
and
eight
cents
an
acre
one
farmer
said
that
it
was
good
for
nothing
but
to
raise
cheeping
squirrels
on
i
put
no
manure
whatever
on
this
land
not
being
the
owner
but
merely
a
squatter
and
not
expecting
to
cultivate
so
much
again
and
i
did
not
quite
hoe
it
all
once
i
got
out
several
cords
of
stumps
in
plowing
which
supplied
me
with
fuel
for
a
long
time
and
left
small
circles
of
virgin
mould
easily
distinguishable
through
the
summer
by
the
greater
luxuriance
of
the
beans
there
the
dead
and
for
the
most
part
unmerchantable
wood
behind
my
house
and
the
driftwood
from
the
pond
have
supplied
the
remainder
of
my
fuel
i
was
obliged
to
hire
a
team
and
a
man
for
the
plowing
though
i
held
the
plow
myself
my
farm
outgoes
for
the
first
season
were
for
implements
seed
work
etc
$14
72
1
2
the
seed
corn
was
given
me
this
never
costs
anything
to
speak
of
unless
you
plant
more
than
enough
i
got
twelve
bushels
of
beans
and
eighteen
bushels
of
potatoes
beside
some
peas
and
sweet
corn
the
yellow
corn
and
turnips
were
too
late
to
come
to
anything
my
whole
income
from
the
farm
was
$
23
44
deducting
the
outgoes
14

there
are
left
$
8

beside
produce
consumed
and
on
hand
at
the
time
this
estimate
was
made
of
the
value
of
$4
50
the
amount
on
hand
much
more
than
balancing
a
little
grass
which
i
did
not
raise
all
things
considered
that
is
considering
the
importance
of
a
man
s
soul
and
of
today
notwithstanding
the
short
time
occupied
by
my
experiment
nay
partly
even
because
of
its
transient
character
i
believe
that
that
was
doing
better
than
any
farmer
in
concord
did
that
year
the
next
year
i
did
better
still
for
i
spaded
up
all
the
land
which
i
required
about
a
third
of
an
acre
and
i
learned
from
the
experience
of
both
years
not
being
in
the
least
awed
by
many
celebrated
works
on
husbandry
arthur
young
among
the
rest
that
if
one
would
live
simply
and
eat
only
the
crop
which
he
raised
and
raise
no
more
than
he
ate
and
not
exchange
it
for
an
insufficient
quantity
of
more
luxurious
and
expensive
things
he
would
need
to
cultivate
only
a
few
rods
of
ground
and
that
it
would
be
cheaper
to
spade
up
that
than
to
use
oxen
to
plow
it
and
to
select
a
fresh
spot
from
time
to
time
than
to
manure
the
old
and
he
could
do
all
his
necessary
farm
work
as
it
were
with
his
left
hand
at
odd
hours
in
the
summer
and
thus
he
would
not
be
tied
to
an
ox
or
horse
or
cow
or
pig
as
at
present
i
desire
to
speak
impartially
on
this
point
and
as
one
not
interested
in
the
success
or
failure
of
the
present
economical
and
social
arrangements
i
was
more
independent
than
any
farmer
in
concord
for
i
was
not
anchored
to
a
house
or
farm
but
could
follow
the
bent
of
my
genius
which
is
a
very
crooked
one
every
moment
beside
being
better
off
than
they
already
if
my
house
had
been
burned
or
my
crops
had
failed
i
should
have
been
nearly
as
well
off
as
before
i
am
wont
to
think
that
men
are
not
so
much
the
keepers
of
herds
as
herds
are
the
keepers
of
men
the
former
are
so
much
the
freer
men
and
oxen
exchange
work
but
if
we
consider
necessary
work
only
the
oxen
will
be
seen
to
have
greatly
the
advantage
their
farm
is
so
much
the
larger
man
does
some
of
his
part
of
the
exchange
work
in
his
six
weeks
of
haying
and
it
is
no
boy
s
play
certainly
no
nation
that
lived
simply
in
all
respects
that
is
no
nation
of
philosophers
would
commit
so
great
a
blunder
as
to
use
the
labor
of
animals
true
there
never
was
and
is
not
likely
soon
to
be
a
nation
of
philosophers
nor
am
i
certain
it
is
desirable
that
there
should
be
however
i
should
never
have
broken
a
horse
or
bull
and
taken
him
to
board
for
any
work
he
might
do
for
me
for
fear
i
should
become
a
horseman
or
a
herdsman
merely
and
if
society
seems
to
be
the
gainer
by
so
doing
are
we
certain
that
what
is
one
man
s
gain
is
not
another
s
loss
and
that
the
stable
boy
has
equal
cause
with
his
master
to
be
satisfied
granted
that
some
public
works
would
not
have
been
constructed
without
this
aid
and
let
man
share
the
glory
of
such
with
the
ox
and
horse
does
it
follow
that
he
could
not
have
accomplished
works
yet
more
worthy
of
himself
in
that
case
when
men
begin
to
do
not
merely
unnecessary
or
artistic
but
luxurious
and
idle
work
with
their
assistance
it
is
inevitable
that
a
few
do
all
the
exchange
work
with
the
oxen
or
in
other
words
become
the
slaves
of
the
strongest
man
thus
not
only
works
for
the
animal
within
him
but
for
a
symbol
of
this
he
works
for
the
animal
without
him
though
we
have
many
substantial
houses
of
brick
or
stone
the
prosperity
of
the
farmer
is
still
measured
by
the
degree
to
which
the
barn
overshadows
the
house
this
town
is
said
to
have
the
largest
houses
for
oxen
cows
and
horses
hereabouts
and
it
is
not
behindhand
in
its
public
buildings
but
there
are
very
few
halls
for
free
worship
or
free
speech
in
this
county
it
should
not
be
by
their
architecture
but
why
not
even
by
their
power
of
abstract
thought
that
nations
should
seek
to
commemorate
themselves
how
much
more
admirable
the
bhagvat
geeta
than
all
the
ruins
of
the
east
towers
and
temples
are
the
luxury
of
princes
a
simple
and
independent
mind
does
not
toil
at
the
bidding
of
any
prince
genius
is
not
a
retainer
to
any
emperor
nor
is
its
material
silver
or
gold
or
marble
except
to
a
trifling
extent
to
what
end
pray
is
so
much
stone
hammered
in
arcadia
when
i
was
there
i
did
not
see
any
hammering
stone
nations
are
possessed
with
an
insane
ambition
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
themselves
by
the
amount
of
hammered
stone
they
leave
what
if
equal
pains
were
taken
to
smooth
and
polish
their
manners
one
piece
of
good
sense
would
be
more
memorable
than
a
monument
as
high
as
the
moon
i
love
better
to
see
stones
in
place
the
grandeur
of
thebes
was
a
vulgar
grandeur
more
sensible
is
a
rod
of
stone
wall
that
bounds
an
honest
man
s
field
than
a
hundred
gated
thebes
that
has
wandered
farther
from
the
true
end
of
life
the
religion
and
civilization
which
are
barbaric
and
heathenish
build
splendid
temples
but
what
you
might
call
christianity
does
not
most
of
the
stone
a
nation
hammers
goes
toward
its
tomb
only
it
buries
itself
alive
as
for
the
pyramids
there
is
nothing
to
wonder
at
in
them
so
much
as
the
fact
that
so
many
men
could
be
found
degraded
enough
to
spend
their
lives
constructing
a
tomb
for
some
ambitious
booby
whom
it
would
have
been
wiser
and
manlier
to
have
drowned
in
the
nile
and
then
given
his
body
to
the
dogs
i
might
possibly
invent
some
excuse
for
them
and
him
but
i
have
no
time
for
it
as
for
the
religion
and
love
of
art
of
the
builders
it
is
much
the
same
all
the
world
over
whether
the
building
be
an
egyptian
temple
or
the
united
states
bank
it
costs
more
than
it
comes
to
the
mainspring
is
vanity
assisted
by
the
love
of
garlic
and
bread
and
butter
mr
balcom
a
promising
young
architect
designs
it
on
the
back
of
his
vitruvius
with
hard
pencil
and
ruler
and
the
job
is
let
out
to
dobson
sons
stonecutters
when
the
thirty
centuries
begin
to
look
down
on
it
mankind
begin
to
look
up
at
it
as
for
your
high
towers
and
monuments
there
was
a
crazy
fellow
once
in
this
town
who
undertook
to
dig
through
to
china
and
he
got
so
far
that
as
he
said
he
heard
the
chinese
pots
and
kettles
rattle
but
i
think
that
i
shall
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
admire
the
hole
which
he
made
many
are
concerned
about
the
monuments
of
the
west
and
the
east
to
know
who
built
them
for
my
part
i
should
like
to
know
who
in
those
days
did
not
build
them
who
were
above
such
trifling
but
to
proceed
with
my
statistics
by
surveying

were
equally
guilty
with

and
that
their

would
look
no

the
next

i
sometimes
caught
a
mess
of
fish
for
my
dinner
and
once
i
went
so
far
as
to
slaughter
a
woodchuck
which
ravaged
my
bean
field
effect
his
transmigration
as
a
tartar
would
say
and
devour
him
partly
for
experiment
s
sake
but
though
it
afforded
me
a
momentary
enjoyment
notwithstanding
a
musky
flavor
i
saw
that
the
longest
use
would
not
make
that
a
good
practice
however
it
might
seem
to
have
your
woodchucks
ready

on
the
one
side
this
being
very
nearly
the
means
with
which
i
started
and
the
measure
of
expenses
to
be
incurred
and
on
the
other
beside
the
leisure
and
independence
and
health
thus
secured
a
comfortable
house
for
me
as
long
as
i
choose
to
occupy
it
these
statistics
however
accidental
and
therefore
uninstructive
they
may
appear
as
they
have
a
certain
completeness
have
a
certain
value
also
nothing
was
given
me
of
which
i
have
not
rendered
some
account
it
appears
from
the
above
estimate
that
my
food
alone
cost
me
in
money
about
twenty
seven
cents
a
week
it
was
for
nearly
two
years
after
this
rye
and
indian
meal
without
yeast
potatoes
rice
a
very
little
salt
pork
molasses
and
salt
and
my
drink
water
it
was
fit
that
i
should
live
on
rice
mainly
who
love
so
well
the
philosophy
of
india
to
meet
the
objections
of
some
inveterate
cavillers
i
may
as
well
state
that
if
i
dined
out
occasionally
as
i
always
had
done
and
i
trust
shall
have
opportunities
to
do
again
it
was
frequently
to
the
detriment
of
my
domestic
arrangements
but
the
dining
out
being
as
i
have
stated
a
constant
element
does
not
in
the
least
affect
a
comparative
statement
like
this
i
learned
from
my
two
years
experience
that
it
would
cost
incredibly
little
trouble
to
obtain
one
s
necessary
food
even
in
this
latitude
that
a
man
may
use
as
simple
a
diet
as
the
animals
and
yet
retain
health
and
strength
i
have
made
a
satisfactory
dinner
satisfactory
on
several
accounts
simply
off
a
dish
of
purslane
portulaca
oleracea
which
i
gathered
in
my
cornfield
boiled
and
salted
i
give
the
latin
on
account
of
the
savoriness
of
the
trivial
name
and
pray
what
more
can
a
reasonable
man
desire
in
peaceful
times
in
ordinary
noons
than
a
sufficient
number
of
ears
of
green
sweet
corn
boiled
with
the
addition
of
salt
even
the
little
variety
which
i
used
was
a
yielding
to
the
demands
of
appetite
and
not
of
health
yet
men
have
come
to
such
a
pass
that
they
frequently
starve
not
for
want
of
necessaries
but
for
want
of
luxuries
and
i
know
a
good
woman
who
thinks
that
her
son
lost
his
life
because
he
took
to
drinking
water
only
the
reader
will
perceive
that
i
am
treating
the
subject
rather
from
an
economic
than
a
dietetic
point
of
view
and
he
will
not
venture
to
put
my
abstemiousness
to
the
test
unless
he
has
a
well
stocked
larder
bread
i
at
first
made
of
pure
indian
meal
and
salt
genuine
hoe
cakes
which
i
baked
before
my
fire
out
of
doors
on
a
shingle
or
the
end
of
a
stick
of
timber
sawed
off
in
building
my
house
but
it
was
wont
to
get
smoked
and
to
have
a
piny
flavor
i
tried
flour
also
but
have
at
last
found
a
mixture
of
rye
and
indian
meal
most
convenient
and
agreeable
in
cold
weather
it
was
no
little
amusement
to
bake
several
small
loaves
of
this
in
succession
tending
and
turning
them
as
carefully
as
an
egyptian
his
hatching
eggs
they
were
a
real
cereal
fruit
which
i
ripened
and
they
had
to
my
senses
a
fragrance
like
that
of
other
noble
fruits
which
i
kept
in
as
long
as
possible
by
wrapping
them
in
cloths
i
made
a
study
of
the
ancient
and
indispensable
art
of
bread
making
consulting
such
authorities
as
offered
going
back
to
the
primitive
days
and
first
invention
of
the
unleavened
kind
when
from
the
wildness
of
nuts
and
meats
men
first
reached
the
mildness
and
refinement
of
this
diet
and
travelling
gradually
down
in
my
studies
through
that
accidental
souring
of
the
dough
which
it
is
supposed
taught
the
leavening
process
and
through
the
various
fermentations
thereafter
till
i
came
to
good
sweet
wholesome
bread
the
staff
of
life
leaven
which
some
deem
the
soul
of
bread
the
spiritus
which
fills
its
cellular
tissue
which
is
religiously
preserved
like
the
vestal
fire
some
precious
bottleful
i
suppose
first
brought
over
in
the
mayflower
did
the
business
for
america
and
its
influence
is
still
rising
swelling
spreading
in
cerealian
billows
over
the
land
this
seed
i
regularly
and
faithfully
procured
from
the
village
till
at
length
one
morning
i
forgot
the
rules
and
scalded
my
yeast
by
which
accident
i
discovered
that
even
this
was
not
indispensable
for
my
discoveries
were
not
by
the
synthetic
but
analytic
process
and
i
have
gladly
omitted
it
since
though
most
housewives
earnestly
assured
me
that
safe
and
wholesome
bread
without
yeast
might
not
be
and
elderly
people
prophesied
a
speedy
decay
of
the
vital
forces
yet
i
find
it
not
to
be
an
essential
ingredient
and
after
going
without
it
for
a
year
am
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
i
am
glad
to
escape
the
trivialness
of
carrying
a
bottleful
in
my
pocket
which
would
sometimes
pop
and
discharge
its
contents
to
my
discomfiture
it
is
simpler
and
more
respectable
to
omit
it
man
is
an
animal
who
more
than
any
other
can
adapt
himself
to
all
climates
and
circumstances
neither
did
i
put
any
sal
soda
or
other
acid
or
alkali
into
my
bread
it
would
seem
that
i
made
it
according
to
the
recipe
which
marcus
porcius
cato
gave
about
two
centuries
before
christ
panem
depsticium
sic
facito
manus
mortariumque
bene
lavato

which
i
take
to
mean
make
kneaded
bread
thus
wash
your
hands
and
trough
well
put
the
meal
into
the
trough
add
water
gradually
and
knead
it
thoroughly
when
you
have
kneaded
it
well
mould
it
and
bake
it
under
a
cover
that
is
in
a
baking
kettle
not
a
word
about
leaven
but
i
did
not
always
use
this
staff
of
life
at
one
time
owing
to
the
emptiness
of
my
purse
i
saw
none
of
it
for
more
than
a
month
every
new
englander
might
easily
raise
all
his
own
breadstuffs
in
this
land
of
rye
and
indian
corn
and
not
depend
on
distant
and
fluctuating
markets
for
them
yet
so
far
are
we
from
simplicity
and
independence
that
in
concord
fresh
and
sweet
meal
is
rarely
sold
in
the
shops
and
hominy
and
corn
in
a
still
coarser
form
are
hardly
used
by
any
for
the
most
part
the
farmer
gives
to
his
cattle
and
hogs
the
grain
of
his
own
producing
and
buys
flour
which
is
at
least
no
more
wholesome
at
a
greater
cost
at
the
store
i
saw
that
i
could
easily
raise
my
bushel
or
two
of
rye
and
indian
corn
for
the
former
will
grow
on
the
poorest
land
and
the
latter
does
not
require
the
best
and
grind
them
in
a
hand
mill
and
so
do
without
rice
and
pork
and
if
i
must
have
some
concentrated
sweet
i
found
by
experiment
that
i
could
make
a
very
good
molasses
either
of
pumpkins
or
beets
and
i
knew
that
i
needed
only
to
set
out
a
few
maples
to
obtain
it
more
easily
still
and
while
these
were
growing
i
could
use
various
substitutes
beside
those
which
i
have
named
for
as
the
forefathers
sang
we
can
make
liquor
to
sweeten
our
lips
of
pumpkins
and
parsnips
and
walnut
tree
chips
finally
as
for
salt
that
grossest
of
groceries
to
obtain
this
might
be
a
fit
occasion
for
a
visit
to
the
seashore
or
if
i
did
without
it
altogether
i
should
probably
drink
the
less
water
i
do
not
learn
that
the
indians
ever
troubled
themselves
to
go
after
it
thus
i
could
avoid
all
trade
and
barter
so
far
as
my
food
was
concerned
and
having
a
shelter
already
it
would
only
remain
to
get
clothing
and
fuel
the
pantaloons
which
i
now
wear
were
woven
in
a
farmer
s
family
thank
heaven
there
is
so
much
virtue
still
in
man
for
i
think
the
fall
from
the
farmer
to
the
operative
as
great
and
memorable
as
that
from
the
man
to
the
farmer
and
in
a
new
country
fuel
is
an
encumbrance
as
for
a
habitat
if
i
were
not
permitted
still
to
squat
i
might
purchase
one
acre
at
the
same
price
for
which
the
land
i
cultivated
was
sold
namely
eight
dollars
and
eight
cents
but
as
it
was
i
considered
that
i
enhanced
the
value
of
the
land
by
squatting
on
it
there
is
a
certain
class
of
unbelievers
who
sometimes
ask
me
such
questions
as
if
i
think
that
i
can
live
on
vegetable
food
alone
and
to
strike
at
the
root
of
the
matter
at
once
for
the
root
is
faith
i
am
accustomed
to
answer
such
that
i
can
live
on
board
nails
if
they
cannot
understand
that
they
cannot
understand
much
that
i
have
to
say
for
my
part
i
am
glad
to
hear
of
experiments
of
this
kind
being
tried
as
that
a
young
man
tried
for
a
fortnight
to
live
on
hard
raw
corn
on
the
ear
using
his
teeth
for
all
mortar
the
squirrel
tribe
tried
the
same
and
succeeded
the
human
race
is
interested
in
these
experiments
though
a
few
old
women
who
are
incapacitated
for
them
or
who
own
their
thirds
in
mills
may
be
alarmed

my
furniture
part
of
which
i
made
myself
and
the
rest
cost
me
nothing
of
which
i
have
not
rendered
an
account
consisted
of
a
bed
a
table
a
desk
three
chairs
a
looking
glass
three
inches
in

a

of

and

a

and

three
plates
one

one

a

for

a
jug
for

and
a
japanned
lamp
none
is
so
poor
that
he
need
sit
on
a
pumpkin
that
is
shiftlessness
there
is
a
plenty
of
such
chairs
as
i
like
best
in
the
village
garrets
to
be
had
for
taking
them
away
furniture
thank
god
i
can
sit
and
i
can
stand
without
the
aid
of
a
furniture
warehouse
what
man
but
a
philosopher
would
not
be
ashamed
to
see
his
furniture
packed
in
a
cart
and
going
up
country
exposed
to
the
light
of
heaven
and
the
eyes
of
men
a
beggarly
account
of
empty
boxes
that
is
spaulding
s
furniture
i
could
never
tell
from
inspecting
such
a
load
whether
it
belonged
to
a
so
called
rich
man
or
a
poor
one
the
owner
always
seemed
poverty
stricken
indeed
the
more
you
have
of
such
things
the
poorer
you
are
each
load
looks
as
if
it
contained
the
contents
of
a
dozen
shanties
and
if
one
shanty
is
poor
this
is
a
dozen
times
as
poor
pray
for
what
do
we
move
ever
but
to
get
rid
of
our
furniture
our
exuvi
at
last
to
go
from
this
world
to
another
newly
furnished
and
leave
this
to
be
burned
it
is
the
same
as
if
all
these
traps
were
buckled
to
a
man
s
belt
and
he
could
not
move
over
the
rough
country
where
our
lines
are
cast
without
dragging
them
dragging
his
trap
he
was
a
lucky
fox
that
left
his
tail
in
the
trap
the
muskrat
will
gnaw
his
third
leg
off
to
be
free
no
wonder
man
has
lost
his
elasticity
how
often
he
is
at
a
dead
set
sir
if
i
may
be
so
bold
what
do
you
mean
by
a
dead
set
if
you
are
a
seer
whenever
you
meet
a
man
you
will
see
all
that
he
owns
ay
and
much
that
he
pretends
to
disown
behind
him
even
to
his
kitchen
furniture
and
all
the
trumpery
which
he
saves
and
will
not
burn
and
he
will
appear
to
be
harnessed
to
it
and
making
what
headway
he
can
i
think
that
the
man
is
at
a
dead
set
who
has
got
through
a
knot
hole
or
gateway
where
his
sledge
load
of
furniture
cannot
follow
him
i
cannot
but
feel
compassion
when
i
hear
some
trig
compact
looking
man
seemingly
free
all
girded
and
ready
speak
of
his
furniture
as
whether
it
is
insured
or
not
but
what
shall
i
do
with
my
furniture
my
gay
butterfly
is
entangled
in
a
spider
s
web
then
even
those
who
seem
for
a
long
while
not
to
have
any
if
you
inquire
more
narrowly
you
will
find
have
some
stored
in
somebody
s
barn
i
look
upon
england
today
as
an
old
gentleman
who
is
travelling
with
a
great
deal
of
baggage
trumpery
which
has
accumulated
from
long
housekeeping
which
he
has
not
the
courage
to
burn
great
trunk
little
trunk
bandbox
and
bundle
throw
away
the
first
three
at
least
it
would
surpass
the
powers
of
a
well
man
nowadays
to
take
up
his
bed
and
walk
and
i
should
certainly
advise
a
sick
one
to
lay
down
his
bed
and
run
when
i
have
met
an
immigrant
tottering
under
a
bundle
which
contained
his
all
looking
like
an
enormous
wen
which
had
grown
out
of
the
nape
of
his
neck
i
have
pitied
him
not
because
that
was
his
all
but
because
he
had
all
that
to
carry
if
i
have
got
to
drag
my
trap
i
will
take
care
that
it
be
a
light
one
and
do
not
nip
me
in
a
vital
part
but
perchance
it
would
be
wisest
never
to
put
one
s
paw
into
it
i
would
observe
by
the
way
that
it
costs
me
nothing
for
curtains
for
i
have
no
gazers
to
shut
out
but
the
sun
and
moon
and
i
am
willing
that
they
should
look
in
the
moon
will
not
sour
milk
nor
taint
meat
of
mine
nor
will
the
sun
injure
my
furniture
or
fade
my
carpet
and
if
he
is
sometimes
too
warm
a
friend
i
find
it
still
better
economy
to
retreat
behind
some
curtain
which
nature
has
provided
than
to
add
a
single
item
to
the
details
of
housekeeping
a
lady
once
offered
me
a
mat
but
as
i
had
no
room
to
spare
within
the
house
nor
time
to
spare
within
or
without
to
shake
it
i
declined
it
preferring
to
wipe
my
feet
on
the
sod
before
my
door
it
is
best
to
avoid
the
beginnings
of
evil
not
long
since
i
was
present
at
the
auction
of
a
deacon
s
effects
for
his
life
had
not
been
ineffectual
the
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them
as
usual
a
great
proportion
was
trumpery
which
had
begun
to
accumulate
in
his
father
s
day
among
the
rest
was
a
dried
tapeworm
and
now
after
lying
half
a
century
in
his
garret
and
other
dust
holes
these
things
were
not
burned
instead
of
a
bonfire
or
purifying
destruction
of
them
there
was
an
auction
or
increasing
of
them
the
neighbors
eagerly
collected
to
view
them
bought
them
all
and
carefully
transported
them
to
their
garrets
and
dust
holes
to
lie
there
till
their
estates
are
settled
when
they
will
start
again
when
a
man
dies
he
kicks
the
dust
the
customs
of
some
savage
nations
might
perchance
be
profitably
imitated
by
us
for
they
at
least
go
through
the
semblance
of
casting
their
slough
annually
they
have
the
idea
of
the
thing
whether
they
have
the
reality
or
not
would
it
not
be
well
if
we
were
to
celebrate
such
a
busk
or
feast
of
first
fruits
as
bartram
describes
to
have
been
the
custom
of
the
mucclasse
indians
when
a
town
celebrates
the
busk
says
he
having
previously
provided
themselves
with
new
clothes
new
pots
pans
and
other
household
utensils
and
furniture
they
collect
all
their
worn
out
clothes
and
other
despicable
things
sweep
and
cleanse
their
houses
squares
and
the
whole
town
of
their
filth
which
with
all
the
remaining
grain
and
other
old
provisions
they
cast
together
into
one
common
heap
and
consume
it
with
fire
after
having
taken
medicine
and
fasted
for
three
days
all
the
fire
in
the
town
is
extinguished
during
this
fast
they
abstain
from
the
gratification
of
every
appetite
and
passion
whatever
a
general
amnesty
is
proclaimed
all
malefactors
may
return
to
their
town
on
the
fourth
morning
the
high
priest
by
rubbing
dry
wood
together
produces
new
fire
in
the
public
square
from
whence
every
habitation
in
the
town
is
supplied
with
the
new
and
pure
flame
they
then
feast
on
the
new
corn
and
fruits
and
dance
and
sing
for
three
days
and
the
four
following
days
they
receive
visits
and
rejoice
with
their
friends
from
neighboring
towns
who
have
in
like
manner
purified
and
prepared
themselves
the
mexicans
also
practised
a
similar
purification
at
the
end
of
every
fifty
two
years
in
the
belief
that
it
was
time
for
the
world
to
come
to
an
end
i
have
scarcely
heard
of
a
truer
sacrament
that
is
as
the
dictionary
defines
it
outward
and
visible
sign
of
an
inward
and
spiritual
grace
than
this
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
were
originally
inspired
directly
from
heaven
to
do
thus
though
they
have
no
biblical
record
of
the
revelation
*
*
*
*
*
for
more
than
five
years
i
maintained
myself
thus
solely
by
the
labor
of
my
hands
and
i
found
that
by
working
about
six
weeks
in
a
year
i
could
meet
all
the
expenses
of
living
the
whole
of
my
winters
as
well
as
most
of
my
summers
i
had
free
and
clear
for
study
i
have
thoroughly
tried
school
keeping
and
found
that
my
expenses
were
in
proportion
or
rather
out
of
proportion
to
my
income
for
i
was
obliged
to
dress
and
train
not
to
say
think
and
believe
accordingly
and
i
lost
my
time
into
the
bargain
as
i
did
not
teach
for
the
good
of
my
fellow
men
but
simply
for
a
livelihood
this
was
a
failure
i
have
tried
trade
but
i
found
that
it
would
take
ten
years
to
get
under
way
in
that
and
that
then
i
should
probably
be
on
my
way
to
the
devil
i
was
actually
afraid
that
i
might
by
that
time
be
doing
what
is
called
a
good
business
when
formerly
i
was
looking
about
to
see
what
i
could
do
for
a
living
some
sad
experience
in
conforming
to
the
wishes
of
friends
being
fresh
in
my
mind
to
tax
my
ingenuity
i
thought
often
and
seriously
of
picking
huckleberries
that
surely
i
could
do
and
its
small
profits
might
suffice
for
my
greatest
skill
has
been
to
want
but
little
so
little
capital
it
required
so
little
distraction
from
my
wonted
moods
i
foolishly
thought
while
my
acquaintances
went
unhesitatingly
into
trade
or
the
professions
i
contemplated
this
occupation
as
most
like
theirs
ranging
the
hills
all
summer
to
pick
the
berries
which
came
in
my
way
and
thereafter
carelessly
dispose
of
them
so
to
keep
the
flocks
of
admetus
i
also
dreamed
that
i
might
gather
the
wild
herbs
or
carry
evergreens
to
such
villagers
as
loved
to
be
reminded
of
the
woods
even
to
the
city
by
hay
cart
loads
but
i
have
since
learned
that
trade
curses
everything
it
handles
and
though
you
trade
in
messages
from
heaven
the
whole
curse
of
trade
attaches
to
the
business
as
i
preferred
some
things
to
others
and
especially
valued
my
freedom
as
i
could
fare
hard
and
yet
succeed
well
i
did
not
wish
to
spend
my
time
in
earning
rich
carpets
or
other
fine
furniture
or
delicate
cookery
or
a
house
in
the
grecian
or
the
gothic
style
just
yet
if
there
are
any
to
whom
it
is
no
interruption
to
acquire
these
things
and
who
know
how
to
use
them
when
acquired
i
relinquish
to
them
the
pursuit
some
are
industrious
and
appear
to
love
labor
for
its
own
sake
or
perhaps
because
it
keeps
them
out
of
worse
mischief
to
such
i
have
at
present
nothing
to
say
those
who
would
not
know
what
to
do
with
more
leisure
than
they
now
enjoy
i
might
advise
to
work
twice
as
hard
as
they
do
work
till
they
pay
for
themselves
and
get
their
free
papers
for
myself
i
found
that
the
occupation
of
a
day
laborer
was
the
most
independent
of
any
especially
as
it
required
only
thirty
or
forty
days
in
a
year
to
support
one
the
laborer
s
day
ends
with
the
going
down
of
the
sun
and
he
is
then
free
to
devote
himself
to
his
chosen
pursuit
independent
of
his
labor
but
his
employer
who
speculates
from
month
to
month
has
no
respite
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
in
short
i
am
convinced
both
by
faith
and
experience
that
to
maintain
one
s
self
on
this
earth
is
not
a
hardship
but
a
pastime
if
we
will
live
simply
and
wisely
as
the
pursuits
of
the
simpler
nations
are
still
the
sports
of
the
more
artificial
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
man
should
earn
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
unless
he
sweats
easier
than
i
do
one
young
man
of
my
acquaintance
who
has
inherited
some
acres
told
me
that
he
thought
he
should
live
as
i
did
if
he
had
the
means
i
would
not
have
any
one
adopt
my
mode
of
living
on
any
account
for
beside
that
before
he
has
fairly
learned
it
i
may
have
found
out
another
for
myself
i
desire
that
there
may
be
as
many
different
persons
in
the
world
as
possible
but
i
would
have
each
one
be
very
careful
to
find
out
and
pursue
his
own
way
and
not
his
father
s
or
his
mother
s
or
his
neighbor
s
instead
the
youth
may
build
or
plant
or
sail
only
let
him
not
be
hindered
from
doing
that
which
he
tells
me
he
would
like
to
do
it
is
by
a
mathematical
point
only
that
we
are
wise
as
the
sailor
or
the
fugitive
slave
keeps
the
polestar
in
his
eye
but
that
is
sufficient
guidance
for
all
our
life
we
may
not
arrive
at
our
port
within
a
calculable
period
but
we
would
preserve
the
true
course
undoubtedly
in
this
case
what
is
true
for
one
is
truer
still
for
a
thousand
as
a
large
house
is
not
proportionally
more
expensive
than
a
small
one
since
one
roof
may
cover
one
cellar
underlie
and
one
wall
separate
several
apartments
but
for
my
part
i
preferred
the
solitary
dwelling
moreover
it
will
commonly
be
cheaper
to
build
the
whole
yourself
than
to
convince
another
of
the
advantage
of
the
common
wall
and
when
you
have
done
this
the
common
partition
to
be
much
cheaper
must
be
a
thin
one
and
that
other
may
prove
a
bad
neighbor
and
also
not
keep
his
side
in
repair
the
only
co
operation
which
is
commonly
possible
is
exceedingly
partial
and
superficial
and
what
little
true
co
operation
there
is
is
as
if
it
were
not
being
a
harmony
inaudible
to
men
if
a
man
has
faith
he
will
co
operate
with
equal
faith
everywhere
if
he
has
not
faith
he
will
continue
to
live
like
the
rest
of
the
world
whatever
company
he
is
joined
to
to
co
operate
in
the
highest
as
well
as
the
lowest
sense
means
to
get
our
living
together
i
heard
it
proposed
lately
that
two
young
men
should
travel
together
over
the
world
the
one
without
money
earning
his
means
as
he
went
before
the
mast
and
behind
the
plow
the
other
carrying
a
bill
of
exchange
in
his
pocket
it
was
easy
to
see
that
they
could
not
long
be
companions
or
co
operate
since
one
would
not
operate
at
all
they
would
part
at
the
first
interesting
crisis
in
their
adventures
above
all
as
i
have
implied
the
man
who
goes
alone
can
start
today
but
he
who
travels
with
another
must
wait
till
that
other
is
ready
and
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
they
get
off
*
*
*
*
*
but
all
this
is
very
selfish
i
have
heard
some
of
my
townsmen
say
i
confess
that
i
have
hitherto
indulged
very
little
in
philanthropic
enterprises
i
have
made
some
sacrifices
to
a
sense
of
duty
and
among
others
have
sacrificed
this
pleasure
also
there
are
those
who
have
used
all
their
arts
to
persuade
me
to
undertake
the
support
of
some
poor
family
in
the
town
and
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
for
the
devil
finds
employment
for
the
idle
i
might
try
my
hand
at
some
such
pastime
as
that
however
when
i
have
thought
to
indulge
myself
in
this
respect
and
lay
their
heaven
under
an
obligation
by
maintaining
certain
poor
persons
in
all
respects
as
comfortably
as
i
maintain
myself
and
have
even
ventured
so
far
as
to
make
them
the
offer
they
have
one
and
all
unhesitatingly
preferred
to
remain
poor
while
my
townsmen
and
women
are
devoted
in
so
many
ways
to
the
good
of
their
fellows
i
trust
that
one
at
least
may
be
spared
to
other
and
less
humane
pursuits
you
must
have
a
genius
for
charity
as
well
as
for
anything
else
as
for
doing
good
that
is
one
of
the
professions
which
are
full
moreover
i
have
tried
it
fairly
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
am
satisfied
that
it
does
not
agree
with
my
constitution
probably
i
should
not
consciously
and
deliberately
forsake
my
particular
calling
to
do
the
good
which
society
demands
of
me
to
save
the
universe
from
annihilation
and
i
believe
that
a
like
but
infinitely
greater
steadfastness
elsewhere
is
all
that
now
preserves
it
but
i
would
not
stand
between
any
man
and
his
genius
and
to
him
who
does
this
work
which
i
decline
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
and
life
i
would
say
persevere
even
if
the
world
call
it
doing
evil
as
it
is
most
likely
they
will
i
am
far
from
supposing
that
my
case
is
a
peculiar
one
no
doubt
many
of
my
readers
would
make
a
similar
defence
at
doing
something
i
will
not
engage
that
my
neighbors
shall
pronounce
it
good
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
i
should
be
a
capital
fellow
to
hire
but
what
that
is
it
is
for
my
employer
to
find
out
what
good
i
do
in
the
common
sense
of
that
word
must
be
aside
from
my
main
path
and
for
the
most
part
wholly
unintended
men
say
practically
begin
where
you
are
and
such
as
you
are
without
aiming
mainly
to
become
of
more
worth
and
with
kindness
aforethought
go
about
doing
good
if
i
were
to
preach
at
all
in
this
strain
i
should
say
rather
set
about
being
good
as
if
the
sun
should
stop
when
he
had
kindled
his
fires
up
to
the
splendor
of
a
moon
or
a
star
of
the
sixth
magnitude
and
go
about
like
a
robin
goodfellow
peeping
in
at
every
cottage
window
inspiring
lunatics
and
tainting
meats
and
making
darkness
visible
instead
of
steadily
increasing
his
genial
heat
and
beneficence
till
he
is
of
such
brightness
that
no
mortal
can
look
him
in
the
face
and
then
and
in
the
meanwhile
too
going
about
the
world
in
his
own
orbit
doing
it
good
or
rather
as
a
truer
philosophy
has
discovered
the
world
going
about
him
getting
good
when
phaeton
wishing
to
prove
his
heavenly
birth
by
his
beneficence
had
the
sun
s
chariot
but
one
day
and
drove
out
of
the
beaten
track
he
burned
several
blocks
of
houses
in
the
lower
streets
of
heaven
and
scorched
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
dried
up
every
spring
and
made
the
great
desert
of
sahara
till
at
length
jupiter
hurled
him
headlong
to
the
earth
with
a
thunderbolt
and
the
sun
through
grief
at
his
death
did
not
shine
for
a
year
there
is
no
odor
so
bad
as
that
which
arises
from
goodness
tainted
it
is
human
it
is
divine
carrion
if
i
knew
for
a
certainty
that
a
man
was
coming
to
my
house
with
the
conscious
design
of
doing
me
good
i
should
run
for
my
life
as
from
that
dry
and
parching
wind
of
the
african
deserts
called
the
simoom
which
fills
the
mouth
and
nose
and
ears
and
eyes
with
dust
till
you
are
suffocated
for
fear
that
i
should
get
some
of
his
good
done
to
me
some
of
its
virus
mingled
with
my
blood
no
in
this
case
i
would
rather
suffer
evil
the
natural
way
a
man
is
not
a
good
man
to
me
because
he
will
feed
me
if
i
should
be
starving
or
warm
me
if
i
should
be
freezing
or
pull
me
out
of
a
ditch
if
i
should
ever
fall
into
one
i
can
find
you
a
newfoundland
dog
that
will
do
as
much
philanthropy
is
not
love
for
one
s
fellow
man
in
the
broadest
sense
howard
was
no
doubt
an
exceedingly
kind
and
worthy
man
in
his
way
and
has
his
reward
but
comparatively
speaking
what
are
a
hundred
howards
to
us
if
their
philanthropy
do
not
help
us
in
our
best
estate
when
we
are
most
worthy
to
be
helped
i
never
heard
of
a
philanthropic
meeting
in
which
it
was
sincerely
proposed
to
do
any
good
to
me
or
the
like
of
me
the
jesuits
were
quite
balked
by
those
indians
who
being
burned
at
the
stake
suggested
new
modes
of
torture
to
their
tormentors
being
superior
to
physical
suffering
it
sometimes
chanced
that
they
were
superior
to
any
consolation
which
the
missionaries
could
offer
and
the
law
to
do
as
you
would
be
done
by
fell
with
less
persuasiveness
on
the
ears
of
those
who
for
their
part
did
not
care
how
they
were
done
by
who
loved
their
enemies
after
a
new
fashion
and
came
very
near
freely
forgiving
them
all
they
did
be
sure
that
you
give
the
poor
the
aid
they
most
need
though
it
be
your
example
which
leaves
them
far
behind
if
you
give
money
spend
yourself
with
it
and
do
not
merely
abandon
it
to
them
we
make
curious
mistakes
sometimes
often
the
poor
man
is
not
so
cold
and
hungry
as
he
is
dirty
and
ragged
and
gross
it
is
partly
his
taste
and
not
merely
his
misfortune
if
you
give
him
money
he
will
perhaps
buy
more
rags
with
it
i
was
wont
to
pity
the
clumsy
irish
laborers
who
cut
ice
on
the
pond
in
such
mean
and
ragged
clothes
while
i
shivered
in
my
more
tidy
and
somewhat
more
fashionable
garments
till
one
bitter
cold
day
one
who
had
slipped
into
the
water
came
to
my
house
to
warm
him
and
i
saw
him
strip
off
three
pairs
of
pants
and
two
pairs
of
stockings
ere
he
got
down
to
the
skin
though
they
were
dirty
and
ragged
enough
it
is
true
and
that
he
could
afford
to
refuse
the
extra
garments
which
i
offered
him
he
had
so
many
intra
ones
this
ducking
was
the
very
thing
he
needed
then
i
began
to
pity
myself
and
i
saw
that
it
would
be
a
greater
charity
to
bestow
on
me
a
flannel
shirt
than
a
whole
slop
shop
on
him
there
are
a
thousand
hacking
at
the
branches
of
evil
to
one
who
is
striking
at
the
root
and
it
may
be
that
he
who
bestows
the
largest
amount
of
time
and
money
on
the
needy
is
doing
the
most
by
his
mode
of
life
to
produce
that
misery
which
he
strives
in
vain
to
relieve
it
is
the
pious
slave
breeder
devoting
the
proceeds
of
every
tenth
slave
to
buy
a
sunday
s
liberty
for
the
rest
some
show
their
kindness
to
the
poor
by
employing
them
in
their
kitchens
would
they
not
be
kinder
if
they
employed
themselves
there
you
boast
of
spending
a
tenth
part
of
your
income
in
charity
maybe
you
should
spend
the
nine
tenths
so
and
done
with
it
society
recovers
only
a
tenth
part
of
the
property
then
is
this
owing
to
the
generosity
of
him
in
whose
possession
it
is
found
or
to
the
remissness
of
the
officers
of
justice
philanthropy
is
almost
the
only
virtue
which
is
sufficiently
appreciated
by
mankind
nay
it
is
greatly
overrated
and
it
is
our
selfishness
which
overrates
it
a
robust
poor
man
one
sunny
day
here
in
concord
praised
a
fellow
townsman
to
me
because
as
he
said
he
was
kind
to
the
poor
meaning
himself
the
kind
uncles
and
aunts
of
the
race
are
more
esteemed
than
its
true
spiritual
fathers
and
mothers
i
once
heard
a
reverend
lecturer
on
england
a
man
of
learning
and
intelligence
after
enumerating
her
scientific
literary
and
political
worthies
shakespeare
bacon
cromwell
milton
newton
and
others
speak
next
of
her
christian
heroes
whom
as
if
his
profession
required
it
of
him
he
elevated
to
a
place
far
above
all
the
rest
as
the
greatest
of
the
great
they
were
penn
howard
and
mrs
fry
every
one
must
feel
the
falsehood
and
cant
of
this
the
last
were
not
england
s
best
men
and
women
only
perhaps
her
best
philanthropists
i
would
not
subtract
anything
from
the
praise
that
is
due
to
philanthropy
but
merely
demand
justice
for
all
who
by
their
lives
and
works
are
a
blessing
to
mankind
i
do
not
value
chiefly
a
man
s
uprightness
and
benevolence
which
are
as
it
were
his
stem
and
leaves
those
plants
of
whose
greenness
withered
we
make
herb
tea
for
the
sick
serve
but
a
humble
use
and
are
most
employed
by
quacks
i
want
the
flower
and
fruit
of
a
man
that
some
fragrance
be
wafted
over
from
him
to
me
and
some
ripeness
flavor
our
intercourse
his
goodness
must
not
be
a
partial
and
transitory
act
but
a
constant
superfluity
which
costs
him
nothing
and
of
which
he
is
unconscious
this
is
a
charity
that
hides
a
multitude
of
sins
the
philanthropist
too
often
surrounds
mankind
with
the
remembrance
of
his
own
castoff
griefs
as
an
atmosphere
and
calls
it
sympathy
we
should
impart
our
courage
and
not
our
despair
our
health
and
ease
and
not
our
disease
and
take
care
that
this
does
not
spread
by
contagion
from
what
southern
plains
comes
up
the
voice
of
wailing
under
what
latitudes
reside
the
heathen
to
whom
we
would
send
light
who
is
that
intemperate
and
brutal
man
whom
we
would
redeem
if
anything
ail
a
man
so
that
he
does
not
perform
his
functions
if
he
have
a
pain
in
his
bowels
even
for
that
is
the
seat
of
sympathy
he
forthwith
sets
about
reforming
the
world
being
a
microcosm
himself
he
discovers
and
it
is
a
true
discovery
and
he
is
the
man
to
make
it
that
the
world
has
been
eating
green
apples
to
his
eyes
in
fact
the
globe
itself
is
a
great
green
apple
which
there
is
danger
awful
to
think
of
that
the
children
of
men
will
nibble
before
it
is
ripe
and
straightway
his
drastic
philanthropy
seeks
out
the
esquimau
and
the
patagonian
and
embraces
the
populous
indian
and
chinese
villages
and
thus
by
a
few
years
of
philanthropic
activity
the
powers
in
the
meanwhile
using
him
for
their
own
ends
no
doubt
he
cures
himself
of
his
dyspepsia
the
globe
acquires
a
faint
blush
on
one
or
both
of
its
cheeks
as
if
it
were
beginning
to
be
ripe
and
life
loses
its
crudity
and
is
once
more
sweet
and
wholesome
to
live
i
never
dreamed
of
any
enormity
greater
than
i
have
committed
i
never
knew
and
never
shall
know
a
worse
man
than
myself
i
believe
that
what
so
saddens
the
reformer
is
not
his
sympathy
with
his
fellows
in
distress
but
though
he
be
the
holiest
son
of
god
is
his
private
ail
let
this
be
righted
let
the
spring
come
to
him
the
morning
rise
over
his
couch
and
he
will
forsake
his
generous
companions
without
apology
my
excuse
for
not
lecturing
against
the
use
of
tobacco
is
that
i
never
chewed
it
that
is
a
penalty
which
reformed
tobacco
chewers
have
to
pay
though
there
are
things
enough
i
have
chewed
which
i
could
lecture
against
if
you
should
ever
be
betrayed
into
any
of
these
philanthropies
do
not
let
your
left
hand
know
what
your
right
hand
does
for
it
is
not
worth
knowing
rescue
the
drowning
and
tie
your
shoestrings
take
your
time
and
set
about
some
free
labor
our
manners
have
been
corrupted
by
communication
with
the
saints
our
hymn
books
resound
with
a
melodious
cursing
of
god
and
enduring
him
forever
one
would
say
that
even
the
prophets
and
redeemers
had
rather
consoled
the
fears
than
confirmed
the
hopes
of
man
there
is
nowhere
recorded
a
simple
and
irrepressible
satisfaction
with
the
gift
of
life
any
memorable
praise
of
god
all
health
and
success
does
me
good
however
far
off
and
withdrawn
it
may
appear
all
disease
and
failure
helps
to
make
me
sad
and
does
me
evil
however
much
sympathy
it
may
have
with
me
or
i
with
it
if
then
we
would
indeed
restore
mankind
by
truly
indian
botanic
magnetic
or
natural
means
let
us
first
be
as
simple
and
well
as
nature
ourselves
dispel
the
clouds
which
hang
over
our
own
brows
and
take
up
a
little
life
into
our
pores
do
not
stay
to
be
an
overseer
of
the
poor
but
endeavor
to
become
one
of
the
worthies
of
the
world
i
read
in
the
gulistan
or
flower
garden
of
sheik
sadi
of
shiraz
that
they
asked
a
wise
man
saying
of
the
many
celebrated
trees
which
the
most
high
god
has
created
lofty
and
umbrageous
they
call
none
azad
or
free
excepting
the
cypress
which
bears
no
fruit
what
mystery
is
there
in
this
he
replied
each
has
its
appropriate
produce
and
appointed
season
during
the
continuance
of
which
it
is
fresh
and
blooming
and
during
their
absence
dry
and
withered
to
neither
of
which
states
is
the
cypress
exposed
being
always
flourishing
and
of
this
nature
are
the
azads
or
religious
independents
fix
not
thy
heart
on
that
which
is
transitory
for
the
dijlah
or
tigris

continue
to
flow
through
bagdad
after
the
race
of
caliphs
is
extinct
if
thy
hand
has
plenty
be
liberal
as
the
date
tree
but
if
it
affords
nothing
to
give
away
be
an
azad
or
free
man
like
the
cypress
complemental
verses
the
pretensions
of
poverty
thou
dost
presume
too
much
poor
needy
wretch
to
claim
a
station
in
the
firmament
because
thy
humble
cottage
or
thy
tub
nurses
some
lazy
or
pedantic
virtue
in
the
cheap
sunshine
or
by
shady
springs
with
roots
and
pot
herbs
where
thy
right
hand
tearing
those
humane
passions
from
the
mind
upon
whose
stocks
fair
blooming
virtues
flourish
degradeth
nature
and
benumbeth

and

study
to

but
what
those
worthies
were
t
carew
where
i
lived
and
what
i
lived
for
at
a
certain
season
of
our
life
we
are
accustomed
to
consider
every
spot
as
the
possible
site
of
a
house
i
have
thus
surveyed
the
country
on
every
side
within
a
dozen
miles
of
where
i
live
in
imagination
i
have
bought
all
the
farms
in
succession
for
all
were
to
be
bought
and
i
knew
their
price
i
walked
over
each
farmer
s
premises
tasted
his
wild
apples
discoursed
on
husbandry
with
him
took
his
farm
at
his
price
at
any
price
mortgaging
it
to
him
in
my
mind
even
put
a
higher
price
on
it
took
everything
but
a
deed
of
it
took
his
word
for
his
deed
for
i
dearly
love
to
talk
cultivated
it
and
him
too
to
some
extent
i
trust
and
withdrew
when
i
had
enjoyed
it
long
enough
leaving
him
to
carry
it
on
this
experience
entitled
me
to
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
real
estate
broker
by
my
friends
wherever
i
sat
there
i
might
live
and
the
landscape
radiated
from
me
accordingly
what
is
a
house
but
a
sedes
a
seat
better
if
a
country
seat
i
discovered
many
a
site
for
a
house
not
likely
to
be
soon
improved
which
some
might
have
thought
too
far
from
the
village
but
to
my
eyes
the
village
was
too
far
from
it
well
there
i
might
live
i
said
and
there
i
did
live
for
an
hour
a
summer
and
a
winter
life
saw
how
i
could
let
the
years
run
off
buffet
the
winter
through
and
see
the
spring
come
in
the
future
inhabitants
of
this
region
wherever
they
may
place
their
houses
may
be
sure
that
they
have
been
anticipated
an
afternoon
sufficed
to
lay
out
the
land
into
orchard
wood
lot
and
pasture
and
to
decide
what
fine
oaks
or
pines
should
be
left
to
stand
before
the
door
and
whence
each
blasted
tree
could
be
seen
to
the
best
advantage
and
then
i
let
it
lie
fallow
perchance
for
a
man
is
rich
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
things
which
he
can
afford
to
let
alone
my
imagination
carried
me
so
far
that
i
even
had
the
refusal
of
several
farms
the
refusal
was
all
i
wanted
but
i
never
got
my
fingers
burned
by
actual
possession
the
nearest
that
i
came
to
actual
possession
was
when
i
bought
the
hollowell
place
and
had
begun
to
sort
my
seeds
and
collected
materials
with
which
to
make
a
wheelbarrow
to
carry
it
on
or
off
with
but
before
the
owner
gave
me
a
deed
of
it
his
wife
every
man
has
such
a
wife
changed
her
mind
and
wished
to
keep
it
and
he
offered
me
ten
dollars
to
release
him
now
to
speak
the
truth
i
had
but
ten
cents
in
the
world
and
it
surpassed
my
arithmetic
to
tell
if
i
was
that
man
who
had
ten
cents
or
who
had
a
farm
or
ten
dollars
or
all
together
however
i
let
him
keep
the
ten
dollars
and
the
farm
too
for
i
had
carried
it
far
enough
or
rather
to
be
generous
i
sold
him
the
farm
for
just
what
i
gave
for
it
and
as
he
was
not
a
rich
man
made
him
a
present
of
ten
dollars
and
still
had
my
ten
cents
and
seeds
and
materials
for
a
wheelbarrow
left
i
found
thus
that
i
had
been
a
rich
man
without
any
damage
to
my
poverty
but
i
retained
the
landscape
and
i
have
since
annually
carried
off
what
it
yielded
without
a
wheelbarrow
with
respect
to
landscapes
i
am
monarch
of
all
i
survey
my
right
there
is
none
to
dispute
i
have
frequently
seen
a
poet
withdraw
having
enjoyed
the
most
valuable
part
of
a
farm
while
the
crusty
farmer
supposed
that
he
had
got
a
few
wild
apples
only
why
the
owner
does
not
know
it
for
many
years
when
a
poet
has
put
his
farm
in
rhyme
the
most
admirable
kind
of
invisible
fence
has
fairly
impounded
it
milked
it
skimmed
it
and
got
all
the
cream
and
left
the
farmer
only
the
skimmed
milk
the
real
attractions
of
the
hollowell
farm
to
me
were
its
complete
retirement
being
about
two
miles
from
the
village
half
a
mile
from
the
nearest
neighbor
and
separated
from
the
highway
by
a
broad
field
its
bounding
on
the
river
which
the
owner
said
protected
it
by
its
fogs
from
frosts
in
the
spring
though
that
was
nothing
to
me
the
gray
color
and
ruinous
state
of
the
house
and
barn
and
the
dilapidated
fences
which
put
such
an
interval
between
me
and
the
last
occupant
the
hollow
and
lichen
covered
apple
trees
gnawed
by
rabbits
showing
what
kind
of
neighbors
i
should
have
but
above
all
the
recollection
i
had
of
it
from
my
earliest
voyages
up
the
river
when
the
house
was
concealed
behind
a
dense
grove
of
red
maples
through
which
i
heard
the
house
dog
bark
i
was
in
haste
to
buy
it
before
the
proprietor
finished
getting
out
some
rocks
cutting
down
the
hollow
apple
trees
and
grubbing
up
some
young
birches
which
had
sprung
up
in
the
pasture
or
in
short
had
made
any
more
of
his
improvements
to
enjoy
these
advantages
i
was
ready
to
carry
it
on
like
atlas
to
take
the
world
on
my
shoulders
i
never
heard
what
compensation
he
received
for
that
and
do
all
those
things
which
had
no
other
motive
or
excuse
but
that
i
might
pay
for
it
and
be
unmolested
in
my
possession
of
it
for
i
knew
all
the
while
that
it
would
yield
the
most
abundant
crop
of
the
kind
i
wanted
if
i
could
only
afford
to
let
it
alone
but
it
turned
out
as
i
have
said
all
that
i
could
say
then
with
respect
to
farming
on
a
large
scale
i
have
always
cultivated
a
garden
was
that
i
had
had
my
seeds
ready
many
think
that
seeds
improve
with
age
i
have
no
doubt
that
time
discriminates
between
the
good
and
the
bad
and
when
at
last
i
shall
plant
i
shall
be
less
likely
to
be
disappointed
but
i
would
say
to
my
fellows
once
for
all
as
long
as
possible
live
free
and
uncommitted
it
makes
but
little
difference
whether
you
are
committed
to
a
farm
or
the
county
jail
old
cato
whose
de
re
rustic
is
my
cultivator
says
and
the
only
translation
i
have
seen
makes
sheer
nonsense
of
the
passage
when
you
think
of
getting
a
farm
turn
it
thus
in
your
mind
not
to
buy
greedily
nor
spare
your
pains
to
look
at
it
and
do
not
think
it
enough
to
go
round
it
once
the
oftener
you
go
there
the
more
it
will
please
you
if
it
is
good
i
think
i
shall
not
buy
greedily
but
go
round
and
round
it
as
long
as
i
live
and
be
buried
in
it
first
that
it
may
please
me
the
more
at
last

the
present
was
my
next
experiment
of
this
kind
which
i
purpose
to
describe
more
at
length
for
convenience
putting
the
experience
of
two
years
into
one
as
i
have
said
i
do
not
propose
to
write
an
ode
to
dejection
but
to
brag
as
lustily
as
chanticleer
in
the
morning
standing
on
his
roost
if
only
to
wake
my
neighbors
up
when
first
i
took
up
my
abode
in
the
woods
that
is
began
to
spend
my
nights
as
well
as
days
there
which
by
accident
was
on
independence
day
or
the
fourth
of
july
1845
my
house
was
not
finished
for
winter
but
was
merely
a
defence
against
the
rain
without
plastering
or
chimney
the
walls
being
of
rough
weather
stained
boards
with
wide
chinks
which
made
it
cool
at
night
the
upright
white
hewn
studs
and
freshly
planed
door
and
window
casings
gave
it
a
clean
and
airy
look
especially
in
the
morning
when
its
timbers
were
saturated
with
dew
so
that
i
fancied
that
by
noon
some
sweet
gum
would
exude
from
them
to
my
imagination
it
retained
throughout
the
day
more
or
less
of
this
auroral
character
reminding
me
of
a
certain
house
on
a
mountain
which
i
had
visited
a
year
before
this
was
an
airy
and
unplastered
cabin
fit
to
entertain
a
travelling
god
and
where
a
goddess
might
trail
her
garments
the
winds
which
passed
over
my
dwelling
were
such
as
sweep
over
the
ridges
of
mountains
bearing
the
broken
strains
or
celestial
parts
only
of
terrestrial
music
the
morning
wind
forever
blows
the
poem
of
creation
is
uninterrupted
but
few
are
the
ears
that
hear
it
olympus
is
but
the
outside
of
the
earth
everywhere
the
only
house
i
had
been
the
owner
of
before
if
i
except
a
boat
was
a
tent
which
i
used
occasionally
when
making
excursions
in
the
summer
and
this
is
still
rolled
up
in
my
garret
but
the
boat
after
passing
from
hand
to
hand
has
gone
down
the
stream
of
time
with
this
more
substantial
shelter
about
me
i
had
made
some
progress
toward
settling
in
the
world
this
frame
so
slightly
clad
was
a
sort
of
crystallization
around
me
and
reacted
on
the
builder
it
was
suggestive
somewhat
as
a
picture
in
outlines
i
did
not
need
to
go
outdoors
to
take
the
air
for
the
atmosphere
within
had
lost
none
of
its
freshness
it
was
not
so
much
within
doors
as
behind
a
door
where
i
sat
even
in
the
rainiest
weather
the
harivansa
says
an
abode
without
birds
is
like
a
meat
without
seasoning
such
was
not
my
abode
for
i
found
myself
suddenly
neighbor
to
the
birds
not
by
having
imprisoned
one
but
having
caged
myself
near
them
i
was
not
only
nearer
to
some
of
those
which
commonly
frequent
the
garden
and
the
orchard
but
to
those
smaller
and
more
thrilling
songsters
of
the
forest
which
never
or
rarely
serenade
a
villager
the
wood
thrush
the
veery
the
scarlet
tanager
the
field
sparrow
the
whip
poor
will
and
many
others
i
was
seated
by
the
shore
of
a
small
pond
about
a
mile
and
a
half
south
of
the
village
of
concord
and
somewhat
higher
than
it
in
the
midst
of
an
extensive
wood
between
that
town
and
lincoln
and
about
two
miles
south
of
that
our
only
field
known
to
fame
concord
battle
ground
but
i
was
so
low
in
the
woods
that
the
opposite
shore
half
a
mile
off
like
the
rest
covered
with
wood
was
my
most
distant
horizon
for
the
first
week
whenever
i
looked
out
on
the
pond
it
impressed
me
like
a
tarn
high
up
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
its
bottom
far
above
the
surface
of
other
lakes
and
as
the
sun
arose
i
saw
it
throwing
off
its
nightly
clothing
of
mist
and
here
and
there
by
degrees
its
soft
ripples
or
its
smooth
reflecting
surface
was
revealed
while
the
mists
like
ghosts
were
stealthily
withdrawing
in
every
direction
into
the
woods
as
at
the
breaking
up
of
some
nocturnal
conventicle
the
very
dew
seemed
to
hang
upon
the
trees
later
into
the
day
than
usual
as
on
the
sides
of
mountains
this
small
lake
was
of
most
value
as
a
neighbor
in
the
intervals
of
a
gentle
rain
storm
in
august
when
both
air
and
water
being
perfectly
still
but
the
sky
overcast
mid
afternoon
had
all
the
serenity
of
evening
and
the
wood
thrush
sang
around
and
was
heard
from
shore
to
shore
a
lake
like
this
is
never
smoother
than
at
such
a
time
and
the
clear
portion
of
the
air
above
it
being
shallow
and
darkened
by
clouds
the
water
full
of
light
and
reflections
becomes
a
lower
heaven
itself
so
much
the
more
important
from
a
hill
top
near
by
where
the
wood
had
been
recently
cut
off
there
was
a
pleasing
vista
southward
across
the
pond
through
a
wide
indentation
in
the
hills
which
form
the
shore
there
where
their
opposite
sides
sloping
toward
each
other
suggested
a
stream
flowing
out
in
that
direction
through
a
wooded
valley
but
stream
there
was
none
that
way
i
looked
between
and
over
the
near
green
hills
to
some
distant
and
higher
ones
in
the
horizon
tinged
with
blue
indeed
by
standing
on
tiptoe
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
some
of
the
peaks
of
the
still
bluer
and
more
distant
mountain
ranges
in
the
northwest
those
true
blue
coins
from
heaven
s
own
mint
and
also
of
some
portion
of
the
village
but
in
other
directions
even
from
this
point
i
could
not
see
over
or
beyond
the
woods
which
surrounded
me
it
is
well
to
have
some
water
in
your
neighborhood
to
give
buoyancy
to
and
float
the
earth
one
value
even
of
the
smallest
well
is
that
when
you
look
into
it
you
see
that
earth
is
not
continent
but
insular
this
is
as
important
as
that
it
keeps
butter
cool
when
i
looked
across
the
pond
from
this
peak
toward
the
sudbury
meadows
which
in
time
of
flood
i
distinguished
elevated
perhaps
by
a
mirage
in
their
seething
valley
like
a
coin
in
a
basin
all
the
earth
beyond
the
pond
appeared
like
a
thin
crust
insulated
and
floated
even
by
this
small
sheet
of
interverting
water
and
i
was
reminded
that
this
on
which
i
dwelt
was
but
dry
land
though
the
view
from
my
door
was
still
more
contracted
i
did
not
feel
crowded
or
confined
in
the
least
there
was
pasture
enough
for
my
imagination
the
low
shrub
oak
plateau
to
which
the
opposite
shore
arose
stretched
away
toward
the
prairies
of
the
west
and
the
steppes
of
tartary
affording
ample
room
for
all
the
roving
families
of
men
there
are
none
happy
in
the
world
but
beings
who
enjoy
freely
a
vast
horizon
said
damodara
when
his
herds
required
new
and
larger
pastures
both
place
and
time
were
changed
and
i
dwelt
nearer
to
those
parts
of
the
universe
and
to
those
eras
in
history
which
had
most
attracted
me
where
i
lived
was
as
far
off
as
many
a
region
viewed
nightly
by
astronomers
we
are
wont
to
imagine
rare
and
delectable
places
in
some
remote
and
more
celestial
corner
of
the
system
behind
the
constellation
of
cassiopeia
s
chair
far
from
noise
and
disturbance
i
discovered
that
my
house
actually
had
its
site
in
such
a
withdrawn
but
forever
new
and
unprofaned
part
of
the
universe
if
it
were
worth
the
while
to
settle
in
those
parts
near
to
the
pleiades
or
the
hyades
to
aldebaran
or
altair
then
i
was
really
there
or
at
an
equal
remoteness
from
the
life
which
i
had
left
behind
dwindled
and
twinkling
with
as
fine
a
ray
to
my
nearest
neighbor
and
to
be
seen
only
in
moonless
nights
by
him
such
was
that
part
of
creation
where
i
had
squatted
there
was
a
shepherd
that
did
live
and
held
his
thoughts
as
high
as
were
the
mounts
whereon
his
flocks
did
hourly
feed
him
by
what
should
we
think
of
the
shepherd
s
life
if
his
flocks
always
wandered
to
higher
pastures
than
his
thoughts
every
morning
was
a
cheerful
invitation
to
make
my
life
of
equal
simplicity
and
i
may
say
innocence
with
nature
herself
i
have
been
as
sincere
a
worshipper
of
aurora
as
the
greeks
i
got
up
early
and
bathed
in
the
pond
that
was
a
religious
exercise
and
one
of
the
best
things
which
i
did
they
say
that
characters
were
engraven
on
the
bathing
tub
of
king
tchingthang
to
this
effect
renew
thyself
completely
each
day
do
it
again
and
again
and
forever
again
i
can
understand
that
morning
brings
back
the
heroic
ages
i
was
as
much
affected
by
the
faint
hum
of
a
mosquito
making
its
invisible
and
unimaginable
tour
through
my
apartment
at
earliest
dawn
when
i
was
sitting
with
door
and
windows
open
as
i
could
be
by
any
trumpet
that
ever
sang
of
fame
it
was
homer
s
requiem
itself
an
iliad
and
odyssey
in
the
air
singing
its
own
wrath
and
wanderings
there
was
something
cosmical
about
it
a
standing
advertisement
till
forbidden
of
the
everlasting
vigor
and
fertility
of
the
world
the
morning
which
is
the
most
memorable
season
of
the
day
is
the
awakening
hour
then
there
is
least
somnolence
in
us
and
for
an
hour
at
least
some
part
of
us
awakes
which
slumbers
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
little
is
to
be
expected
of
that
day
if
it
can
be
called
a
day
to
which
we
are
not
awakened
by
our
genius
but
by
the
mechanical
nudgings
of
some
servitor
are
not
awakened
by
our
own
newly
acquired
force
and
aspirations
from
within
accompanied
by
the
undulations
of
celestial
music
instead
of
factory
bells
and
a
fragrance
filling
the
air
to
a
higher
life
than
we
fell
asleep
from
and
thus
the
darkness
bear
its
fruit
and
prove
itself
to
be
good
no
less
than
the
light
that
man
who
does
not
believe
that
each
day
contains
an
earlier
more
sacred
and
auroral
hour
than
he
has
yet
profaned
has
despaired
of
life
and
is
pursuing
a
descending
and
darkening
way
after
a
partial
cessation
of
his
sensuous
life
the
soul
of
man
or
its
organs
rather
are
reinvigorated
each
day
and
his
genius
tries
again
what
noble
life
it
can
make
all
memorable
events
i
should
say
transpire
in
morning
time
and
in
a
morning
atmosphere
the
vedas
say
all
intelligences
awake
with
the
morning
poetry
and
art
and
the
fairest
and
most
memorable
of
the
actions
of
men
date
from
such
an
hour
all
poets
and
heroes
like
memnon
are
the
children
of
aurora
and
emit
their
music
at
sunrise
to
him
whose
elastic
and
vigorous
thought
keeps
pace
with
the
sun
the
day
is
a
perpetual
morning
it
matters
not
what
the
clocks
say
or
the
attitudes
and
labors
of
men
morning
is
when
i
am
awake
and
there
is
a
dawn
in
me
moral
reform
is
the
effort
to
throw
off
sleep
why
is
it
that
men
give
so
poor
an
account
of
their
day
if
they
have
not
been
slumbering
they
are
not
such
poor
calculators
if
they
had
not
been
overcome
with
drowsiness
they
would
have
performed
something
the
millions
are
awake
enough
for
physical
labor
but
only
one
in
a
million
is
awake
enough
for
effective
intellectual
exertion
only
one
in
a
hundred
millions
to
a
poetic
or
divine
life
to
be
awake
is
to
be
alive
i
have
never
yet
met
a
man
who
was
quite
awake
how
could
i
have
looked
him
in
the
face
we
must
learn
to
reawaken
and
keep
ourselves
awake
not
by
mechanical
aids
but
by
an
infinite
expectation
of
the
dawn
which
does
not
forsake
us
in
our
soundest
sleep
i
know
of
no
more
encouraging
fact
than
the
unquestionable
ability
of
man
to
elevate
his
life
by
a
conscious
endeavor
it
is
something
to
be
able
to
paint
a
particular
picture
or
to
carve
a
statue
and
so
to
make
a
few
objects
beautiful
but
it
is
far
more
glorious
to
carve
and
paint
the
very
atmosphere
and
medium
through
which
we
look
which
morally
we
can
do
to
affect
the
quality
of
the
day
that
is
the
highest
of
arts
every
man
is
tasked
to
make
his
life
even
in
its
details
worthy
of
the
contemplation
of
his
most
elevated
and
critical
hour
if
we
refused
or
rather
used
up
such
paltry
information
as
we
get
the
oracles
would
distinctly
inform
us
how
this
might
be
done
i
went
to
the
woods
because
i
wished
to
live
deliberately
to
front
only
the
essential
facts
of
life
and
see
if
i
could
not
learn
what
it
had
to
teach
and
not
when
i
came
to
die
discover
that
i
had
not
lived
i
did
not
wish
to
live
what
was
not
life
living
is
so
dear
nor
did
i
wish
to
practise
resignation
unless
it
was
quite
necessary
i
wanted
to
live
deep
and
suck
out
all
the
marrow
of
life
to
live
so
sturdily
and
spartan
like
as
to
put
to
rout
all
that
was
not
life
to
cut
a
broad
swath
and
shave
close
to
drive
life
into
a
corner
and
reduce
it
to
its
lowest
terms
and
if
it
proved
to
be
mean
why
then
to
get
the
whole
and
genuine
meanness
of
it
and
publish
its
meanness
to
the
world
or
if
it
were
sublime
to
know
it
by
experience
and
be
able
to
give
a
true
account
of
it
in
my
next
excursion
for
most
men
it
appears
to
me
are
in
a
strange
uncertainty
about
it
whether
it
is
of
the
devil
or
of
god
and
have
somewhat
hastily
concluded
that
it
is
the
chief
end
of
man
here
to
glorify
god
and
enjoy
him
forever
still
we
live
meanly
like
ants
though
the
fable
tells
us
that
we
were
long
ago
changed
into
men
like
pygmies
we
fight
with
cranes
it
is
error
upon
error
and
clout
upon
clout
and
our
best
virtue
has
for
its
occasion
a
superfluous
and
evitable
wretchedness
our
life
is
frittered
away
by
detail
an
honest
man
has
hardly
need
to
count
more
than
his
ten
fingers
or
in
extreme
cases
he
may
add
his
ten
toes
and
lump
the
rest
simplicity
simplicity
simplicity
i
say
let
your
affairs
be
as
two
or
three
and
not
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
instead
of
a
million
count
half
a
dozen
and
keep
your
accounts
on
your
thumb
nail
in
the
midst
of
this
chopping
sea
of
civilized
life
such
are
the
clouds
and
storms
and
quicksands
and
thousand
and
one
items
to
be
allowed
for
that
a
man
has
to
live
if
he
would
not
founder
and
go
to
the
bottom
and
not
make
his
port
at
all
by
dead
reckoning
and
he
must
be
a
great
calculator
indeed
who
succeeds
simplify
simplify
instead
of
three
meals
a
day
if
it
be
necessary
eat
but
one
instead
of
a
hundred
dishes
five
and
reduce
other
things
in
proportion
our
life
is
like
a
german
confederacy
made
up
of
petty
states
with
its
boundary
forever
fluctuating
so
that
even
a
german
cannot
tell
you
how
it
is
bounded
at
any
moment
the
nation
itself
with
all
its
so
called
internal
improvements
which
by
the
way
are
all
external
and
superficial
is
just
such
an
unwieldy
and
overgrown
establishment
cluttered
with
furniture
and
tripped
up
by
its
own
traps
ruined
by
luxury
and
heedless
expense
by
want
of
calculation
and
a
worthy
aim
as
the
million
households
in
the
land
and
the
only
cure
for
it
as
for
them
is
in
a
rigid
economy
a
stern
and
more
than
spartan
simplicity
of
life
and
elevation
of
purpose
it
lives
too
fast
men
think
that
it
is
essential
that
the
nation
have
commerce
and
export
ice
and
talk
through
a
telegraph
and
ride
thirty
miles
an
hour
without
a
doubt
whether
they
do
or
not
but
whether
we
should
live
like
baboons
or
like
men
is
a
little
uncertain
if
we
do
not
get
out
sleepers
and
forge
rails
and
devote
days
and
nights
to
the
work
but
go
to
tinkering
upon
our
lives
to
improve
them
who
will
build
railroads
and
if
railroads
are
not
built
how
shall
we
get
to
heaven
in
season
but
if
we
stay
at
home
and
mind
our
business
who
will
want
railroads
we
do
not
ride
on
the
railroad
it
rides
upon
us
did
you
ever
think
what
those
sleepers
are
that
underlie
the
railroad
each
one
is
a
man
an
irishman
or
a
yankee
man
the
rails
are
laid
on
them
and
they
are
covered
with
sand
and
the
cars
run
smoothly
over
them
they
are
sound
sleepers
i
assure
you
and
every
few
years
a
new
lot
is
laid
down
and
run
over
so
that
if
some
have
the
pleasure
of
riding
on
a
rail
others
have
the
misfortune
to
be
ridden
upon
and
when
they
run
over
a
man
that
is
walking
in
his
sleep
a
supernumerary
sleeper
in
the
wrong
position
and
wake
him
up
they
suddenly
stop
the
cars
and
make
a
hue
and
cry
about
it
as
if
this
were
an
exception
i
am
glad
to
know
that
it
takes
a
gang
of
men
for
every
five
miles
to
keep
the
sleepers
down
and
level
in
their
beds
as
it
is
for
this
is
a
sign
that
they
may
sometime
get
up
again
why
should
we
live
with
such
hurry
and
waste
of
life
we
are
determined
to
be
starved
before
we
are
hungry
men
say
that
a
stitch
in
time
saves
nine
and
so
they
take
a
thousand
stitches
today
to
save
nine
tomorrow
as
for
work
we
haven
t
any
of
any
consequence
we
have
the
saint
vitus
dance
and
cannot
possibly
keep
our
heads
still
if
i
should
only
give
a
few
pulls
at
the
parish
bell
rope
as
for
a
fire
that
is
without
setting
the
bell
there
is
hardly
a
man
on
his
farm
in
the
outskirts
of
concord
notwithstanding
that
press
of
engagements
which
was
his
excuse
so
many
times
this
morning
nor
a
boy
nor
a
woman
i
might
almost
say
but
would
forsake
all
and
follow
that
sound
not
mainly
to
save
property
from
the
flames
but
if
we
will
confess
the
truth
much
more
to
see
it
burn
since
burn
it
must
and
we
be
it
known
did
not
set
it
on
fire
or
to
see
it
put
out
and
have
a
hand
in
it
if
that
is
done
as
handsomely
yes
even
if
it
were
the
parish
church
itself
hardly
a
man
takes
a
half
hour
s
nap
after
dinner
but
when
he
wakes
he
holds
up
his
head
and
asks
what
s
the
news
as
if
the
rest
of
mankind
had
stood
his
sentinels
some
give
directions
to
be
waked
every
half
hour
doubtless
for
no
other
purpose
and
then
to
pay
for
it
they
tell
what
they
have
dreamed
after
a
night
s
sleep
the
news
is
as
indispensable
as
the
breakfast
pray
tell
me
anything
new
that
has
happened
to
a
man
anywhere
on
this
globe
and
he
reads
it
over
his
coffee
and
rolls
that
a
man
has
had
his
eyes
gouged
out
this
morning
on
the
wachito
river
never
dreaming
the
while
that
he
lives
in
the
dark
unfathomed
mammoth
cave
of
this
world
and
has
but
the
rudiment
of
an
eye
himself
for
my
part
i
could
easily
do
without
the
post
office
i
think
that
there
are
very
few
important
communications
made
through
it
to
speak
critically
i
never
received
more
than
one
or
two
letters
in
my
life
i
wrote
this
some
years
ago
that
were
worth
the
postage
the
penny
post
is
commonly
an
institution
through
which
you
seriously
offer
a
man
that
penny
for
his
thoughts
which
is
so
often
safely
offered
in
jest
and
i
am
sure
that
i
never
read
any
memorable
news
in
a
newspaper
if
we
read
of
one
man
robbed
or
murdered
or
killed
by
accident
or
one
house
burned
or
one
vessel
wrecked
or
one
steamboat
blown
up
or
one
cow
run
over
on
the
western
railroad
or
one
mad
dog
killed
or
one
lot
of
grasshoppers
in
the
winter
we
never
need
read
of
another
one
is
enough
if
you
are
acquainted
with
the
principle
what
do
you
care
for
a
myriad
instances
and
applications
to
a
philosopher
all
news
as
it
is
called
is
gossip
and
they
who
edit
and
read
it
are
old
women
over
their
tea
yet
not
a
few
are
greedy
after
this
gossip
there
was
such
a
rush
as
i
hear
the
other
day
at
one
of
the
offices
to
learn
the
foreign
news
by
the
last
arrival
that
several
large
squares
of
plate
glass
belonging
to
the
establishment
were
broken
by
the
pressure
news
which
i
seriously
think
a
ready
wit
might
write
a
twelve
month
or
twelve
years
beforehand
with
sufficient
accuracy
as
for
spain
for
instance
if
you
know
how
to
throw
in
don
carlos
and
the
infanta
and
don
pedro
and
seville
and
granada
from
time
to
time
in
the
right
proportions
they
may
have
changed
the
names
a
little
since
i
saw
the
papers
and
serve
up
a
bull
fight
when
other
entertainments
fail
it
will
be
true
to
the
letter
and
give
us
as
good
an
idea
of
the
exact
state
or
ruin
of
things
in
spain
as
the
most
succinct
and
lucid
reports
under
this
head
in
the
newspapers
and
as
for
england
almost
the
last
significant
scrap
of
news
from
that
quarter
was
the
revolution
of
1649
and
if
you
have
learned
the
history
of
her
crops
for
an
average
year
you
never
need
attend
to
that
thing
again
unless
your
speculations
are
of
a
merely
pecuniary
character
if
one
may
judge
who
rarely
looks
into
the
newspapers
nothing
new
does
ever
happen
in
foreign
parts
a
french
revolution
not
excepted
what
news
how
much
more
important
to
know
what
that
is
which
was
never
old
kieou
he
yu
great
dignitary
of
the
state
of
wei
sent
a
man
to
khoung
tseu
to
know
his
news
khoung
tseu
caused
the
messenger
to
be
seated
near
him
and
questioned
him
in
these
terms
what
is
your
master
doing
the
messenger
answered
with
respect
my
master
desires
to
diminish
the
number
of
his
faults
but
he
cannot
come
to
the
end
of
them
the
messenger
being
gone
the
philosopher
remarked
what
a
worthy
messenger
what
a
worthy
messenger
the
preacher
instead
of
vexing
the
ears
of
drowsy
farmers
on
their
day
of
rest
at
the
end
of
the
week
for
sunday
is
the
fit
conclusion
of
an
ill
spent
week
and
not
the
fresh
and
brave
beginning
of
a
new
one
with
this
one
other
draggle
tail
of
a
sermon
should
shout
with
thundering
voice
pause
avast
why
so
seeming
fast
but
deadly
slow
shams
and
delusions
are
esteemed
for
soundest
truths
while
reality
is
fabulous
if
men
would
steadily
observe
realities
only
and
not
allow
themselves
to
be
deluded
life
to
compare
it
with
such
things
as
we
know
would
be
like
a
fairy
tale
and
the
arabian
nights
entertainments
if
we
respected
only
what
is
inevitable
and
has
a
right
to
be
music
and
poetry
would
resound
along
the
streets
when
we
are
unhurried
and
wise
we
perceive
that
only
great
and
worthy
things
have
any
permanent
and
absolute
existence
that
petty
fears
and
petty
pleasures
are
but
the
shadow
of
the
reality
this
is
always
exhilarating
and
sublime
by
closing
the
eyes
and
slumbering
and
consenting
to
be
deceived
by
shows
men
establish
and
confirm
their
daily
life
of
routine
and
habit
everywhere
which
still
is
built
on
purely
illusory
foundations
children
who
play
life
discern
its
true
law
and
relations
more
clearly
than
men
who
fail
to
live
it
worthily
but
who
think
that
they
are
wiser
by
experience
that
is
by
failure
i
have
read
in
a
hindoo
book
that
there
was
a
king
s
son
who
being
expelled
in
infancy
from
his
native
city
was
brought
up
by
a
forester
and
growing
up
to
maturity
in
that
state
imagined
himself
to
belong
to
the
barbarous
race
with
which
he
lived
one
of
his
father
s
ministers
having
discovered
him
revealed
to
him
what
he
was
and
the
misconception
of
his
character
was
removed
and
he
knew
himself
to
be
a
prince
so
soul
continues
the
hindoo
philosopher
from
the
circumstances
in
which
it
is
placed
mistakes
its
own
character
until
the
truth
is
revealed
to
it
by
some
holy
teacher
and
then
it
knows
itself
to
be
brahme
i
perceive
that
we
inhabitants
of
new
england
live
this
mean
life
that
we
do
because
our
vision
does
not
penetrate
the
surface
of
things
we
think
that
that
is
which
appears
to
be
if
a
man
should
walk
through
this
town
and
see
only
the
reality
where
think
you
would
the
mill
dam
go
to
if
he
should
give
us
an
account
of
the
realities
he
beheld
there
we
should
not
recognize
the
place
in
his
description
look
at
a
meeting
house
or
a
court
house
or
a
jail
or
a
shop
or
a
dwelling
house
and
say
what
that
thing
really
is
before
a
true
gaze
and
they
would
all
go
to
pieces
in
your
account
of
them
men
esteem
truth
remote
in
the
outskirts
of
the
system
behind
the
farthest
star
before
adam
and
after
the
last
man
in
eternity
there
is
indeed
something
true
and
sublime
but
all
these
times
and
places
and
occasions
are
now
and
here
god
himself
culminates
in
the
present
moment
and
will
never
be
more
divine
in
the
lapse
of
all
the
ages
and
we
are
enabled
to
apprehend
at
all
what
is
sublime
and
noble
only
by
the
perpetual
instilling
and
drenching
of
the
reality
that
surrounds
us
the
universe
constantly
and
obediently
answers
to
our
conceptions
whether
we
travel
fast
or
slow
the
track
is
laid
for
us
let
us
spend
our
lives
in
conceiving
then
the
poet
or
the
artist
never
yet
had
so
fair
and
noble
a
design
but
some
of
his
posterity
at
least
could
accomplish
it
let
us
spend
one
day
as
deliberately
as
nature
and
not
be
thrown
off
the
track
by
every
nutshell
and
mosquito
s
wing
that
falls
on
the
rails
let
us
rise
early
and
fast
or
break
fast
gently
and
without
perturbation
let
company
come
and
let
company
go
let
the
bells
ring
and
the
children
cry
determined
to
make
a
day
of
it
why
should
we
knock
under
and
go
with
the
stream
let
us
not
be
upset
and
overwhelmed
in
that
terrible
rapid
and
whirlpool
called
a
dinner
situated
in
the
meridian
shallows
weather
this
danger
and
you
are
safe
for
the
rest
of
the
way
is
down
hill
with
unrelaxed
nerves
with
morning
vigor
sail
by
it
looking
another
way
tied
to
the
mast
like
ulysses
if
the
engine
whistles
let
it
whistle
till
it
is
hoarse
for
its
pains
if
the
bell
rings
why
should
we
run
we
will
consider
what
kind
of
music
they
are
like
let
us
settle
ourselves
and
work
and
wedge
our
feet
downward
through
the
mud
and
slush
of
opinion
and
prejudice
and
tradition
and
delusion
and
appearance
that
alluvion
which
covers
the
globe
through
paris
and
london
through
new
york
and
boston
and
concord
through
church
and
state
through
poetry
and
philosophy
and
religion
till
we
come
to
a
hard
bottom
and
rocks
in
place
which
we
can
call
reality
and
say
this
is
and
no
mistake
and
then
begin
having
a
point
d
appui
below
freshet
and
frost
and
fire
a
place
where
you
might
found
a
wall
or
a
state
or
set
a
lamp
post
safely
or
perhaps
a
gauge
not
a
nilometer
but
a
realometer
that
future
ages
might
know
how
deep
a
freshet
of
shams
and
appearances
had
gathered
from
time
to
time
if
you
stand
right
fronting
and
face
to
face
to
a
fact
you
will
see
the
sun
glimmer
on
both
its
surfaces
as
if
it
were
a
cimeter
and
feel
its
sweet
edge
dividing
you
through
the
heart
and
marrow
and
so
you
will
happily
conclude
your
mortal
career
be
it
life
or
death
we
crave
only
reality
if
we
are
really
dying
let
us
hear
the
rattle
in
our
throats
and
feel
cold
in
the
extremities
if
we
are
alive
let
us
go
about
our
business
time
is
but
the
stream
i
go
a
fishing
in
i
drink
at
it
but
while
i
drink
i
see
the
sandy
bottom
and
detect
how
shallow
it
is
its
thin
current
slides
away
but
eternity
remains
i
would
drink
deeper
fish
in
the
sky
whose
bottom
is
pebbly
with
stars
i
cannot
count
one
i
know
not
the
first
letter
of
the
alphabet
i
have
always
been
regretting
that
i
was
not
as
wise
as
the
day
i
was
born
the
intellect
is
a
cleaver
it
discerns
and
rifts
its
way
into
the
secret
of
things
i
do
not
wish
to
be
any
more
busy
with
my
hands
than
is
necessary
my
head
is
hands
and
feet
i
feel
all
my
best
faculties
concentrated
in
it
my
instinct
tells
me
that
my
head
is
an
organ
for
burrowing
as
some
creatures
use
their
snout
and
fore
paws
and
with
it
i
would
mine
and
burrow
my
way
through
these
hills
i
think
that
the
richest
vein
is
somewhere
hereabouts
so
by
the
divining
rod
and
thin
rising
vapors
i
judge
and
here
i
will
begin
to
mine
reading
with
a
little
more
deliberation
in
the
choice
of
their
pursuits
all
men
would
perhaps
become
essentially
students
and
observers
for
certainly
their
nature
and
destiny
are
interesting
to
all
alike
in
accumulating
property
for
ourselves
or
our
posterity
in
founding
a
family
or
a
state
or
acquiring
fame
even
we
are
mortal
but
in
dealing
with
truth
we
are
immortal
and
need
fear
no
change
nor
accident
the
oldest
egyptian
or
hindoo
philosopher
raised
a
corner
of
the
veil
from
the
statue
of
the
divinity
and
still
the
trembling
robe
remains
raised
and
i
gaze
upon
as
fresh
a
glory
as
he
did
since
it
was
i
in
him
that
was
then
so
bold
and
it
is
he
in
me
that
now
reviews
the
vision
no
dust
has
settled
on
that
robe
no
time
has
elapsed
since
that
divinity
was
revealed
that
time
which
we
really
improve
or
which
is
improvable
is
neither
past
present
nor
future
my
residence
was
more
favorable
not
only
to
thought
but
to
serious
reading
than
a
university
and
though
i
was
beyond
the
range
of
the
ordinary
circulating
library
i
had
more
than
ever
come
within
the
influence
of
those
books
which
circulate
round
the
world
whose
sentences
were
first
written
on
bark
and
are
now
merely
copied
from
time
to
time
on
to
linen
paper
says
the
poet
m
r
camar
udd
n
mast
being
seated
to
run
through
the
region
of
the
spiritual
world
i
have
had
this
advantage
in
books
to
be
intoxicated
by
a
single
glass
of
wine
i
have
experienced
this
pleasure
when
i
have
drunk
the
liquor
of
the
esoteric
doctrines
i
kept
homer
s
iliad
on
my
table
through
the
summer
though
i
looked
at
his
page
only
now
and
then
incessant
labor
with
my
hands
at
first
for
i
had
my
house
to
finish
and
my
beans
to
hoe
at
the
same
time
made
more
study
impossible
yet
i
sustained
myself
by
the
prospect
of
such
reading
in
future
i
read
one
or
two
shallow
books
of
travel
in
the
intervals
of
my
work
till
that
employment
made
me
ashamed
of
myself
and
i
asked
where
it
was
then
that
i
lived
the
student
may
read
homer
or
schylus
in
the
greek
without
danger
of
dissipation
or
luxuriousness
for
it
implies
that
he
in
some
measure
emulate
their
heroes
and
consecrate
morning
hours
to
their
pages
the
heroic
books
even
if
printed
in
the
character
of
our
mother
tongue
will
always
be
in
a
language
dead
to
degenerate
times
and
we
must
laboriously
seek
the
meaning
of
each
word
and
line
conjecturing
a
larger
sense
than
common
use
permits
out
of
what
wisdom
and
valor
and
generosity
we
have
the
modern
cheap
and
fertile
press
with
all
its
translations
has
done
little
to
bring
us
nearer
to
the
heroic
writers
of
antiquity
they
seem
as
solitary
and
the
letter
in
which
they
are
printed
as
rare
and
curious
as
ever
it
is
worth
the
expense
of
youthful
days
and
costly
hours
if
you
learn
only
some
words
of
an
ancient
language
which
are
raised
out
of
the
trivialness
of
the
street
to
be
perpetual
suggestions
and
provocations
it
is
not
in
vain
that
the
farmer
remembers
and
repeats
the
few
latin
words
which
he
has
heard
men
sometimes
speak
as
if
the
study
of
the
classics
would
at
length
make
way
for
more
modern
and
practical
studies
but
the
adventurous
student
will
always
study
classics
in
whatever
language
they
may
be
written
and
however
ancient
they
may
be
for
what
are
the
classics
but
the
noblest
recorded
thoughts
of
man
they
are
the
only
oracles
which
are
not
decayed
and
there
are
such
answers
to
the
most
modern
inquiry
in
them
as
delphi
and
dodona
never
gave
we
might
as
well
omit
to
study
nature
because
she
is
old
to
read
well
that
is
to
read
true
books
in
a
true
spirit
is
a
noble
exercise
and
one
that
will
task
the
reader
more
than
any
exercise
which
the
customs
of
the
day
esteem
it
requires
a
training
such
as
the
athletes
underwent
the
steady
intention
almost
of
the
whole
life
to
this
object
books
must
be
read
as
deliberately
and
reservedly
as
they
were
written
it
is
not
enough
even
to
be
able
to
speak
the
language
of
that
nation
by
which
they
are
written
for
there
is
a
memorable
interval
between
the
spoken
and
the
written
language
the
language
heard
and
the
language
read
the
one
is
commonly
transitory
a
sound
a
tongue
a
dialect
merely
almost
brutish
and
we
learn
it
unconsciously
like
the
brutes
of
our
mothers
the
other
is
the
maturity
and
experience
of
that
if
that
is
our
mother
tongue
this
is
our
father
tongue
a
reserved
and
select
expression
too
significant
to
be
heard
by
the
ear
which
we
must
be
born
again
in
order
to
speak
the
crowds
of
men
who
merely
spoke
the
greek
and
latin
tongues
in
the
middle
ages
were
not
entitled
by
the
accident
of
birth
to
read
the
works
of
genius
written
in
those
languages
for
these
were
not
written
in
that
greek
or
latin
which
they
knew
but
in
the
select
language
of
literature
they
had
not
learned
the
nobler
dialects
of
greece
and
rome
but
the
very
materials
on
which
they
were
written
were
waste
paper
to
them
and
they
prized
instead
a
cheap
contemporary
literature
but
when
the
several
nations
of
europe
had
acquired
distinct
though
rude
written
languages
of
their
own
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
their
rising
literatures
then
first
learning
revived
and
scholars
were
enabled
to
discern
from
that
remoteness
the
treasures
of
antiquity
what
the
roman
and
grecian
multitude
could
not
hear
after
the
lapse
of
ages
a
few
scholars
read
and
a
few
scholars
only
are
still
reading
it
however
much
we
may
admire
the
orator
s
occasional
bursts
of
eloquence
the
noblest
written
words
are
commonly
as
far
behind
or
above
the
fleeting
spoken
language
as
the
firmament
with
its
stars
is
behind
the
clouds
there
are
the
stars
and
they
who
can
may
read
them
the
astronomers
forever
comment
on
and
observe
them
they
are
not
exhalations
like
our
daily
colloquies
and
vaporous
breath
what
is
called
eloquence
in
the
forum
is
commonly
found
to
be
rhetoric
in
the
study
the
orator
yields
to
the
inspiration
of
a
transient
occasion
and
speaks
to
the
mob
before
him
to
those
who
can
hear
him
but
the
writer
whose
more
equable
life
is
his
occasion
and
who
would
be
distracted
by
the
event
and
the
crowd
which
inspire
the
orator
speaks
to
the
intellect
and
health
of
mankind
to
all
in
any
age
who
can
understand
him
no
wonder
that
alexander
carried
the
iliad
with
him
on
his
expeditions
in
a
precious
casket
a
written
word
is
the
choicest
of
relics
it
is
something
at
once
more
intimate
with
us
and
more
universal
than
any
other
work
of
art
it
is
the
work
of
art
nearest
to
life
itself
it
may
be
translated
into
every
language
and
not
only
be
read
but
actually
breathed
from
all
human
lips
not
be
represented
on
canvas
or
in
marble
only
but
be
carved
out
of
the
breath
of
life
itself
the
symbol
of
an
ancient
man
s
thought
becomes
a
modern
man
s
speech
two
thousand
summers
have
imparted
to
the
monuments
of
grecian
literature
as
to
her
marbles
only
a
maturer
golden
and
autumnal
tint
for
they
have
carried
their
own
serene
and
celestial
atmosphere
into
all
lands
to
protect
them
against
the
corrosion
of
time
books
are
the
treasured
wealth
of
the
world
and
the
fit
inheritance
of
generations
and
nations
books
the
oldest
and
the
best
stand
naturally
and
rightfully
on
the
shelves
of
every
cottage
they
have
no
cause
of
their
own
to
plead
but
while
they
enlighten
and
sustain
the
reader
his
common
sense
will
not
refuse
them
their
authors
are
a
natural
and
irresistible
aristocracy
in
every
society
and
more
than
kings
or
emperors
exert
an
influence
on
mankind
when
the
illiterate
and
perhaps
scornful
trader
has
earned
by
enterprise
and
industry
his
coveted
leisure
and
independence
and
is
admitted
to
the
circles
of
wealth
and
fashion
he
turns
inevitably
at
last
to
those
still
higher
but
yet
inaccessible
circles
of
intellect
and
genius
and
is
sensible
only
of
the
imperfection
of
his
culture
and
the
vanity
and
insufficiency
of
all
his
riches
and
further
proves
his
good
sense
by
the
pains
which
he
takes
to
secure
for
his
children
that
intellectual
culture
whose
want
he
so
keenly
feels
and
thus
it
is
that
he
becomes
the
founder
of
a
family
those
who
have
not
learned
to
read
the
ancient
classics
in
the
language
in
which
they
were
written
must
have
a
very
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
human
race
for
it
is
remarkable
that
no
transcript
of
them
has
ever
been
made
into
any
modern
tongue
unless
our
civilization
itself
may
be
regarded
as
such
a
transcript
homer
has
never
yet
been
printed
in
english
nor
schylus
nor
virgil
even
works
as
refined
as
solidly
done
and
as
beautiful
almost
as
the
morning
itself
for
later
writers
say
what
we
will
of
their
genius
have
rarely
if
ever
equalled
the
elaborate
beauty
and
finish
and
the
lifelong
and
heroic
literary
labors
of
the
ancients
they
only
talk
of
forgetting
them
who
never
knew
them
it
will
be
soon
enough
to
forget
them
when
we
have
the
learning
and
the
genius
which
will
enable
us
to
attend
to
and
appreciate
them
that
age
will
be
rich
indeed
when
those
relics
which
we
call
classics
and
the
still
older
and
more
than
classic
but
even
less
known
scriptures
of
the
nations
shall
have
still
further
accumulated
when
the
vaticans
shall
be
filled
with
vedas
and
zendavestas
and
bibles
with
homers
and
dantes
and
shakespeares
and
all
the
centuries
to
come
shall
have
successively
deposited
their
trophies
in
the
forum
of
the
world
by
such
a
pile
we
may
hope
to
scale
heaven
at
last
the
works
of
the
great
poets
have
never
yet
been
read
by
mankind
for
only
great
poets
can
read
them
they
have
only
been
read
as
the
multitude
read
the
stars
at
most
astrologically
not
astronomically
most
men
have
learned
to
read
to
serve
a
paltry
convenience
as
they
have
learned
to
cipher
in
order
to
keep
accounts
and
not
be
cheated
in
trade
but
of
reading
as
a
noble
intellectual
exercise
they
know
little
or
nothing
yet
this
only
is
reading
in
a
high
sense
not
that
which
lulls
us
as
a
luxury
and
suffers
the
nobler
faculties
to
sleep
the
while
but
what
we
have
to
stand
on
tip
toe
to
read
and
devote
our
most
alert
and
wakeful
hours
to
i
think
that
having
learned
our
letters
we
should
read
the
best
that
is
in
literature
and
not
be
forever
repeating
our
a
b
abs
and
words
of
one
syllable
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
classes
sitting
on
the
lowest
and
foremost
form
all
our
lives
most
men
are
satisfied
if
they
read
or
hear
read
and
perchance
have
been
convicted
by
the
wisdom
of
one
good
book
the
bible
and
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
vegetate
and
dissipate
their
faculties
in
what
is
called
easy
reading
there
is
a
work
in
several
volumes
in
our
circulating
library
entitled
little
reading
which
i
thought
referred
to
a
town
of
that
name
which
i
had
not
been
to
there
are
those
who
like
cormorants
and
ostriches
can
digest
all
sorts
of
this
even
after
the
fullest
dinner
of
meats
and
vegetables
for
they
suffer
nothing
to
be
wasted
if
others
are
the
machines
to
provide
this
provender
they
are
the
machines
to
read
it
they
read
the
nine
thousandth
tale
about
zebulon
and
sophronia
and
how
they
loved
as
none
had
ever
loved
before
and
neither
did
the
course
of
their
true
love
run
smooth
at
any
rate
how
it
did
run
and
stumble
and
get
up
again
and
go
on
how
some
poor
unfortunate
got
up
on
to
a
steeple
who
had
better
never
have
gone
up
as
far
as
the
belfry
and
then
having
needlessly
got
him
up
there
the
happy
novelist
rings
the
bell
for
all
the
world
to
come
together
and
hear
o
dear
how
he
did
get
down
again
for
my
part
i
think
that
they
had
better
metamorphose
all
such
aspiring
heroes
of
universal
noveldom
into
man
weather
cocks
as
they
used
to
put
heroes
among
the
constellations
and
let
them
swing
round
there
till
they
are
rusty
and
not
come
down
at
all
to
bother
honest
men
with
their
pranks
the
next
time
the
novelist
rings
the
bell
i
will
not
stir
though
the
meeting
house
burn
down
the
skip
of
the
tip
toe
hop
a
romance
of
the
middle
ages
by
the
celebrated
author
of
tittle
tol
tan
to
appear
in
monthly
parts
a
great
rush
don
t
all
come
together
all
this
they
read
with
saucer
eyes
and
erect
and
primitive
curiosity
and
with
unwearied
gizzard
whose
corrugations
even
yet
need
no
sharpening
just
as
some
little
four
year
old
bencher
his
two
cent
gilt
covered
edition
of
cinderella
without
any
improvement
that
i
can
see
in
the
pronunciation
or
accent
or
emphasis
or
any
more
skill
in
extracting
or
inserting
the
moral
the
result
is
dulness
of
sight
a
stagnation
of
the
vital
circulations
and
a
general
deliquium
and
sloughing
off
of
all
the
intellectual
faculties
this
sort
of
gingerbread
is
baked
daily
and
more
sedulously
than
pure
wheat
or
rye
and
indian
in
almost
every
oven
and
finds
a
surer
market
the
best
books
are
not
read
even
by
those
who
are
called
good
readers
what
does
our
concord
culture
amount
to
there
is
in
this
town
with
a
very
few
exceptions
no
taste
for
the
best
or
for
very
good
books
even
in
english
literature
whose
words
all
can
read
and
spell
even
the
college
bred
and
so
called
liberally
educated
men
here
and
elsewhere
have
really
little
or
no
acquaintance
with
the
english
classics
and
as
for
the
recorded
wisdom
of
mankind
the
ancient
classics
and
bibles
which
are
accessible
to
all
who
will
know
of
them
there
are
the
feeblest
efforts
anywhere
made
to
become
acquainted
with
them
i
know
a
woodchopper
of
middle
age
who
takes
a
french
paper
not
for
news
as
he
says
for
he
is
above
that
but
to
keep
himself
in
practice
he
being
a
canadian
by
birth
and
when
i
ask
him
what
he
considers
the
best
thing
he
can
do
in
this
world
he
says
beside
this
to
keep
up
and
add
to
his
english
this
is
about
as
much
as
the
college
bred
generally
do
or
aspire
to
do
and
they
take
an
english
paper
for
the
purpose
one
who
has
just
come
from
reading
perhaps
one
of
the
best
english
books
will
find
how
many
with
whom
he
can
converse
about
it
or
suppose
he
comes
from
reading
a
greek
or
latin
classic
in
the
original
whose
praises
are
familiar
even
to
the
so
called
illiterate
he
will
find
nobody
at
all
to
speak
to
but
must
keep
silence
about
it
indeed
there
is
hardly
the
professor
in
our
colleges
who
if
he
has
mastered
the
difficulties
of
the
language
has
proportionally
mastered
the
difficulties
of
the
wit
and
poetry
of
a
greek
poet
and
has
any
sympathy
to
impart
to
the
alert
and
heroic
reader
and
as
for
the
sacred
scriptures
or
bibles
of
mankind
who
in
this
town
can
tell
me
even
their
titles
most
men
do
not
know
that
any
nation
but
the
hebrews
have
had
a
scripture
a
man
any
man
will
go
considerably
out
of
his
way
to
pick
up
a
silver
dollar
but
here
are
golden
words
which
the
wisest
men
of
antiquity
have
uttered
and
whose
worth
the
wise
of
every
succeeding
age
have
assured
us
of
and
yet
we
learn
to
read
only
as
far
as
easy
reading
the
primers
and
class
books
and
when
we
leave
school
the
little
reading
and
story
books
which
are
for
boys
and
beginners
and
our
reading
our
conversation
and
thinking
are
all
on
a
very
low
level
worthy
only
of
pygmies
and
manikins
i
aspire
to
be
acquainted
with
wiser
men
than
this
our
concord
soil
has
produced
whose
names
are
hardly
known
here
or
shall
i
hear
the
name
of
plato
and
never
read
his
book
as
if
plato
were
my
townsman
and
i
never
saw
him
my
next
neighbor
and
i
never
heard
him
speak
or
attended
to
the
wisdom
of
his
words
but
how
actually
is
it
his
dialogues
which
contain
what
was
immortal
in
him
lie
on
the
next
shelf
and
yet
i
never
read
them
we
are
underbred
and
low
lived
and
illiterate
and
in
this
respect
i
confess
i
do
not
make
any
very
broad
distinction
between
the
illiterateness
of
my
townsman
who
cannot
read
at
all
and
the
illiterateness
of
him
who
has
learned
to
read
only
what
is
for
children
and
feeble
intellects
we
should
be
as
good
as
the
worthies
of
antiquity
but
partly
by
first
knowing
how
good
they
were
we
are
a
race
of
tit
men
and
soar
but
little
higher
in
our
intellectual
flights
than
the
columns
of
the
daily
paper
it
is
not
all
books
that
are
as
dull
as
their
readers
there
are
probably
words
addressed
to
our
condition
exactly
which
if
we
could
really
hear
and
understand
would
be
more
salutary
than
the
morning
or
the
spring
to
our
lives
and
possibly
put
a
new
aspect
on
the
face
of
things
for
us
how
many
a
man
has
dated
a
new
era
in
his
life
from
the
reading
of
a
book
the
book
exists
for
us
perchance
which
will
explain
our
miracles
and
reveal
new
ones
the
at
present
unutterable
things
we
may
find
somewhere
uttered
these
same
questions
that
disturb
and
puzzle
and
confound
us
have
in
their
turn
occurred
to
all
the
wise
men
not
one
has
been
omitted
and
each
has
answered
them
according
to
his
ability
by
his
words
and
his
life
moreover
with
wisdom
we
shall
learn
liberality
the
solitary
hired
man
on
a
farm
in
the
outskirts
of
concord
who
has
had
his
second
birth
and
peculiar
religious
experience
and
is
driven
as
he
believes
into
the
silent
gravity
and
exclusiveness
by
his
faith
may
think
it
is
not
true
but
zoroaster
thousands
of
years
ago
travelled
the
same
road
and
had
the
same
experience
but
he
being
wise
knew
it
to
be
universal
and
treated
his
neighbors
accordingly
and
is
even
said
to
have
invented
and
established
worship
among
men
let
him
humbly
commune
with
zoroaster
then
and
through
the
liberalizing
influence
of
all
the
worthies
with
jesus
christ
himself
and
let
our
church
go
by
the
board
we
boast
that
we
belong
to
the
nineteenth
century
and
are
making
the
most
rapid
strides
of
any
nation
but
consider
how
little
this
village
does
for
its
own
culture
i
do
not
wish
to
flatter
my
townsmen
nor
to
be
flattered
by
them
for
that
will
not
advance
either
of
us
we
need
to
be
provoked
goaded
like
oxen
as
we
are
into
a
trot
we
have
a
comparatively
decent
system
of
common
schools
schools
for
infants
only
but
excepting
the
half
starved
lyceum
in
the
winter
and
latterly
the
puny
beginning
of
a
library
suggested
by
the
state
no
school
for
ourselves
we
spend
more
on
almost
any
article
of
bodily
aliment
or
ailment
than
on
our
mental
aliment
it
is
time
that
we
had
uncommon
schools
that
we
did
not
leave
off
our
education
when
we
begin
to
be
men
and
women
it
is
time
that
villages
were
universities
and
their
elder
inhabitants
the
fellows
of
universities
with
leisure
if
they
are
indeed
so
well
off
to
pursue
liberal
studies
the
rest
of
their
lives
shall
the
world
be
confined
to
one
paris
or
one
oxford
forever
cannot
students
be
boarded
here
and
get
a
liberal
education
under
the
skies
of
concord
can
we
not
hire
some
abelard
to
lecture
to
us
alas
what
with
foddering
the
cattle
and
tending
the
store
we
are
kept
from
school
too
long
and
our
education
is
sadly
neglected
in
this
country
the
village
should
in
some
respects
take
the
place
of
the
nobleman
of
europe
it
should
be
the
patron
of
the
fine
arts
it
is
rich
enough
it
wants
only
the
magnanimity
and
refinement
it
can
spend
money
enough
on
such
things
as
farmers
and
traders
value
but
it
is
thought
utopian
to
propose
spending
money
for
things
which
more
intelligent
men
know
to
be
of
far
more
worth
this
town
has
spent
seventeen
thousand
dollars
on
a
town
house
thank
fortune
or
politics
but
probably
it
will
not
spend
so
much
on
living
wit
the
true
meat
to
put
into
that
shell
in
a
hundred
years
the
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
dollars
annually
subscribed
for
a
lyceum
in
the
winter
is
better
spent
than
any
other
equal
sum
raised
in
the
town
if
we
live
in
the
nineteenth
century
why
should
we
not
enjoy
the
advantages
which
the
nineteenth
century
offers
why
should
our
life
be
in
any
respect
provincial
if
we
will
read
newspapers
why
not
skip
the
gossip
of
boston
and
take
the
best
newspaper
in
the
world
at
once
not
be
sucking
the
pap
of
neutral
family
papers
or
browsing
olive
branches
here
in
new
england
let
the
reports
of
all
the
learned
societies
come
to
us
and
we
will
see
if
they
know
anything
why
should
we
leave
it
to
harper
brothers
and
redding
co
to
select
our
reading
as
the
nobleman
of
cultivated
taste
surrounds
himself
with
whatever
conduces
to
his
culture
genius
learning
wit
books
paintings
statuary
music
philosophical
instruments
and
the
like
so
let
the
village
do
not
stop
short
at
a
pedagogue
a
parson
a
sexton
a
parish
library
and
three
selectmen
because
our
pilgrim
forefathers
got
through
a
cold
winter
once
on
a
bleak
rock
with
these
to
act
collectively
is
according
to
the
spirit
of
our
institutions
and
i
am
confident
that
as
our
circumstances
are
more
flourishing
our
means
are
greater
than
the
nobleman
s
new
england
can
hire
all
the
wise
men
in
the
world
to
come
and
teach
her
and
board
them
round
the
while
and
not
be
provincial
at
all
that
is
the
uncommon
school
we
want
instead
of
noblemen
let
us
have
noble
villages
of
men
if
it
is
necessary
omit
one
bridge
over
the
river
go
round
a
little
there
and
throw
one
arch
at
least
over
the
darker
gulf
of
ignorance
which
surrounds
us
sounds
but
while
we
are
confined
to
books
though
the
most
select
and
classic
and
read
only
particular
written
languages
which
are
themselves
but
dialects
and
provincial
we
are
in
danger
of
forgetting
the
language
which
all
things
and
events
speak
without
metaphor
which
alone
is
copious
and
standard
much
is
published
but
little
printed
the
rays
which
stream
through
the
shutter
will
be
no
longer
remembered
when
the
shutter
is
wholly
removed
no
method
nor
discipline
can
supersede
the
necessity
of
being
forever
on
the
alert
what
is
a
course
of
history
or
philosophy
or
poetry
no
matter
how
well
selected
or
the
best
society
or
the
most
admirable
routine
of
life
compared
with
the
discipline
of
looking
always
at
what
is
to
be
seen
will
you
be
a
reader
a
student
merely
or
a
seer
read
your
fate
see
what
is
before
you
and
walk
on
into
futurity
i
did
not
read
books
the
first
summer
i
hoed
beans
nay
i
often
did
better
than
this
there
were
times
when
i
could
not
afford
to
sacrifice
the
bloom
of
the
present
moment
to
any
work
whether
of
the
head
or
hands
i
love
a
broad
margin
to
my
life
sometimes
in
a
summer
morning
having
taken
my
accustomed
bath
i
sat
in
my
sunny
doorway
from
sunrise
till
noon
rapt
in
a
revery
amidst
the
pines
and
hickories
and
sumachs
in
undisturbed
solitude
and
stillness
while
the
birds
sing
around
or
flitted
noiseless
through
the
house
until
by
the
sun
falling
in
at
my
west
window
or
the
noise
of
some
traveller
s
wagon
on
the
distant
highway
i
was
reminded
of
the
lapse
of
time
i
grew
in
those
seasons
like
corn
in
the
night
and
they
were
far
better
than
any
work
of
the
hands
would
have
been
they
were
not
time
subtracted
from
my
life
but
so
much
over
and
above
my
usual
allowance
i
realized
what
the
orientals
mean
by
contemplation
and
the
forsaking
of
works
for
the
most
part
i
minded
not
how
the
hours
went
the
day
advanced
as
if
to
light
some
work
of
mine
it
was
morning
and
lo
now
it
is
evening
and
nothing
memorable
is
accomplished
instead
of
singing
like
the
birds
i
silently
smiled
at
my
incessant
good
fortune
as
the
sparrow
had
its
trill
sitting
on
the
hickory
before
my
door
so
had
i
my
chuckle
or
suppressed
warble
which
he
might
hear
out
of
my
nest
my
days
were
not
days
of
the
week
bearing
the
stamp
of
any
heathen
deity
nor
were
they
minced
into
hours
and
fretted
by
the
ticking
of
a
clock
for
i
lived
like
the
puri
indians
of
whom
it
is
said
that
for
yesterday
today
and
tomorrow
they
have
only
one
word
and
they
express
the
variety
of
meaning
by
pointing
backward
for
yesterday
forward
for
tomorrow
and
overhead
for
the
passing
day
this
was
sheer
idleness
to
my
fellow
townsmen
no
doubt
but
if
the
birds
and
flowers
had
tried
me
by
their
standard
i
should
not
have
been
found
wanting
a
man
must
find
his
occasions
in
himself
it
is
true
the
natural
day
is
very
calm
and
will
hardly
reprove
his
indolence
i
had
this
advantage
at
least
in
my
mode
of
life
over
those
who
were
obliged
to
look
abroad
for
amusement
to
society
and
the
theatre
that
my
life
itself
was
become
my
amusement
and
never
ceased
to
be
novel
it
was
a
drama
of
many
scenes
and
without
an
end
if
we
were
always
indeed
getting
our
living
and
regulating
our
lives
according
to
the
last
and
best
mode
we
had
learned
we
should
never
be
troubled
with
ennui
follow
your
genius
closely
enough
and
it
will
not
fail
to
show
you
a
fresh
prospect
every
hour
housework
was
a
pleasant
pastime
when
my
floor
was
dirty
i
rose
early
and
setting
all
my
furniture
out
of
doors
on
the
grass
bed
and
bedstead
making
but
one
budget
dashed
water
on
the
floor
and
sprinkled
white
sand
from
the
pond
on
it
and
then
with
a
broom
scrubbed
it
clean
and
white
and
by
the
time
the
villagers
had
broken
their
fast
the
morning
sun
had
dried
my
house
sufficiently
to
allow
me
to
move
in
again
and
my
meditations
were
almost
uninterupted
it
was
pleasant
to
see
my
whole
household
effects
out
on
the
grass
making
a
little
pile
like
a
gypsy
s
pack
and
my
three
legged
table
from
which
i
did
not
remove
the
books
and
pen
and
ink
standing
amid
the
pines
and
hickories
they
seemed
glad
to
get
out
themselves
and
as
if
unwilling
to
be
brought
in
i
was
sometimes
tempted
to
stretch
an
awning
over
them
and
take
my
seat
there
it
was
worth
the
while
to
see
the
sun
shine
on
these
things
and
hear
the
free
wind
blow
on
them
so
much
more
interesting
most
familiar
objects
look
out
of
doors
than
in
the
house
a
bird
sits
on
the
next
bough
life
everlasting
grows
under
the
table
and
blackberry
vines
run
round
its
legs
pine
cones
chestnut
burs
and
strawberry
leaves
are
strewn
about
it
looked
as
if
this
was
the
way
these
forms
came
to
be
transferred
to
our
furniture
to
tables
chairs
and
bedsteads
because
they
once
stood
in
their
midst
my
house
was
on
the
side
of
a
hill
immediately
on
the
edge
of
the
larger
wood
in
the
midst
of
a
young
forest
of
pitch
pines
and
hickories
and
half
a
dozen
rods
from
the
pond
to
which
a
narrow
footpath
led
down
the
hill
in
my
front
yard
grew
the
strawberry
blackberry
and
life
everlasting
johnswort
and
goldenrod
shrub
oaks
and
sand
cherry
blueberry
and
groundnut
near
the
end
of
may
the
sand
cherry
cerasus
pumila
adorned
the
sides
of
the
path
with
its
delicate
flowers
arranged
in
umbels
cylindrically
about
its
short
stems
which
last
in
the
fall
weighed
down
with
good
sized
and
handsome
cherries
fell
over
in
wreaths
like
rays
on
every
side
i
tasted
them
out
of
compliment
to
nature
though
they
were
scarcely
palatable
the
sumach
rhus
glabra
grew
luxuriantly
about
the
house
pushing
up
through
the
embankment
which
i
had
made
and
growing
five
or
six
feet
the
first
season
its
broad
pinnate
tropical
leaf
was
pleasant
though
strange
to
look
on
the
large
buds
suddenly
pushing
out
late
in
the
spring
from
dry
sticks
which
had
seemed
to
be
dead
developed
themselves
as
by
magic
into
graceful
green
and
tender
boughs
an
inch
in
diameter
and
sometimes
as
i
sat
at
my
window
so
heedlessly
did
they
grow
and
tax
their
weak
joints
i
heard
a
fresh
and
tender
bough
suddenly
fall
like
a
fan
to
the
ground
when
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
stirring
broken
off
by
its
own
weight
in
august
the
large
masses
of
berries
which
when
in
flower
had
attracted
many
wild
bees
gradually
assumed
their
bright
velvety
crimson
hue
and
by
their
weight
again
bent
down
and
broke
the
tender
limbs
*

*
*
as
i
sit
at
my
window
this
summer
afternoon
hawks
are
circling
about
my
clearing
the
tantivy
of
wild
pigeons
flying
by
two
and
threes
athwart
my
view
or
perching
restless
on
the
white
pine
boughs
behind
my
house
gives
a
voice
to
the
air
a
fish
hawk
dimples
the
glassy
surface
of
the
pond
and
brings
up
a
fish
a
mink
steals
out
of
the
marsh
before
my
door
and
seizes
a
frog
by
the
shore
the
sedge
is
bending
under
the
weight
of
the
reed
birds
flitting
hither
and
thither
and
for
the
last
half
hour
i
have
heard
the
rattle
of
railroad
cars
now
dying
away
and
then
reviving
like
the
beat
of
a
partridge
conveying
travellers
from
boston
to
the
country
for
i
did
not
live
so
out
of
the
world
as
that
boy
who
as
i
hear
was
put
out
to
a
farmer
in
the
east
part
of
the
town
but
ere
long
ran
away
and
came
home
again
quite
down
at
the
heel
and
homesick
he
had
never
seen
such
a
dull
and
out
of
the
way
place
the
folks
were
all
gone
off
why
you
couldn
t
even
hear
the
whistle
i
doubt
if
there
is
such
a
place
in
massachusetts
now
in
truth
our
village
has
become
a
butt
for
one
of
those
fleet
railroad
shafts
and
o
er
our
peaceful
plain
its
soothing
sound
is
concord
the
fitchburg
railroad
touches
the
pond
about
a
hundred
rods
south
of
where
i
dwell
i
usually
go
to
the
village
along
its
causeway
and
am
as
it
were
related
to
society
by
this
link
the
men
on
the
freight
trains
who
go
over
the
whole
length
of
the
road
bow
to
me
as
to
an
old
acquaintance
they
pass
me
so
often
and
apparently
they
take
me
for
an
employee
and
so
i
am
i
too
would
fain
be
a
track
repairer
somewhere
in
the
orbit
of
the
earth
the
whistle
of
the
locomotive
penetrates
my
woods
summer
and
winter
sounding
like
the
scream
of
a
hawk
sailing
over
some
farmer
s
yard
informing
me
that
many
restless
city
merchants
are
arriving
within
the
circle
of
the
town
or
adventurous
country
traders
from
the
other
side
as
they
come
under
one
horizon
they
shout
their
warning
to
get
off
the
track
to
the
other
heard
sometimes
through
the
circles
of
two
towns
here
come
your
groceries
country
your
rations
countrymen
nor
is
there
any
man
so
independent
on
his
farm
that
he
can
say
them
nay
and
here
s
your
pay
for
them
screams
the
countryman
s
whistle
timber
like
long
battering
rams
going
twenty
miles
an
hour
against
the
city
s
walls
and
chairs
enough
to
seat
all
the
weary
and
heavy
laden
that
dwell
within
them
with
such
huge
and
lumbering
civility
the
country
hands
a
chair
to
the
city
all
the
indian
huckleberry
hills
are
stripped
all
the
cranberry
meadows
are
raked
into
the
city
up
comes
the
cotton
down
goes
the
woven
cloth
up
comes
the
silk
down
goes
the
woollen
up
come
the
books
but
down
goes
the
wit
that
writes
them
when
i
meet
the
engine
with
its
train
of
cars
moving
off
with
planetary
motion
or
rather
like
a
comet
for
the
beholder
knows
not
if
with
that
velocity
and
with
that
direction
it
will
ever
revisit
this
system
since
its
orbit
does
not
look
like
a
returning
curve
with
its
steam
cloud
like
a
banner
streaming
behind
in
golden
and
silver
wreaths
like
many
a
downy
cloud
which
i
have
seen
high
in
the
heavens
unfolding
its
masses
to
the
light
as
if
this
traveling
demigod
this
cloud
compeller
would
ere
long
take
the
sunset
sky
for
the
livery
of
his
train
when
i
hear
the
iron
horse
make
the
hills
echo
with
his
snort
like
thunder
shaking
the
earth
with
his
feet
and
breathing
fire
and
smoke
from
his
nostrils
what
kind
of
winged
horse
or
fiery
dragon
they
will
put
into
the
new
mythology
i
don
t
know
it
seems
as
if
the
earth
had
got
a
race
now
worthy
to
inhabit
it
if
all
were
as
it
seems
and
men
made
the
elements
their
servants
for
noble
ends
if
the
cloud
that
hangs
over
the
engine
were
the
perspiration
of
heroic
deeds
or
as
beneficent
as
that
which
floats
over
the
farmer
s
fields
then
the
elements
and
nature
herself
would
cheerfully
accompany
men
on
their
errands
and
be
their
escort
i
watch
the
passage
of
the
morning
cars
with
the
same
feeling
that
i
do
the
rising
of
the
sun
which
is
hardly
more
regular
their
train
of
clouds
stretching
far
behind
and
rising
higher
and
higher
going
to
heaven
while
the
cars
are
going
to
boston
conceals
the
sun
for
a
minute
and
casts
my
distant
field
into
the
shade
a
celestial
train
beside
which
the
petty
train
of
cars
which
hugs
the
earth
is
but
the
barb
of
the
spear
the
stabler
of
the
iron
horse
was
up
early
this
winter
morning
by
the
light
of
the
stars
amid
the
mountains
to
fodder
and
harness
his
steed
fire
too
was
awakened
thus
early
to
put
the
vital
heat
in
him
and
get
him
off
if
the
enterprise
were
as
innocent
as
it
is
early
if
the
snow
lies
deep
they
strap
on
his
snowshoes
and
with
the
giant
plow
plow
a
furrow
from
the
mountains
to
the
seaboard
in
which
the
cars
like
a
following
drill
barrow
sprinkle
all
the
restless
men
and
floating
merchandise
in
the
country
for
seed
all
day
the
fire
steed
flies
over
the
country
stopping
only
that
his
master
may
rest
and
i
am
awakened
by
his
tramp
and
defiant
snort
at
midnight
when
in
some
remote
glen
in
the
woods
he
fronts
the
elements
incased
in
ice
and
snow
and
he
will
reach
his
stall
only
with
the
morning
star
to
start
once
more
on
his
travels
without
rest
or
slumber
or
perchance
at
evening
i
hear
him
in
his
stable
blowing
off
the
superfluous
energy
of
the
day
that
he
may
calm
his
nerves
and
cool
his
liver
and
brain
for
a
few
hours
of
iron
slumber
if
the
enterprise
were
as
heroic
and
commanding
as
it
is
protracted
and
unwearied
far
through
unfrequented
woods
on
the
confines
of
towns
where
once
only
the
hunter
penetrated
by
day
in
the
darkest
night
dart
these
bright
saloons
without
the
knowledge
of
their
inhabitants
this
moment
stopping
at
some
brilliant
station
house
in
town
or
city
where
a
social
crowd
is
gathered
the
next
in
the
dismal
swamp
scaring
the
owl
and
fox
the
startings
and
arrivals
of
the
cars
are
now
the
epochs
in
the
village
day
they
go
and
come
with
such
regularity
and
precision
and
their
whistle
can
be
heard
so
far
that
the
farmers
set
their
clocks
by
them
and
thus
one
well
conducted
institution
regulates
a
whole
country
have
not
men
improved
somewhat
in
punctuality
since
the
railroad
was
invented
do
they
not
talk
and
think
faster
in
the
depot
than
they
did
in
the
stage
office
there
is
something
electrifying
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
former
place
i
have
been
astonished
at
the
miracles
it
has
wrought
that
some
of
my
neighbors
who
i
should
have
prophesied
once
for
all
would
never
get
to
boston
by
so
prompt
a
conveyance
are
on
hand
when
the
bell
rings
to
do
things
railroad
fashion
is
now
the
byword
and
it
is
worth
the
while
to
be
warned
so
often
and
so
sincerely
by
any
power
to
get
off
its
track
there
is
no
stopping
to
read
the
riot
act
no
firing
over
the
heads
of
the
mob
in
this
case
we
have
constructed
a
fate
an
atropos
that
never
turns
aside
let
that
be
the
name
of
your
engine
men
are
advertised
that
at
a
certain
hour
and
minute
these
bolts
will
be
shot
toward
particular
points
of
the
compass
yet
it
interferes
with
no
man
s
business
and
the
children
go
to
school
on
the
other
track
we
live
the
steadier
for
it
we
are
all
educated
thus
to
be
sons
of
tell
the
air
is
full
of
invisible
bolts
every
path
but
your
own
is
the
path
of
fate
keep
on
your
own
track
then
what
recommends
commerce
to
me
is
its
enterprise
and
bravery
it
does
not
clasp
its
hands
and
pray
to
jupiter
i
see
these
men
every
day
go
about
their
business
with
more
or
less
courage
and
content
doing
more
even
than
they
suspect
and
perchance
better
employed
than
they
could
have
consciously
devised
i
am
less
affected
by
their
heroism
who
stood
up
for
half
an
hour
in
the
front
line
at
buena
vista
than
by
the
steady
and
cheerful
valor
of
the
men
who
inhabit
the
snowplow
for
their
winter
quarters
who
have
not
merely
the
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
courage
which
bonaparte
thought
was
the
rarest
but
whose
courage
does
not
go
to
rest
so
early
who
go
to
sleep
only
when
the
storm
sleeps
or
the
sinews
of
their
iron
steed
are
frozen
on
this
morning
of
the
great
snow
perchance
which
is
still
raging
and
chilling
men
s
blood
i
bear
the
muffled
tone
of
their
engine
bell
from
out
the
fog
bank
of
their
chilled
breath
which
announces
that
the
cars
are
coming
without
long
delay
notwithstanding
the
veto
of
a
new
england
northeast
snow
storm
and
i
behold
the
plowmen
covered
with
snow
and
rime
their
heads
peering
above
the
mould
board
which
is
turning
down
other
than
daisies
and
the
nests
of
field
mice
like
bowlders
of
the
sierra
nevada
that
occupy
an
outside
place
in
the
universe
commerce
is
unexpectedly
confident
and
serene
alert
adventurous
and
unwearied
it
is
very
natural
in
its
methods
withal
far
more
so
than
many
fantastic
enterprises
and
sentimental
experiments
and
hence
its
singular
success
i
am
refreshed
and
expanded
when
the
freight
train
rattles
past
me
and
i
smell
the
stores
which
go
dispensing
their
odors
all
the
way
from
long
wharf
to
lake
champlain
reminding
me
of
foreign
parts
of
coral
reefs
and
indian
oceans
and
tropical
climes
and
the
extent
of
the
globe
i
feel
more
like
a
citizen
of
the
world
at
the
sight
of
the
palm
leaf
which
will
cover
so
many
flaxen
new
england
heads
the
next
summer
the
manilla
hemp
and
cocoanut
husks
the
old
junk
gunny
bags
scrap
iron
and
rusty
nails
this
carload
of
torn
sails
is
more
legible
and
interesting
now
than
if
they
should
be
wrought
into
paper
and
printed
books
who
can
write
so
graphically
the
history
of
the
storms
they
have
weathered
as
these
rents
have
done
they
are
proof
sheets
which
need
no
correction

both
of

on

of
salt

the
strong
new

scent
reminding
me
of
the
grand

and
the
fisheries
who
has
not
seen
a
salt
fish
thoroughly
cured
for
this
world
so
that
nothing
can
spoil
it
and
putting
the
perseverance
of
the
saints
to
the
blush
with
which
you
may
sweep
or
pave
the
streets
and
split
your
kindlings
and
the
teamster
shelter
himself
and
his
lading
against
sun
wind
and
rain
behind
it
and
the
trader
as
a
concord
trader
once
did
hang
it
up
by
his
door
for
a
sign
when
he
commences
business
until
at
last
his
oldest
customer
cannot
tell
surely
whether
it
be
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
and
yet
it
shall
be
as
pure
as
a
snowflake
and
if
it
be
put
into
a
pot
and
boiled
will
come
out
an
excellent
dun
fish
for
a
saturday
s
dinner
next
spanish
hides
with
the
tails
still
preserving
their
twist
and
the
angle
of
elevation
they
had
when
the
oxen
that
wore
them
were
careering
over
the
pampas
of
the
spanish
main
a
type
of
all
obstinacy
and
evincing
how
almost
hopeless
and
incurable
are
all
constitutional
vices
i
confess
that
practically
speaking
when
i
have
learned
a
man
s
real
disposition
i
have
no
hopes
of
changing
it
for
the
better
or
worse
in
this
state
of
existence
as
the
orientals
say
a
cur
s
tail
may
be
warmed
and
pressed
and
bound
round
with
ligatures
and
after
a
twelve
years
labor
bestowed
upon
it
still
it
will
retain
its
natural
form
the
only
effectual
cure
for
such
inveteracies
as
these
tails
exhibit
is
to
make
glue
of
them
which
i
believe
is
what
is
usually
done
with
them
and
then
they
will
stay
put
and
stick
here
is
a
hogshead
of
molasses
or
of
brandy
directed
to
john
smith
cuttingsville
vermont
some
trader
among
the
green
mountains
who
imports
for
the
farmers
near
his
clearing
and
now
perchance
stands
over
his
bulkhead
and
thinks
of
the
last
arrivals
on
the
coast
how
they
may
affect
the
price
for
him
telling
his
customers
this
moment
as
he
has
told
them
twenty
times
before
this
morning
that
he
expects
some
by
the
next
train
of
prime
quality
it
is
advertised
in
the
cuttingsville
times
while
these
things
go
up
other
things
come
down
warned
by
the
whizzing
sound
i
look
up
from
my
book
and
see
some
tall
pine
hewn
on
far
northern
hills
which
has
winged
its
way
over
the
green
mountains
and
the
connecticut
shot
like
an
arrow
through
the
township
within
ten
minutes
and
scarce
another
eye
beholds
it
going
to
be
the
mast
of
some
great
ammiral
and
hark
here
comes
the
cattle
train
bearing
the
cattle
of
a
thousand
hills
sheepcots
stables
and
cow
yards
in
the
air
drovers
with
their
sticks
and
shepherd
boys
in
the
midst
of
their
flocks
all
but
the
mountain
pastures
whirled
along
like
leaves
blown
from
the
mountains
by
the
september
gales
the
air
is
filled
with
the
bleating
of
calves
and
sheep
and
the
hustling
of
oxen
as
if
a
pastoral
valley
were
going
by
when
the
old
bell
wether
at
the
head
rattles
his
bell
the
mountains
do
indeed
skip
like
rams
and
the
little
hills
like
lambs
a
carload
of
drovers
too
in
the
midst
on
a
level
with
their
droves
now
their
vocation
gone
but
still
clinging
to
their
useless
sticks
as
their
badge
of
office
but
their
dogs
where
are
they
it
is
a
stampede
to
them
they
are
quite
thrown
out
they
have
lost
the
scent
methinks
i
hear
them
barking
behind
the
peterboro
hills
or
panting
up
the
western
slope
of
the
green
mountains
they
will
not
be
in
at
the
death
their
vocation
too
is
gone
their
fidelity
and
sagacity
are
below
par
now
they
will
slink
back
to
their
kennels
in
disgrace
or
perchance
run
wild
and
strike
a
league
with
the
wolf
and
the
fox
so
is
your
pastoral
life
whirled
past
and
away
but
the
bell
rings
and
i
must
get
off
the
track
and
let
the
cars
go
by
