fyodor
pavlovitch
karamazov
alexey
fyodorovitch
karamazov
was
the
third
son
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
karamazov
a
land
owner
well
known
in
our
district
in
his
own
day
and
still
remembered
among
us
owing
to
his
gloomy
and
tragic
death
which
happened
thirteen
years
ago
and
which
i
shall
describe
in
its
proper
place
for
the
present
i
will
only
say
that
this
landowner
for
so
we
used
to
call
him
although
he
hardly
spent
a
day
of
his
life
on
his
own
estate
was
a
strange
type
yet
one
pretty
frequently
to
be
met
with
a
type
abject
and
vicious
and
at
the
same
time
senseless
but
he
was
one
of
those
senseless
persons
who
are
very
well
capable
of
looking
after
their
worldly
affairs
and
apparently
after
nothing
else
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
instance
began
with
next
to
nothing
his
estate
was
of
the
smallest
he
ran
to
dine
at
other
men
s
tables
and
fastened
on
them
as
a
toady
yet
at
his
death
it
appeared
that
he
had
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
in
hard
cash
at
the
same
time
he
was
all
his
life
one
of
the
most
senseless
fantastical
fellows
in
the
whole
district
i
repeat
it
was
not
stupidity
the
majority
of
these
fantastical
fellows
are
shrewd
and
intelligent
enough
but
just
senselessness
and
a
peculiar
national
form
of
it
he
was
married
twice
and
had
three
sons
the
eldest
dmitri
by
his
first
wife
and
two
ivan
and
alexey
by
his
second
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
first
wife
adela
da
ivanovna
belonged
to
a
fairly
rich
and
distinguished
noble
family
also
landowners
in
our
district
the
mi
sovs
how
it
came
to
pass
that
an
heiress
who
was
also
a
beauty
and
moreover
one
of
those
vigorous
intelligent
girls
so
common
in
this
generation
but
sometimes
also
to
be
found
in
the
last
could
have
married
such
a
worthless
puny
weakling
as
we
all
called
him
i
won
t
attempt
to
explain
i
knew
a
young
lady
of
the
last
romantic
generation
who
after
some
years
of
an
enigmatic
passion
for
a
gentleman
whom
she
might
quite
easily
have
married
at
any
moment
invented
insuperable
obstacles
to
their
union
and
ended
by
throwing
herself
one
stormy
night
into
a
rather
deep
and
rapid
river
from
a
high
bank
almost
a
precipice
and
so
perished
entirely
to
satisfy
her
own
caprice
and
to
be
like
shakespeare
s
ophelia
indeed
if
this
precipice
a
chosen
and
favorite
spot
of
hers
had
been
less
picturesque
if
there
had
been
a
prosaic
flat
bank
in
its
place
most
likely
the
suicide
would
never
have
taken
place
this
is
a
fact
and
probably
there
have
been
not
a
few
similar
instances
in
the
last
two
or
three
generations
adela
da
ivanovna
mi
sov
s
action
was
similarly
no
doubt
an
echo
of
other
people
s
ideas
and
was
due
to
the
irritation
caused
by
lack
of
mental
freedom
she
wanted
perhaps
to
show
her
feminine
independence
to
override
class
distinctions
and
the
despotism
of
her
family
and
a
pliable
imagination
persuaded
her
we
must
suppose
for
a
brief
moment
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
spite
of
his
parasitic
position
was
one
of
the
bold
and
ironical
spirits
of
that
progressive
epoch
though
he
was
in
fact
an
ill
natured
buffoon
and
nothing
more
what
gave
the
marriage
piquancy
was
that
it
was
preceded
by
an
elopement
and
this
greatly
captivated
adela
da
ivanovna
s
fancy
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
position
at
the
time
made
him
specially
eager
for
any
such
enterprise
for
he
was
passionately
anxious
to
make
a
career
in
one
way
or
another
to
attach
himself
to
a
good
family
and
obtain
a
dowry
was
an
alluring
prospect
as
for
mutual
love
it
did
not
exist
apparently
either
in
the
bride
or
in
him
in
spite
of
adela
da
ivanovna
s
beauty
this
was
perhaps
a
unique
case
of
the
kind
in
the
life
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
was
always
of
a
voluptuous
temper
and
ready
to
run
after
any
petticoat
on
the
slightest
encouragement
she
seems
to
have
been
the
only
woman
who
made
no
particular
appeal
to
his
senses
immediately
after
the
elopement
adela
da
ivanovna
discerned
in
a
flash
that
she
had
no
feeling
for
her
husband
but
contempt
the
marriage
accordingly
showed
itself
in
its
true
colors
with
extraordinary
rapidity
although
the
family
accepted
the
event
pretty
quickly
and
apportioned
the
runaway
bride
her
dowry
the
husband
and
wife
began
to
lead
a
most
disorderly
life
and
there
were
everlasting
scenes
between
them
it
was
said
that
the
young
wife
showed
incomparably
more
generosity
and
dignity
than
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
as
is
now
known
got
hold
of
all
her
money
up
to
twenty
five
thousand
roubles
as
soon
as
she
received
it
so
that
those
thousands
were
lost
to
her
for
ever
the
little
village
and
the
rather
fine
town
house
which
formed
part
of
her
dowry
he
did
his
utmost
for
a
long
time
to
transfer
to
his
name
by
means
of
some
deed
of
conveyance
he
would
probably
have
succeeded
merely
from
her
moral
fatigue
and
desire
to
get
rid
of
him
and
from
the
contempt
and
loathing
he
aroused
by
his
persistent
and
shameless
importunity
but
fortunately
adela
da
ivanovna
s
family
intervened
and
circumvented
his
greediness
it
is
known
for
a
fact
that
frequent
fights
took
place
between
the
husband
and
wife
but
rumor
had
it
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
beat
his
wife
but
was
beaten
by
her
for
she
was
a
hot
tempered
bold
dark
browed
impatient
woman
possessed
of
remarkable
physical
strength
finally
she
left
the
house
and
ran
away
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
with
a
destitute
divinity
student
leaving
mitya
a
child
of
three
years
old
in
her
husband
s
hands
immediately
fyodor
pavlovitch
introduced
a
regular
harem
into
the
house
and
abandoned
himself
to
orgies
of
drunkenness
in
the
intervals
he
used
to
drive
all
over
the
province
complaining
tearfully
to
each
and
all
of
adela
da
ivanovna
s
having
left
him
going
into
details
too
disgraceful
for
a
husband
to
mention
in
regard
to
his
own
married
life
what
seemed
to
gratify
him
and
flatter
his
self
love
most
was
to
play
the
ridiculous
part
of
the
injured
husband
and
to
parade
his
woes
with
embellishments
one
would
think
that
you
d
got
a
promotion
fyodor
pavlovitch
you
seem
so
pleased
in
spite
of
your
sorrow
scoffers
said
to
him
many
even
added
that
he
was
glad
of
a
new
comic
part
in
which
to
play
the
buffoon
and
that
it
was
simply
to
make
it
funnier
that
he
pretended
to
be
unaware
of
his
ludicrous
position
but
who
knows
it
may
have
been
simplicity
at
last
he
succeeded
in
getting
on
the
track
of
his
runaway
wife
the
poor
woman
turned
out
to
be
in
petersburg
where
she
had
gone
with
her
divinity
student
and
where
she
had
thrown
herself
into
a
life
of
complete
emancipation
fyodor
pavlovitch
at
once
began
bustling
about
making
preparations
to
go
to
petersburg
with
what
object
he
could
not
himself
have
said
he
would
perhaps
have
really
gone
but
having
determined
to
do
so
he
felt
at
once
entitled
to
fortify
himself
for
the
journey
by
another
bout
of
reckless
drinking
and
just
at
that
time
his
wife
s
family
received
the
news
of
her
death
in
petersburg
she
had
died
quite
suddenly
in
a
garret
according
to
one
story
of
typhus
or
as
another
version
had
it
of
starvation
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
drunk
when
he
heard
of
his
wife
s
death
and
the
story
is
that
he
ran
out
into
the
street
and
began
shouting
with
joy
raising
his
hands
to
heaven
lord
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
but
others
say
he
wept
without
restraint
like
a
little
child
so
much
so
that
people
were
sorry
for
him
in
spite
of
the
repulsion
he
inspired
it
is
quite
possible
that
both
versions
were
true
that
he
rejoiced
at
his
release
and
at
the
same
time
wept
for
her
who
released
him
as
a
general
rule
people
even
the
wicked
are
much
more
na
ve
and
simple
hearted
than
we
suppose
and
we
ourselves
are
too
chapter
ii
he
gets
rid
of
his
eldest
son
you
can
easily
imagine
what
a
father
such
a
man
could
be
and
how
he
would
bring
up
his
children
his
behavior
as
a
father
was
exactly
what
might
be
expected
he
completely
abandoned
the
child
of
his
marriage
with
adela
da
ivanovna
not
from
malice
nor
because
of
his
matrimonial
grievances
but
simply
because
he
forgot
him
while
he
was
wearying
every
one
with
his
tears
and
complaints
and
turning
his
house
into
a
sink
of
debauchery
a
faithful
servant
of
the
family
grigory
took
the
three
year
old
mitya
into
his
care
if
he
hadn
t
looked
after
him
there
would
have
been
no
one
even
to
change
the
baby
s
little
shirt
it
happened
moreover
that
the
child
s
relations
on
his
mother
s
side
forgot
him
too
at
first
his
grandfather
was
no
longer
living
his
widow
mitya
s
grandmother
had
moved
to
moscow
and
was
seriously
ill
while
his
daughters
were
married
so
that
mitya
remained
for
almost
a
whole
year
in
old
grigory
s
charge
and
lived
with
him
in
the
servant
s
cottage
but
if
his
father
had
remembered
him
he
could
not
indeed
have
been
altogether
unaware
of
his
existence
he
would
have
sent
him
back
to
the
cottage
as
the
child
would
only
have
been
in
the
way
of
his
debaucheries
but
a
cousin
of
mitya
s
mother
pyotr
alexandrovitch
mi
sov
happened
to
return
from
paris
he
lived
for
many
years
afterwards
abroad
but
was
at
that
time
quite
a
young
man
and
distinguished
among
the
mi
sovs
as
a
man
of
enlightened
ideas
and
of
european
culture
who
had
been
in
the
capitals
and
abroad
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
became
a
liberal
of
the
type
common
in
the
forties
and
fifties
in
the
course
of
his
career
he
had
come
into
contact
with
many
of
the
most
liberal
men
of
his
epoch
both
in
russia
and
abroad
he
had
known
proudhon
and
bakunin
personally
and
in
his
declining
years
was
very
fond
of
describing
the
three
days
of
the
paris
revolution
of
february
1848
hinting
that
he
himself
had
almost
taken
part
in
the
fighting
on
the
barricades
this
was
one
of
the
most
grateful
recollections
of
his
youth
he
had
an
independent
property
of
about
a
thousand
souls
to
reckon
in
the
old
style
his
splendid
estate
lay
on
the
outskirts
of
our
little
town
and
bordered
on
the
lands
of
our
famous
monastery
with
which
pyotr
alexandrovitch
began
an
endless
lawsuit
almost
as
soon
as
he
came
into
the
estate
concerning
the
rights
of
fishing
in
the
river
or
wood
cutting
in
the
forest
i
don
t
know
exactly
which
he
regarded
it
as
his
duty
as
a
citizen
and
a
man
of
culture
to
open
an
attack
upon
the
clericals
hearing
all
about
adela
da
ivanovna
whom
he
of
course
remembered
and
in
whom
he
had
at
one
time
been
interested
and
learning
of
the
existence
of
mitya
he
intervened
in
spite
of
all
his
youthful
indignation
and
contempt
for
fyodor
pavlovitch
he
made
the
latter
s
acquaintance
for
the
first
time
and
told
him
directly
that
he
wished
to
undertake
the
child
s
education
he
used
long
afterwards
to
tell
as
a
characteristic
touch
that
when
he
began
to
speak
of
mitya
fyodor
pavlovitch
looked
for
some
time
as
though
he
did
not
understand
what
child
he
was
talking
about
and
even
as
though
he
was
surprised
to
hear
that
he
had
a
little
son
in
the
house
the
story
may
have
been
exaggerated
yet
it
must
have
been
something
like
the
truth
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
all
his
life
fond
of
acting
of
suddenly
playing
an
unexpected
part
sometimes
without
any
motive
for
doing
so
and
even
to
his
own
direct
disadvantage
as
for
instance
in
the
present
case
this
habit
however
is
characteristic
of
a
very
great
number
of
people
some
of
them
very
clever
ones
not
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
pyotr
alexandrovitch
carried
the
business
through
vigorously
and
was
appointed
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
joint
guardian
of
the
child
who
had
a
small
property
a
house
and
land
left
him
by
his
mother
mitya
did
in
fact
pass
into
this
cousin
s
keeping
but
as
the
latter
had
no
family
of
his
own
and
after
securing
the
revenues
of
his
estates
was
in
haste
to
return
at
once
to
paris
he
left
the
boy
in
charge
of
one
of
his
cousins
a
lady
living
in
moscow
it
came
to
pass
that
settling
permanently
in
paris
he
too
forgot
the
child
especially
when
the
revolution
of
february
broke
out
making
an
impression
on
his
mind
that
he
remembered
all
the
rest
of
his
life
the
moscow
lady
died
and
mitya
passed
into
the
care
of
one
of
her
married
daughters
i
believe
he
changed
his
home
a
fourth
time
later
on
i
won
t
enlarge
upon
that
now
as
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
later
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
firstborn
and
must
confine
myself
now
to
the
most
essential
facts
about
him
without
which
i
could
not
begin
my
story
in
the
first
place
this
mitya
or
rather
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
the
only
one
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
three
sons
who
grew
up
in
the
belief
that
he
had
property
and
that
he
would
be
independent
on
coming
of
age
he
spent
an
irregular
boyhood
and
youth
he
did
not
finish
his
studies
at
the
gymnasium
he
got
into
a
military
school
then
went
to
the
caucasus
was
promoted
fought
a
duel
and
was
degraded
to
the
ranks
earned
promotion
again
led
a
wild
life
and
spent
a
good
deal
of
money
he
did
not
begin
to
receive
any
income
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
until
he
came
of
age
and
until
then
got
into
debt
he
saw
and
knew
his
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
the
first
time
on
coming
of
age
when
he
visited
our
neighborhood
on
purpose
to
settle
with
him
about
his
property
he
seems
not
to
have
liked
his
father
he
did
not
stay
long
with
him
and
made
haste
to
get
away
having
only
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
sum
of
money
and
entering
into
an
agreement
for
future
payments
from
the
estate
of
the
revenues
and
value
of
which
he
was
unable
a
fact
worthy
of
note
upon
this
occasion
to
get
a
statement
from
his
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
remarked
for
the
first
time
then
this
too
should
be
noted
that
mitya
had
a
vague
and
exaggerated
idea
of
his
property
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
very
well
satisfied
with
this
as
it
fell
in
with
his
own
designs
he
gathered
only
that
the
young
man
was
frivolous
unruly
of
violent
passions
impatient
and
dissipated
and
that
if
he
could
only
obtain
ready
money
he
would
be
satisfied
although
only
of
course
for
a
short
time
so
fyodor
pavlovitch
began
to
take
advantage
of
this
fact
sending
him
from
time
to
time
small
doles
installments
in
the
end
when
four
years
later
mitya
losing
patience
came
a
second
time
to
our
little
town
to
settle
up
once
for
all
with
his
father
it
turned
out
to
his
amazement
that
he
had
nothing
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
an
account
even
that
he
had
received
the
whole
value
of
his
property
in
sums
of
money
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
was
perhaps
even
in
debt
to
him
that
by
various
agreements
into
which
he
had
of
his
own
desire
entered
at
various
previous
dates
he
had
no
right
to
expect
anything
more
and
so
on
and
so
on
the
young
man
was
overwhelmed
suspected
deceit
and
cheating
and
was
almost
beside
himself
and
indeed
this
circumstance
led
to
the
catastrophe
the
account
of
which
forms
the
subject
of
my
first
introductory
story
or
rather
the
external
side
of
it
but
before
i
pass
to
that
story
i
must
say
a
little
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
other
two
sons
and
of
their
origin
chapter
iii
the
second
marriage
and
the
second
family
very
shortly
after
getting
his
four
year
old
mitya
off
his
hands
fyodor
pavlovitch
married
a
second
time
his
second
marriage
lasted
eight
years
he
took
this
second
wife
sofya
ivanovna
also
a
very
young
girl
from
another
province
where
he
had
gone
upon
some
small
piece
of
business
in
company
with
a
jew
though
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
a
drunkard
and
a
vicious
debauchee
he
never
neglected
investing
his
capital
and
managed
his
business
affairs
very
successfully
though
no
doubt
not
over
scrupulously
sofya
ivanovna
was
the
daughter
of
an
obscure
deacon
and
was
left
from
childhood
an
orphan
without
relations
she
grew
up
in
the
house
of
a
general
s
widow
a
wealthy
old
lady
of
good
position
who
was
at
once
her
benefactress
and
tormentor
i
do
not
know
the
details
but
i
have
only
heard
that
the
orphan
girl
a
meek
and
gentle
creature
was
once
cut
down
from
a
halter
in
which
she
was
hanging
from
a
nail
in
the
loft
so
terrible
were
her
sufferings
from
the
caprice
and
everlasting
nagging
of
this
old
woman
who
was
apparently
not
bad
hearted
but
had
become
an
insufferable
tyrant
through
idleness
fyodor
pavlovitch
made
her
an
offer
inquiries
were
made
about
him
and
he
was
refused
but
again
as
in
his
first
marriage
he
proposed
an
elopement
to
the
orphan
girl
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
she
would
not
on
any
account
have
married
him
if
she
had
known
a
little
more
about
him
in
time
but
she
lived
in
another
province
besides
what
could
a
little
girl
of
sixteen
know
about
it
except
that
she
would
be
better
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
than
remaining
with
her
benefactress
so
the
poor
child
exchanged
a
benefactress
for
a
benefactor
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
get
a
penny
this
time
for
the
general
s
widow
was
furious
she
gave
them
nothing
and
cursed
them
both
but
he
had
not
reckoned
on
a
dowry
what
allured
him
was
the
remarkable
beauty
of
the
innocent
girl
above
all
her
innocent
appearance
which
had
a
peculiar
attraction
for
a
vicious
profligate
who
had
hitherto
admired
only
the
coarser
types
of
feminine
beauty
those
innocent
eyes
slit
my
soul
up
like
a
razor
he
used
to
say
afterwards
with
his
loathsome
snigger
in
a
man
so
depraved
this
might
of
course
mean
no
more
than
sensual
attraction
as
he
had
received
no
dowry
with
his
wife
and
had
so
to
speak
taken
her
from
the
halter
he
did
not
stand
on
ceremony
with
her
making
her
feel
that
she
had
wronged
him
he
took
advantage
of
her
phenomenal
meekness
and
submissiveness
to
trample
on
the
elementary
decencies
of
marriage
he
gathered
loose
women
into
his
house
and
carried
on
orgies
of
debauchery
in
his
wife
s
presence
to
show
what
a
pass
things
had
come
to
i
may
mention
that
grigory
the
gloomy
stupid
obstinate
argumentative
servant
who
had
always
hated
his
first
mistress
adela
da
ivanovna
took
the
side
of
his
new
mistress
he
championed
her
cause
abusing
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
a
manner
little
befitting
a
servant
and
on
one
occasion
broke
up
the
revels
and
drove
all
the
disorderly
women
out
of
the
house
in
the
end
this
unhappy
young
woman
kept
in
terror
from
her
childhood
fell
into
that
kind
of
nervous
disease
which
is
most
frequently
found
in
peasant
women
who
are
said
to
be
possessed
by
devils
at
times
after
terrible
fits
of
hysterics
she
even
lost
her
reason
yet
she
bore
fyodor
pavlovitch
two
sons
ivan
and
alexey
the
eldest
in
the
first
year
of
marriage
and
the
second
three
years
later
when
she
died
little
alexey
was
in
his
fourth
year
and
strange
as
it
seems
i
know
that
he
remembered
his
mother
all
his
life
like
a
dream
of
course
at
her
death
almost
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
to
the
two
little
boys
as
to
their
elder
brother
mitya
they
were
completely
forgotten
and
abandoned
by
their
father
they
were
looked
after
by
the
same
grigory
and
lived
in
his
cottage
where
they
were
found
by
the
tyrannical
old
lady
who
had
brought
up
their
mother
she
was
still
alive
and
had
not
all
those
eight
years
forgotten
the
insult
done
her
all
that
time
she
was
obtaining
exact
information
as
to
her
sofya
s
manner
of
life
and
hearing
of
her
illness
and
hideous
surroundings
she
declared
aloud
two
or
three
times
to
her
retainers
it
serves
her
right
god
has
punished
her
for
her
ingratitude
exactly
three
months
after
sofya
ivanovna
s
death
the
general
s
widow
suddenly
appeared
in
our
town
and
went
straight
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
house
she
spent
only
half
an
hour
in
the
town
but
she
did
a
great
deal
it
was
evening
fyodor
pavlovitch
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
those
eight
years
came
in
to
her
drunk
the
story
is
that
instantly
upon
seeing
him
without
any
sort
of
explanation
she
gave
him
two
good
resounding
slaps
on
the
face
seized
him
by
a
tuft
of
hair
and
shook
him
three
times
up
and
down
then
without
a
word
she
went
straight
to
the
cottage
to
the
two
boys
seeing
at
the
first
glance
that
they
were
unwashed
and
in
dirty
linen
she
promptly
gave
grigory
too
a
box
on
the
ear
and
announcing
that
she
would
carry
off
both
the
children
she
wrapped
them
just
as
they
were
in
a
rug
put
them
in
the
carriage
and
drove
off
to
her
own
town
grigory
accepted
the
blow
like
a
devoted
slave
without
a
word
and
when
he
escorted
the
old
lady
to
her
carriage
he
made
her
a
low
bow
and
pronounced
impressively
that
god
would
repay
her
for
the
orphans
you
are
a
blockhead
all
the
same
the
old
lady
shouted
to
him
as
she
drove
away
fyodor
pavlovitch
thinking
it
over
decided
that
it
was
a
good
thing
and
did
not
refuse
the
general
s
widow
his
formal
consent
to
any
proposition
in
regard
to
his
children
s
education
as
for
the
slaps
she
had
given
him
he
drove
all
over
the
town
telling
the
story
it
happened
that
the
old
lady
died
soon
after
this
but
she
left
the
boys
in
her
will
a
thousand
roubles
each
for
their
instruction
and
so
that
all
be
spent
on
them
exclusively
with
the
condition
that
it
be
so
portioned
out
as
to
last
till
they
are
twenty
one
for
it
is
more
than
adequate
provision
for
such
children
if
other
people
think
fit
to
throw
away
their
money
let
them
i
have
not
read
the
will
myself
but
i
heard
there
was
something
queer
of
the
sort
very
whimsically
expressed
the
principal
heir
yefim
petrovitch
polenov
the
marshal
of
nobility
of
the
province
turned
out
however
to
be
an
honest
man
writing
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
discerning
at
once
that
he
could
extract
nothing
from
him
for
his
children
s
education
though
the
latter
never
directly
refused
but
only
procrastinated
as
he
always
did
in
such
cases
and
was
indeed
at
times
effusively
sentimental
yefim
petrovitch
took
a
personal
interest
in
the
orphans
he
became
especially
fond
of
the
younger
alexey
who
lived
for
a
long
while
as
one
of
his
family
i
beg
the
reader
to
note
this
from
the
beginning
and
to
yefim
petrovitch
a
man
of
a
generosity
and
humanity
rarely
to
be
met
with
the
young
people
were
more
indebted
for
their
education
and
bringing
up
than
to
any
one
he
kept
the
two
thousand
roubles
left
to
them
by
the
general
s
widow
intact
so
that
by
the
time
they
came
of
age
their
portions
had
been
doubled
by
the
accumulation
of
interest
he
educated
them
both
at
his
own
expense
and
certainly
spent
far
more
than
a
thousand
roubles
upon
each
of
them
i
won
t
enter
into
a
detailed
account
of
their
boyhood
and
youth
but
will
only
mention
a
few
of
the
most
important
events
of
the
elder
ivan
i
will
only
say
that
he
grew
into
a
somewhat
morose
and
reserved
though
far
from
timid
boy
at
ten
years
old
he
had
realized
that
they
were
living
not
in
their
own
home
but
on
other
people
s
charity
and
that
their
father
was
a
man
of
whom
it
was
disgraceful
to
speak
this
boy
began
very
early
almost
in
his
infancy
so
they
say
at
least
to
show
a
brilliant
and
unusual
aptitude
for
learning
i
don
t
know
precisely
why
but
he
left
the
family
of
yefim
petrovitch
when
he
was
hardly
thirteen
entering
a
moscow
gymnasium
and
boarding
with
an
experienced
and
celebrated
teacher
an
old
friend
of
yefim
petrovitch
ivan
used
to
declare
afterwards
that
this
was
all
due
to
the
ardor
for
good
works
of
yefim
petrovitch
who
was
captivated
by
the
idea
that
the
boy
s
genius
should
be
trained
by
a
teacher
of
genius
but
neither
yefim
petrovitch
nor
this
teacher
was
living
when
the
young
man
finished
at
the
gymnasium
and
entered
the
university
as
yefim
petrovitch
had
made
no
provision
for
the
payment
of
the
tyrannical
old
lady
s
legacy
which
had
grown
from
one
thousand
to
two
it
was
delayed
owing
to
formalities
inevitable
in
russia
and
the
young
man
was
in
great
straits
for
the
first
two
years
at
the
university
as
he
was
forced
to
keep
himself
all
the
time
he
was
studying
it
must
be
noted
that
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
communicate
with
his
father
perhaps
from
pride
from
contempt
for
him
or
perhaps
from
his
cool
common
sense
which
told
him
that
from
such
a
father
he
would
get
no
real
assistance
however
that
may
have
been
the
young
man
was
by
no
means
despondent
and
succeeded
in
getting
work
at
first
giving
sixpenny
lessons
and
afterwards
getting
paragraphs
on
street
incidents
into
the
newspapers
under
the
signature
of
eye
witness
these
paragraphs
it
was
said
were
so
interesting
and
piquant
that
they
were
soon
taken
this
alone
showed
the
young
man
s
practical
and
intellectual
superiority
over
the
masses
of
needy
and
unfortunate
students
of
both
sexes
who
hang
about
the
offices
of
the
newspapers
and
journals
unable
to
think
of
anything
better
than
everlasting
entreaties
for
copying
and
translations
from
the
french
having
once
got
into
touch
with
the
editors
ivan
fyodorovitch
always
kept
up
his
connection
with
them
and
in
his
latter
years
at
the
university
he
published
brilliant
reviews
of
books
upon
various
special
subjects
so
that
he
became
well
known
in
literary
circles
but
only
in
his
last
year
he
suddenly
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
a
far
wider
circle
of
readers
so
that
a
great
many
people
noticed
and
remembered
him
it
was
rather
a
curious
incident
when
he
had
just
left
the
university
and
was
preparing
to
go
abroad
upon
his
two
thousand
roubles
ivan
fyodorovitch
published
in
one
of
the
more
important
journals
a
strange
article
which
attracted
general
notice
on
a
subject
of
which
he
might
have
been
supposed
to
know
nothing
as
he
was
a
student
of
natural
science
the
article
dealt
with
a
subject
which
was
being
debated
everywhere
at
the
time
the
position
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
after
discussing
several
opinions
on
the
subject
he
went
on
to
explain
his
own
view
what
was
most
striking
about
the
article
was
its
tone
and
its
unexpected
conclusion
many
of
the
church
party
regarded
him
unquestioningly
as
on
their
side
and
yet
not
only
the
secularists
but
even
atheists
joined
them
in
their
applause
finally
some
sagacious
persons
opined
that
the
article
was
nothing
but
an
impudent
satirical
burlesque
i
mention
this
incident
particularly
because
this
article
penetrated
into
the
famous
monastery
in
our
neighborhood
where
the
inmates
being
particularly
interested
in
the
question
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
were
completely
bewildered
by
it
learning
the
author
s
name
they
were
interested
in
his
being
a
native
of
the
town
and
the
son
of
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
just
then
it
was
that
the
author
himself
made
his
appearance
among
us
why
ivan
fyodorovitch
had
come
amongst
us
i
remember
asking
myself
at
the
time
with
a
certain
uneasiness
this
fateful
visit
which
was
the
first
step
leading
to
so
many
consequences
i
never
fully
explained
to
myself
it
seemed
strange
on
the
face
of
it
that
a
young
man
so
learned
so
proud
and
apparently
so
cautious
should
suddenly
visit
such
an
infamous
house
and
a
father
who
had
ignored
him
all
his
life
hardly
knew
him
never
thought
of
him
and
would
not
under
any
circumstances
have
given
him
money
though
he
was
always
afraid
that
his
sons
ivan
and
alexey
would
also
come
to
ask
him
for
it
and
here
the
young
man
was
staying
in
the
house
of
such
a
father
had
been
living
with
him
for
two
months
and
they
were
on
the
best
possible
terms
this
last
fact
was
a
special
cause
of
wonder
to
many
others
as
well
as
to
me
pyotr
alexandrovitch
mi
sov
of
whom
we
have
spoken
already
the
cousin
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
first
wife
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
again
on
a
visit
to
his
estate
he
had
come
from
paris
which
was
his
permanent
home
i
remember
that
he
was
more
surprised
than
any
one
when
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
young
man
who
interested
him
extremely
and
with
whom
he
sometimes
argued
and
not
without
an
inner
pang
compared
himself
in
acquirements
he
is
proud
he
used
to
say
he
will
never
be
in
want
of
pence
he
has
got
money
enough
to
go
abroad
now
what
does
he
want
here
every
one
can
see
that
he
hasn
t
come
for
money
for
his
father
would
never
give
him
any
he
has
no
taste
for
drink
and
dissipation
and
yet
his
father
can
t
do
without
him
they
get
on
so
well
together
that
was
the
truth
the
young
man
had
an
unmistakable
influence
over
his
father
who
positively
appeared
to
be
behaving
more
decently
and
even
seemed
at
times
ready
to
obey
his
son
though
often
extremely
and
even
spitefully
perverse
it
was
only
later
that
we
learned
that
ivan
had
come
partly
at
the
request
of
and
in
the
interests
of
his
elder
brother
dmitri
whom
he
saw
for
the
first
time
on
this
very
visit
though
he
had
before
leaving
moscow
been
in
correspondence
with
him
about
an
important
matter
of
more
concern
to
dmitri
than
himself
what
that
business
was
the
reader
will
learn
fully
in
due
time
yet
even
when
i
did
know
of
this
special
circumstance
i
still
felt
ivan
fyodorovitch
to
be
an
enigmatic
figure
and
thought
his
visit
rather
mysterious
i
may
add
that
ivan
appeared
at
the
time
in
the
light
of
a
mediator
between
his
father
and
his
elder
brother
dmitri
who
was
in
open
quarrel
with
his
father
and
even
planning
to
bring
an
action
against
him
the
family
i
repeat
was
now
united
for
the
first
time
and
some
of
its
members
met
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
the
younger
brother
alexey
had
been
a
year
already
among
us
having
been
the
first
of
the
three
to
arrive
it
is
of
that
brother
alexey
i
find
it
most
difficult
to
speak
in
this
introduction
yet
i
must
give
some
preliminary
account
of
him
if
only
to
explain
one
queer
fact
which
is
that
i
have
to
introduce
my
hero
to
the
reader
wearing
the
cassock
of
a
novice
yes
he
had
been
for
the
last
year
in
our
monastery
and
seemed
willing
to
be
cloistered
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
chapter
iv
the
third
son
alyosha
he
was
only
twenty
his
brother
ivan
was
in
his
twenty
fourth
year
at
the
time
while
their
elder
brother
dmitri
was
twenty
seven
first
of
all
i
must
explain
that
this
young
man
alyosha
was
not
a
fanatic
and
in
my
opinion
at
least
was
not
even
a
mystic
i
may
as
well
give
my
full
opinion
from
the
beginning
he
was
simply
an
early
lover
of
humanity
and
that
he
adopted
the
monastic
life
was
simply
because
at
that
time
it
struck
him
so
to
say
as
the
ideal
escape
for
his
soul
struggling
from
the
darkness
of
worldly
wickedness
to
the
light
of
love
and
the
reason
this
life
struck
him
in
this
way
was
that
he
found
in
it
at
that
time
as
he
thought
an
extraordinary
being
our
celebrated
elder
zossima
to
whom
he
became
attached
with
all
the
warm
first
love
of
his
ardent
heart
but
i
do
not
dispute
that
he
was
very
strange
even
at
that
time
and
had
been
so
indeed
from
his
cradle
i
have
mentioned
already
by
the
way
that
though
he
lost
his
mother
in
his
fourth
year
he
remembered
her
all
his
life
her
face
her
caresses
as
though
she
stood
living
before
me
such
memories
may
persist
as
every
one
knows
from
an
even
earlier
age
even
from
two
years
old
but
scarcely
standing
out
through
a
whole
lifetime
like
spots
of
light
out
of
darkness
like
a
corner
torn
out
of
a
huge
picture
which
has
all
faded
and
disappeared
except
that
fragment
that
is
how
it
was
with
him
he
remembered
one
still
summer
evening
an
open
window
the
slanting
rays
of
the
setting
sun
that
he
recalled
most
vividly
of
all
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
holy
image
before
it
a
lighted
lamp
and
on
her
knees
before
the
image
his
mother
sobbing
hysterically
with
cries
and
moans
snatching
him
up
in
both
arms
squeezing
him
close
till
it
hurt
and
praying
for
him
to
the
mother
of
god
holding
him
out
in
both
arms
to
the
image
as
though
to
put
him
under
the
mother
s
protection
and
suddenly
a
nurse
runs
in
and
snatches
him
from
her
in
terror
that
was
the
picture
and
alyosha
remembered
his
mother
s
face
at
that
minute
he
used
to
say
that
it
was
frenzied
but
beautiful
as
he
remembered
but
he
rarely
cared
to
speak
of
this
memory
to
any
one
in
his
childhood
and
youth
he
was
by
no
means
expansive
and
talked
little
indeed
but
not
from
shyness
or
a
sullen
unsociability
quite
the
contrary
from
something
different
from
a
sort
of
inner
preoccupation
entirely
personal
and
unconcerned
with
other
people
but
so
important
to
him
that
he
seemed
as
it
were
to
forget
others
on
account
of
it
but
he
was
fond
of
people
he
seemed
throughout
his
life
to
put
implicit
trust
in
people
yet
no
one
ever
looked
on
him
as
a
simpleton
or
na
ve
person
there
was
something
about
him
which
made
one
feel
at
once
and
it
was
so
all
his
life
afterwards
that
he
did
not
care
to
be
a
judge
of
others
that
he
would
never
take
it
upon
himself
to
criticize
and
would
never
condemn
any
one
for
anything
he
seemed
indeed
to
accept
everything
without
the
least
condemnation
though
often
grieving
bitterly
and
this
was
so
much
so
that
no
one
could
surprise
or
frighten
him
even
in
his
earliest
youth
coming
at
twenty
to
his
father
s
house
which
was
a
very
sink
of
filthy
debauchery
he
chaste
and
pure
as
he
was
simply
withdrew
in
silence
when
to
look
on
was
unbearable
but
without
the
slightest
sign
of
contempt
or
condemnation
his
father
who
had
once
been
in
a
dependent
position
and
so
was
sensitive
and
ready
to
take
offense
met
him
at
first
with
distrust
and
sullenness
he
does
not
say
much
he
used
to
say
and
thinks
the
more
but
soon
within
a
fortnight
indeed
he
took
to
embracing
him
and
kissing
him
terribly
often
with
drunken
tears
with
sottish
sentimentality
yet
he
evidently
felt
a
real
and
deep
affection
for
him
such
as
he
had
never
been
capable
of
feeling
for
any
one
before
every
one
indeed
loved
this
young
man
wherever
he
went
and
it
was
so
from
his
earliest
childhood
when
he
entered
the
household
of
his
patron
and
benefactor
yefim
petrovitch
polenov
he
gained
the
hearts
of
all
the
family
so
that
they
looked
on
him
quite
as
their
own
child
yet
he
entered
the
house
at
such
a
tender
age
that
he
could
not
have
acted
from
design
nor
artfulness
in
winning
affection
so
that
the
gift
of
making
himself
loved
directly
and
unconsciously
was
inherent
in
him
in
his
very
nature
so
to
speak
it
was
the
same
at
school
though
he
seemed
to
be
just
one
of
those
children
who
are
distrusted
sometimes
ridiculed
and
even
disliked
by
their
schoolfellows
he
was
dreamy
for
instance
and
rather
solitary
from
his
earliest
childhood
he
was
fond
of
creeping
into
a
corner
to
read
and
yet
he
was
a
general
favorite
all
the
while
he
was
at
school
he
was
rarely
playful
or
merry
but
any
one
could
see
at
the
first
glance
that
this
was
not
from
any
sullenness
on
the
contrary
he
was
bright
and
good
tempered
he
never
tried
to
show
off
among
his
schoolfellows
perhaps
because
of
this
he
was
never
afraid
of
any
one
yet
the
boys
immediately
understood
that
he
was
not
proud
of
his
fearlessness
and
seemed
to
be
unaware
that
he
was
bold
and
courageous
he
never
resented
an
insult
it
would
happen
that
an
hour
after
the
offense
he
would
address
the
offender
or
answer
some
question
with
as
trustful
and
candid
an
expression
as
though
nothing
had
happened
between
them
and
it
was
not
that
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
or
intentionally
forgiven
the
affront
but
simply
that
he
did
not
regard
it
as
an
affront
and
this
completely
conquered
and
captivated
the
boys
he
had
one
characteristic
which
made
all
his
schoolfellows
from
the
bottom
class
to
the
top
want
to
mock
at
him
not
from
malice
but
because
it
amused
them
this
characteristic
was
a
wild
fanatical
modesty
and
chastity
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
certain
words
and
certain
conversations
about
women
there
are
certain
words
and
conversations
unhappily
impossible
to
eradicate
in
schools
boys
pure
in
mind
and
heart
almost
children
are
fond
of
talking
in
school
among
themselves
and
even
aloud
of
things
pictures
and
images
of
which
even
soldiers
would
sometimes
hesitate
to
speak
more
than
that
much
that
soldiers
have
no
knowledge
or
conception
of
is
familiar
to
quite
young
children
of
our
intellectual
and
higher
classes
there
is
no
moral
depravity
no
real
corrupt
inner
cynicism
in
it
but
there
is
the
appearance
of
it
and
it
is
often
looked
upon
among
them
as
something
refined
subtle
daring
and
worthy
of
imitation
seeing
that
alyosha
karamazov
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
when
they
talked
of
that
they
used
sometimes
to
crowd
round
him
pull
his
hands
away
and
shout
nastiness
into
both
ears
while
he
struggled
slipped
to
the
floor
tried
to
hide
himself
without
uttering
one
word
of
abuse
enduring
their
insults
in
silence
but
at
last
they
left
him
alone
and
gave
up
taunting
him
with
being
a
regular
girl
and
what
s
more
they
looked
upon
it
with
compassion
as
a
weakness
he
was
always
one
of
the
best
in
the
class
but
was
never
first
at
the
time
of
yefim
petrovitch
s
death
alyosha
had
two
more
years
to
complete
at
the
provincial
gymnasium
the
inconsolable
widow
went
almost
immediately
after
his
death
for
a
long
visit
to
italy
with
her
whole
family
which
consisted
only
of
women
and
girls
alyosha
went
to
live
in
the
house
of
two
distant
relations
of
yefim
petrovitch
ladies
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
on
what
terms
he
lived
with
them
he
did
not
know
himself
it
was
very
characteristic
of
him
indeed
that
he
never
cared
at
whose
expense
he
was
living
in
that
respect
he
was
a
striking
contrast
to
his
elder
brother
ivan
who
struggled
with
poverty
for
his
first
two
years
in
the
university
maintained
himself
by
his
own
efforts
and
had
from
childhood
been
bitterly
conscious
of
living
at
the
expense
of
his
benefactor
but
this
strange
trait
in
alyosha
s
character
must
not
i
think
be
criticized
too
severely
for
at
the
slightest
acquaintance
with
him
any
one
would
have
perceived
that
alyosha
was
one
of
those
youths
almost
of
the
type
of
religious
enthusiast
who
if
they
were
suddenly
to
come
into
possession
of
a
large
fortune
would
not
hesitate
to
give
it
away
for
the
asking
either
for
good
works
or
perhaps
to
a
clever
rogue
in
general
he
seemed
scarcely
to
know
the
value
of
money
not
of
course
in
a
literal
sense
when
he
was
given
pocket
money
which
he
never
asked
for
he
was
either
terribly
careless
of
it
so
that
it
was
gone
in
a
moment
or
he
kept
it
for
weeks
together
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
in
later
years
pyotr
alexandrovitch
mi
sov
a
man
very
sensitive
on
the
score
of
money
and
bourgeois
honesty
pronounced
the
following
judgment
after
getting
to
know
alyosha
here
is
perhaps
the
one
man
in
the
world
whom
you
might
leave
alone
without
a
penny
in
the
center
of
an
unknown
town
of
a
million
inhabitants
and
he
would
not
come
to
harm
he
would
not
die
of
cold
and
hunger
for
he
would
be
fed
and
sheltered
at
once
and
if
he
were
not
he
would
find
a
shelter
for
himself
and
it
would
cost
him
no
effort
or
humiliation
and
to
shelter
him
would
be
no
burden
but
on
the
contrary
would
probably
be
looked
on
as
a
pleasure
he
did
not
finish
his
studies
at
the
gymnasium
a
year
before
the
end
of
the
course
he
suddenly
announced
to
the
ladies
that
he
was
going
to
see
his
father
about
a
plan
which
had
occurred
to
him
they
were
sorry
and
unwilling
to
let
him
go
the
journey
was
not
an
expensive
one
and
the
ladies
would
not
let
him
pawn
his
watch
a
parting
present
from
his
benefactor
s
family
they
provided
him
liberally
with
money
and
even
fitted
him
out
with
new
clothes
and
linen
but
he
returned
half
the
money
they
gave
him
saying
that
he
intended
to
go
third
class
on
his
arrival
in
the
town
he
made
no
answer
to
his
father
s
first
inquiry
why
he
had
come
before
completing
his
studies
and
seemed
so
they
say
unusually
thoughtful
it
soon
became
apparent
that
he
was
looking
for
his
mother
s
tomb
he
practically
acknowledged
at
the
time
that
that
was
the
only
object
of
his
visit
but
it
can
hardly
have
been
the
whole
reason
of
it
it
is
more
probable
that
he
himself
did
not
understand
and
could
not
explain
what
had
suddenly
arisen
in
his
soul
and
drawn
him
irresistibly
into
a
new
unknown
but
inevitable
path
fyodor
pavlovitch
could
not
show
him
where
his
second
wife
was
buried
for
he
had
never
visited
her
grave
since
he
had
thrown
earth
upon
her
coffin
and
in
the
course
of
years
had
entirely
forgotten
where
she
was
buried
fyodor
pavlovitch
by
the
way
had
for
some
time
previously
not
been
living
in
our
town
three
or
four
years
after
his
wife
s
death
he
had
gone
to
the
south
of
russia
and
finally
turned
up
in
odessa
where
he
spent
several
years
he
made
the
acquaintance
at
first
in
his
own
words
of
a
lot
of
low
jews
jewesses
and
jewkins
and
ended
by
being
received
by
jews
high
and
low
alike
it
may
be
presumed
that
at
this
period
he
developed
a
peculiar
faculty
for
making
and
hoarding
money
he
finally
returned
to
our
town
only
three
years
before
alyosha
s
arrival
his
former
acquaintances
found
him
looking
terribly
aged
although
he
was
by
no
means
an
old
man
he
behaved
not
exactly
with
more
dignity
but
with
more
effrontery
the
former
buffoon
showed
an
insolent
propensity
for
making
buffoons
of
others
his
depravity
with
women
was
not
simply
what
it
used
to
be
but
even
more
revolting
in
a
short
time
he
opened
a
great
number
of
new
taverns
in
the
district
it
was
evident
that
he
had
perhaps
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
or
not
much
less
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
and
district
were
soon
in
his
debt
and
of
course
had
given
good
security
of
late
too
he
looked
somehow
bloated
and
seemed
more
irresponsible
more
uneven
had
sunk
into
a
sort
of
incoherence
used
to
begin
one
thing
and
go
on
with
another
as
though
he
were
letting
himself
go
altogether
he
was
more
and
more
frequently
drunk
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
same
servant
grigory
who
by
that
time
had
aged
considerably
too
and
used
to
look
after
him
sometimes
almost
like
a
tutor
fyodor
pavlovitch
might
have
got
into
terrible
scrapes
alyosha
s
arrival
seemed
to
affect
even
his
moral
side
as
though
something
had
awakened
in
this
prematurely
old
man
which
had
long
been
dead
in
his
soul
do
you
know
he
used
often
to
say
looking
at
alyosha
that
you
are
like
her
the
crazy
woman
that
was
what
he
used
to
call
his
dead
wife
alyosha
s
mother
grigory
it
was
who
pointed
out
the
crazy
woman
s
grave
to
alyosha
he
took
him
to
our
town
cemetery
and
showed
him
in
a
remote
corner
a
cast
iron
tombstone
cheap
but
decently
kept
on
which
were
inscribed
the
name
and
age
of
the
deceased
and
the
date
of
her
death
and
below
a
four
lined
verse
such
as
are
commonly
used
on
old
fashioned
middle
class
tombs
to
alyosha
s
amazement
this
tomb
turned
out
to
be
grigory
s
doing
he
had
put
it
up
on
the
poor
crazy
woman
s
grave
at
his
own
expense
after
fyodor
pavlovitch
whom
he
had
often
pestered
about
the
grave
had
gone
to
odessa
abandoning
the
grave
and
all
his
memories
alyosha
showed
no
particular
emotion
at
the
sight
of
his
mother
s
grave
he
only
listened
to
grigory
s
minute
and
solemn
account
of
the
erection
of
the
tomb
he
stood
with
bowed
head
and
walked
away
without
uttering
a
word
it
was
perhaps
a
year
before
he
visited
the
cemetery
again
but
this
little
episode
was
not
without
an
influence
upon
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
a
very
original
one
he
suddenly
took
a
thousand
roubles
to
our
monastery
to
pay
for
requiems
for
the
soul
of
his
wife
but
not
for
the
second
alyosha
s
mother
the
crazy
woman
but
for
the
first
adela
da
ivanovna
who
used
to
thrash
him
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
got
drunk
and
abused
the
monks
to
alyosha
he
himself
was
far
from
being
religious
he
had
probably
never
put
a
penny
candle
before
the
image
of
a
saint
strange
impulses
of
sudden
feeling
and
sudden
thought
are
common
in
such
types
i
have
mentioned
already
that
he
looked
bloated
his
countenance
at
this
time
bore
traces
of
something
that
testified
unmistakably
to
the
life
he
had
led
besides
the
long
fleshy
bags
under
his
little
always
insolent
suspicious
and
ironical
eyes
besides
the
multitude
of
deep
wrinkles
in
his
little
fat
face
the
adam
s
apple
hung
below
his
sharp
chin
like
a
great
fleshy
goiter
which
gave
him
a
peculiar
repulsive
sensual
appearance
add
to
that
a
long
rapacious
mouth
with
full
lips
between
which
could
be
seen
little
stumps
of
black
decayed
teeth
he
slobbered
every
time
he
began
to
speak
he
was
fond
indeed
of
making
fun
of
his
own
face
though
i
believe
he
was
well
satisfied
with
it
he
used
particularly
to
point
to
his
nose
which
was
not
very
large
but
very
delicate
and
conspicuously
aquiline
a
regular
roman
nose
he
used
to
say
with
my
goiter
i
ve
quite
the
countenance
of
an
ancient
roman
patrician
of
the
decadent
period
he
seemed
proud
of
it
not
long
after
visiting
his
mother
s
grave
alyosha
suddenly
announced
that
he
wanted
to
enter
the
monastery
and
that
the
monks
were
willing
to
receive
him
as
a
novice
he
explained
that
this
was
his
strong
desire
and
that
he
was
solemnly
asking
his
consent
as
his
father
the
old
man
knew
that
the
elder
zossima
who
was
living
in
the
monastery
hermitage
had
made
a
special
impression
upon
his
gentle
boy
that
is
the
most
honest
monk
among
them
of
course
he
observed
after
listening
in
thoughtful
silence
to
alyosha
and
seeming
scarcely
surprised
at
his
request
h
m
so
that
s
where
you
want
to
be
my
gentle
boy
he
was
half
drunk
and
suddenly
he
grinned
his
slow
half
drunken
grin
which
was
not
without
a
certain
cunning
and
tipsy
slyness
h
m
i
had
a
presentiment
that
you
would
end
in
something
like
this
would
you
believe
it
you
were
making
straight
for
it
well
to
be
sure
you
have
your
own
two
thousand
that
s
a
dowry
for
you
and
i
ll
never
desert
you
my
angel
and
i
ll
pay
what
s
wanted
for
you
there
if
they
ask
for
it
but
of
course
if
they
don
t
ask
why
should
we
worry
them
what
do
you
say
you
know
you
spend
money
like
a
canary
two
grains
a
week
h
m
do
you
know
that
near
one
monastery
there
s
a
place
outside
the
town
where
every
baby
knows
there
are
none
but
the
monks
wives
living
as
they
are
called
thirty
women
i
believe
i
have
been
there
myself
you
know
it
s
interesting
in
its
own
way
of
course
as
a
variety
the
worst
of
it
is
it
s
awfully
russian
there
are
no
french
women
there
of
course
they
could
get
them
fast
enough
they
have
plenty
of
money
if
they
get
to
hear
of
it
they
ll
come
along
well
there
s
nothing
of
that
sort
here
no
monks
wives
and
two
hundred
monks
they
re
honest
they
keep
the
fasts
i
admit
it
h
m
so
you
want
to
be
a
monk
and
do
you
know
i
m
sorry
to
lose
you
alyosha
would
you
believe
it
i
ve
really
grown
fond
of
you
well
it
s
a
good
opportunity
you
ll
pray
for
us
sinners
we
have
sinned
too
much
here
i
ve
always
been
thinking
who
would
pray
for
me
and
whether
there
s
any
one
in
the
world
to
do
it
my
dear
boy
i
m
awfully
stupid
about
that
you
wouldn
t
believe
it
awfully
you
see
however
stupid
i
am
about
it
i
keep
thinking
i
keep
thinking
from
time
to
time
of
course
not
all
the
while
it
s
impossible
i
think
for
the
devils
to
forget
to
drag
me
down
to
hell
with
their
hooks
when
i
die
then
i
wonder
hooks
where
would
they
get
them
what
of
iron
hooks
where
do
they
forge
them
have
they
a
foundry
there
of
some
sort
the
monks
in
the
monastery
probably
believe
that
there
s
a
ceiling
in
hell
for
instance
now
i
m
ready
to
believe
in
hell
but
without
a
ceiling
it
makes
it
more
refined
more
enlightened
more
lutheran
that
is
and
after
all
what
does
it
matter
whether
it
has
a
ceiling
or
hasn
t
but
do
you
know
there
s
a
damnable
question
involved
in
it
if
there
s
no
ceiling
there
can
be
no
hooks
and
if
there
are
no
hooks
it
all
breaks
down
which
is
unlikely
again
for
then
there
would
be
none
to
drag
me
down
to
hell
and
if
they
don
t
drag
me
down
what
justice
is
there
in
the
world
il
faudrait
les
inventer
those
hooks
on
purpose
for
me
alone
for
if
you
only
knew
alyosha
what
a
blackguard
i
am
but
there
are
no
hooks
there
said
alyosha
looking
gently
and
seriously
at
his
father
yes
yes
only
the
shadows
of
hooks
i
know
i
know
that
s
how
a
frenchman
described
hell
j
ai
bu
l
ombre
d
un
cocher
qui
avec
l
ombre
d
une
brosse
frottait
l
ombre
d
une
carrosse
how
do
you
know
there
are
no
hooks
darling
when
you
ve
lived
with
the
monks
you
ll
sing
a
different
tune
but
go
and
get
at
the
truth
there
and
then
come
and
tell
me
anyway
it
s
easier
going
to
the
other
world
if
one
knows
what
there
is
there
besides
it
will
be
more
seemly
for
you
with
the
monks
than
here
with
me
with
a
drunken
old
man
and
young
harlots
though
you
re
like
an
angel
nothing
touches
you
and
i
dare
say
nothing
will
touch
you
there
that
s
why
i
let
you
go
because
i
hope
for
that
you
ve
got
all
your
wits
about
you
you
will
burn
and
you
will
burn
out
you
will
be
healed
and
come
back
again
and
i
will
wait
for
you
i
feel
that
you
re
the
only
creature
in
the
world
who
has
not
condemned
me
my
dear
boy
i
feel
it
you
know
i
can
t
help
feeling
it
and
he
even
began
blubbering
he
was
sentimental
he
was
wicked
and
sentimental
chapter
v
elders
some
of
my
readers
may
imagine
that
my
young
man
was
a
sickly
ecstatic
poorly
developed
creature
a
pale
consumptive
dreamer
on
the
contrary
alyosha
was
at
this
time
a
well
grown
red
cheeked
clear
eyed
lad
of
nineteen
radiant
with
health
he
was
very
handsome
too
graceful
moderately
tall
with
hair
of
a
dark
brown
with
a
regular
rather
long
oval
shaped
face
and
wide
set
dark
gray
shining
eyes
he
was
very
thoughtful
and
apparently
very
serene
i
shall
be
told
perhaps
that
red
cheeks
are
not
incompatible
with
fanaticism
and
mysticism
but
i
fancy
that
alyosha
was
more
of
a
realist
than
any
one
oh
no
doubt
in
the
monastery
he
fully
believed
in
miracles
but
to
my
thinking
miracles
are
never
a
stumbling
block
to
the
realist
it
is
not
miracles
that
dispose
realists
to
belief
the
genuine
realist
if
he
is
an
unbeliever
will
always
find
strength
and
ability
to
disbelieve
in
the
miraculous
and
if
he
is
confronted
with
a
miracle
as
an
irrefutable
fact
he
would
rather
disbelieve
his
own
senses
than
admit
the
fact
even
if
he
admits
it
he
admits
it
as
a
fact
of
nature
till
then
unrecognized
by
him
faith
does
not
in
the
realist
spring
from
the
miracle
but
the
miracle
from
faith
if
the
realist
once
believes
then
he
is
bound
by
his
very
realism
to
admit
the
miraculous
also
the
apostle
thomas
said
that
he
would
not
believe
till
he
saw
but
when
he
did
see
he
said
my
lord
and
my
god
was
it
the
miracle
forced
him
to
believe
most
likely
not
but
he
believed
solely
because
he
desired
to
believe
and
possibly
he
fully
believed
in
his
secret
heart
even
when
he
said
i
do
not
believe
till
i
see
i
shall
be
told
perhaps
that
alyosha
was
stupid
undeveloped
had
not
finished
his
studies
and
so
on
that
he
did
not
finish
his
studies
is
true
but
to
say
that
he
was
stupid
or
dull
would
be
a
great
injustice
i
ll
simply
repeat
what
i
have
said
above
he
entered
upon
this
path
only
because
at
that
time
it
alone
struck
his
imagination
and
presented
itself
to
him
as
offering
an
ideal
means
of
escape
for
his
soul
from
darkness
to
light
add
to
that
that
he
was
to
some
extent
a
youth
of
our
last
epoch
that
is
honest
in
nature
desiring
the
truth
seeking
for
it
and
believing
in
it
and
seeking
to
serve
it
at
once
with
all
the
strength
of
his
soul
seeking
for
immediate
action
and
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
life
itself
for
it
though
these
young
men
unhappily
fail
to
understand
that
the
sacrifice
of
life
is
in
many
cases
the
easiest
of
all
sacrifices
and
that
to
sacrifice
for
instance
five
or
six
years
of
their
seething
youth
to
hard
and
tedious
study
if
only
to
multiply
tenfold
their
powers
of
serving
the
truth
and
the
cause
they
have
set
before
them
as
their
goal
such
a
sacrifice
is
utterly
beyond
the
strength
of
many
of
them
the
path
alyosha
chose
was
a
path
going
in
the
opposite
direction
but
he
chose
it
with
the
same
thirst
for
swift
achievement
as
soon
as
he
reflected
seriously
he
was
convinced
of
the
existence
of
god
and
immortality
and
at
once
he
instinctively
said
to
himself
i
want
to
live
for
immortality
and
i
will
accept
no
compromise
in
the
same
way
if
he
had
decided
that
god
and
immortality
did
not
exist
he
would
at
once
have
become
an
atheist
and
a
socialist
for
socialism
is
not
merely
the
labor
question
it
is
before
all
things
the
atheistic
question
the
question
of
the
form
taken
by
atheism
to
day
the
question
of
the
tower
of
babel
built
without
god
not
to
mount
to
heaven
from
earth
but
to
set
up
heaven
on
earth
alyosha
would
have
found
it
strange
and
impossible
to
go
on
living
as
before
it
is
written
give
all
that
thou
hast
to
the
poor
and
follow
me
if
thou
wouldst
be
perfect
alyosha
said
to
himself
i
can
t
give
two
roubles
instead
of
all
and
only
go
to
mass
instead
of
following
him
perhaps
his
memories
of
childhood
brought
back
our
monastery
to
which
his
mother
may
have
taken
him
to
mass
perhaps
the
slanting
sunlight
and
the
holy
image
to
which
his
poor
crazy
mother
had
held
him
up
still
acted
upon
his
imagination
brooding
on
these
things
he
may
have
come
to
us
perhaps
only
to
see
whether
here
he
could
sacrifice
all
or
only
two
roubles
and
in
the
monastery
he
met
this
elder
i
must
digress
to
explain
what
an
elder
is
in
russian
monasteries
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
do
not
feel
very
competent
to
do
so
i
will
try
however
to
give
a
superficial
account
of
it
in
a
few
words
authorities
on
the
subject
assert
that
the
institution
of
elders
is
of
recent
date
not
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
in
our
monasteries
though
in
the
orthodox
east
especially
in
sinai
and
athos
it
has
existed
over
a
thousand
years
it
is
maintained
that
it
existed
in
ancient
times
in
russia
also
but
through
the
calamities
which
overtook
russia
the
tartars
civil
war
the
interruption
of
relations
with
the
east
after
the
destruction
of
constantinople
this
institution
fell
into
oblivion
it
was
revived
among
us
towards
the
end
of
last
century
by
one
of
the
great
ascetics
as
they
called
him
pa
ssy
velitchkovsky
and
his
disciples
but
to
this
day
it
exists
in
few
monasteries
only
and
has
sometimes
been
almost
persecuted
as
an
innovation
in
russia
it
flourished
especially
in
the
celebrated
kozelski
optin
monastery
when
and
how
it
was
introduced
into
our
monastery
i
cannot
say
there
had
already
been
three
such
elders
and
zossima
was
the
last
of
them
but
he
was
almost
dying
of
weakness
and
disease
and
they
had
no
one
to
take
his
place
the
question
for
our
monastery
was
an
important
one
for
it
had
not
been
distinguished
by
anything
in
particular
till
then
they
had
neither
relics
of
saints
nor
wonder
working
ikons
nor
glorious
traditions
nor
historical
exploits
it
had
flourished
and
been
glorious
all
over
russia
through
its
elders
to
see
and
hear
whom
pilgrims
had
flocked
for
thousands
of
miles
from
all
parts
what
was
such
an
elder
an
elder
was
one
who
took
your
soul
your
will
into
his
soul
and
his
will
when
you
choose
an
elder
you
renounce
your
own
will
and
yield
it
to
him
in
complete
submission
complete
self
abnegation
this
novitiate
this
terrible
school
of
abnegation
is
undertaken
voluntarily
in
the
hope
of
self
conquest
of
self
mastery
in
order
after
a
life
of
obedience
to
attain
perfect
freedom
that
is
from
self
to
escape
the
lot
of
those
who
have
lived
their
whole
life
without
finding
their
true
selves
in
themselves
this
institution
of
elders
is
not
founded
on
theory
but
was
established
in
the
east
from
the
practice
of
a
thousand
years
the
obligations
due
to
an
elder
are
not
the
ordinary
obedience
which
has
always
existed
in
our
russian
monasteries
the
obligation
involves
confession
to
the
elder
by
all
who
have
submitted
themselves
to
him
and
to
the
indissoluble
bond
between
him
and
them
the
story
is
told
for
instance
that
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
one
such
novice
failing
to
fulfill
some
command
laid
upon
him
by
his
elder
left
his
monastery
in
syria
and
went
to
egypt
there
after
great
exploits
he
was
found
worthy
at
last
to
suffer
torture
and
a
martyr
s
death
for
the
faith
when
the
church
regarding
him
as
a
saint
was
burying
him
suddenly
at
the
deacon
s
exhortation
depart
all
ye
unbaptized
the
coffin
containing
the
martyr
s
body
left
its
place
and
was
cast
forth
from
the
church
and
this
took
place
three
times
and
only
at
last
they
learnt
that
this
holy
man
had
broken
his
vow
of
obedience
and
left
his
elder
and
therefore
could
not
be
forgiven
without
the
elder
s
absolution
in
spite
of
his
great
deeds
only
after
this
could
the
funeral
take
place
this
of
course
is
only
an
old
legend
but
here
is
a
recent
instance
a
monk
was
suddenly
commanded
by
his
elder
to
quit
athos
which
he
loved
as
a
sacred
place
and
a
haven
of
refuge
and
to
go
first
to
jerusalem
to
do
homage
to
the
holy
places
and
then
to
go
to
the
north
to
siberia
there
is
the
place
for
thee
and
not
here
the
monk
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
went
to
the
cumenical
patriarch
at
constantinople
and
besought
him
to
release
him
from
his
obedience
but
the
patriarch
replied
that
not
only
was
he
unable
to
release
him
but
there
was
not
and
could
not
be
on
earth
a
power
which
could
release
him
except
the
elder
who
had
himself
laid
that
duty
upon
him
in
this
way
the
elders
are
endowed
in
certain
cases
with
unbounded
and
inexplicable
authority
that
is
why
in
many
of
our
monasteries
the
institution
was
at
first
resisted
almost
to
persecution
meantime
the
elders
immediately
began
to
be
highly
esteemed
among
the
people
masses
of
the
ignorant
people
as
well
as
men
of
distinction
flocked
for
instance
to
the
elders
of
our
monastery
to
confess
their
doubts
their
sins
and
their
sufferings
and
ask
for
counsel
and
admonition
seeing
this
the
opponents
of
the
elders
declared
that
the
sacrament
of
confession
was
being
arbitrarily
and
frivolously
degraded
though
the
continual
opening
of
the
heart
to
the
elder
by
the
monk
or
the
layman
had
nothing
of
the
character
of
the
sacrament
in
the
end
however
the
institution
of
elders
has
been
retained
and
is
becoming
established
in
russian
monasteries
it
is
true
perhaps
that
this
instrument
which
had
stood
the
test
of
a
thousand
years
for
the
moral
regeneration
of
a
man
from
slavery
to
freedom
and
to
moral
perfectibility
may
be
a
two
edged
weapon
and
it
may
lead
some
not
to
humility
and
complete
self
control
but
to
the
most
satanic
pride
that
is
to
bondage
and
not
to
freedom
the
elder
zossima
was
sixty
five
he
came
of
a
family
of
landowners
had
been
in
the
army
in
early
youth
and
served
in
the
caucasus
as
an
officer
he
had
no
doubt
impressed
alyosha
by
some
peculiar
quality
of
his
soul
alyosha
lived
in
the
cell
of
the
elder
who
was
very
fond
of
him
and
let
him
wait
upon
him
it
must
be
noted
that
alyosha
was
bound
by
no
obligation
and
could
go
where
he
pleased
and
be
absent
for
whole
days
though
he
wore
the
monastic
dress
it
was
voluntarily
not
to
be
different
from
others
no
doubt
he
liked
to
do
so
possibly
his
youthful
imagination
was
deeply
stirred
by
the
power
and
fame
of
his
elder
it
was
said
that
so
many
people
had
for
years
past
come
to
confess
their
sins
to
father
zossima
and
to
entreat
him
for
words
of
advice
and
healing
that
he
had
acquired
the
keenest
intuition
and
could
tell
from
an
unknown
face
what
a
new
comer
wanted
and
what
was
the
suffering
on
his
conscience
he
sometimes
astounded
and
almost
alarmed
his
visitors
by
his
knowledge
of
their
secrets
before
they
had
spoken
a
word
alyosha
noticed
that
many
almost
all
went
in
to
the
elder
for
the
first
time
with
apprehension
and
uneasiness
but
came
out
with
bright
and
happy
faces
alyosha
was
particularly
struck
by
the
fact
that
father
zossima
was
not
at
all
stern
on
the
contrary
he
was
always
almost
gay
the
monks
used
to
say
that
he
was
more
drawn
to
those
who
were
more
sinful
and
the
greater
the
sinner
the
more
he
loved
him
there
were
no
doubt
up
to
the
end
of
his
life
among
the
monks
some
who
hated
and
envied
him
but
they
were
few
in
number
and
they
were
silent
though
among
them
were
some
of
great
dignity
in
the
monastery
one
for
instance
of
the
older
monks
distinguished
for
his
strict
keeping
of
fasts
and
vows
of
silence
but
the
majority
were
on
father
zossima
s
side
and
very
many
of
them
loved
him
with
all
their
hearts
warmly
and
sincerely
some
were
almost
fanatically
devoted
to
him
and
declared
though
not
quite
aloud
that
he
was
a
saint
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
and
seeing
that
his
end
was
near
they
anticipated
miracles
and
great
glory
to
the
monastery
in
the
immediate
future
from
his
relics
alyosha
had
unquestioning
faith
in
the
miraculous
power
of
the
elder
just
as
he
had
unquestioning
faith
in
the
story
of
the
coffin
that
flew
out
of
the
church
he
saw
many
who
came
with
sick
children
or
relatives
and
besought
the
elder
to
lay
hands
on
them
and
to
pray
over
them
return
shortly
after
some
the
next
day
and
falling
in
tears
at
the
elder
s
feet
thank
him
for
healing
their
sick
whether
they
had
really
been
healed
or
were
simply
better
in
the
natural
course
of
the
disease
was
a
question
which
did
not
exist
for
alyosha
for
he
fully
believed
in
the
spiritual
power
of
his
teacher
and
rejoiced
in
his
fame
in
his
glory
as
though
it
were
his
own
triumph
his
heart
throbbed
and
he
beamed
as
it
were
all
over
when
the
elder
came
out
to
the
gates
of
the
hermitage
into
the
waiting
crowd
of
pilgrims
of
the
humbler
class
who
had
flocked
from
all
parts
of
russia
on
purpose
to
see
the
elder
and
obtain
his
blessing
they
fell
down
before
him
wept
kissed
his
feet
kissed
the
earth
on
which
he
stood
and
wailed
while
the
women
held
up
their
children
to
him
and
brought
him
the
sick
possessed
with
devils
the
elder
spoke
to
them
read
a
brief
prayer
over
them
blessed
them
and
dismissed
them
of
late
he
had
become
so
weak
through
attacks
of
illness
that
he
was
sometimes
unable
to
leave
his
cell
and
the
pilgrims
waited
for
him
to
come
out
for
several
days
alyosha
did
not
wonder
why
they
loved
him
so
why
they
fell
down
before
him
and
wept
with
emotion
merely
at
seeing
his
face
oh
he
understood
that
for
the
humble
soul
of
the
russian
peasant
worn
out
by
grief
and
toil
and
still
more
by
the
everlasting
injustice
and
everlasting
sin
his
own
and
the
world
s
it
was
the
greatest
need
and
comfort
to
find
some
one
or
something
holy
to
fall
down
before
and
worship
among
us
there
is
sin
injustice
and
temptation
but
yet
somewhere
on
earth
there
is
some
one
holy
and
exalted
he
has
the
truth
he
knows
the
truth
so
it
is
not
dead
upon
the
earth
so
it
will
come
one
day
to
us
too
and
rule
over
all
the
earth
according
to
the
promise
alyosha
knew
that
this
was
just
how
the
people
felt
and
even
reasoned
he
understood
it
but
that
the
elder
zossima
was
this
saint
and
custodian
of
god
s
truth
of
that
he
had
no
more
doubt
than
the
weeping
peasants
and
the
sick
women
who
held
out
their
children
to
the
elder
the
conviction
that
after
his
death
the
elder
would
bring
extraordinary
glory
to
the
monastery
was
even
stronger
in
alyosha
than
in
any
one
there
and
of
late
a
kind
of
deep
flame
of
inner
ecstasy
burnt
more
and
more
strongly
in
his
heart
he
was
not
at
all
troubled
at
this
elder
s
standing
as
a
solitary
example
before
him
no
matter
he
is
holy
he
carries
in
his
heart
the
secret
of
renewal
for
all
that
power
which
will
at
last
establish
truth
on
the
earth
and
all
men
will
be
holy
and
love
one
another
and
there
will
be
no
more
rich
nor
poor
no
exalted
nor
humbled
but
all
will
be
as
the
children
of
god
and
the
true
kingdom
of
christ
will
come
that
was
the
dream
in
alyosha
s
heart
the
arrival
of
his
two
brothers
whom
he
had
not
known
till
then
seemed
to
make
a
great
impression
on
alyosha
he
more
quickly
made
friends
with
his
half
brother
dmitri
though
he
arrived
later
than
with
his
own
brother
ivan
he
was
extremely
interested
in
his
brother
ivan
but
when
the
latter
had
been
two
months
in
the
town
though
they
had
met
fairly
often
they
were
still
not
intimate
alyosha
was
naturally
silent
and
he
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
ashamed
about
something
while
his
brother
ivan
though
alyosha
noticed
at
first
that
he
looked
long
and
curiously
at
him
seemed
soon
to
have
left
off
thinking
of
him
alyosha
noticed
it
with
some
embarrassment
he
ascribed
his
brother
s
indifference
at
first
to
the
disparity
of
their
age
and
education
but
he
also
wondered
whether
the
absence
of
curiosity
and
sympathy
in
ivan
might
be
due
to
some
other
cause
entirely
unknown
to
him
he
kept
fancying
that
ivan
was
absorbed
in
something
something
inward
and
important
that
he
was
striving
towards
some
goal
perhaps
very
hard
to
attain
and
that
that
was
why
he
had
no
thought
for
him
alyosha
wondered
too
whether
there
was
not
some
contempt
on
the
part
of
the
learned
atheist
for
him
a
foolish
novice
he
knew
for
certain
that
his
brother
was
an
atheist
he
could
not
take
offense
at
this
contempt
if
it
existed
yet
with
an
uneasy
embarrassment
which
he
did
not
himself
understand
he
waited
for
his
brother
to
come
nearer
to
him
dmitri
used
to
speak
of
ivan
with
the
deepest
respect
and
with
a
peculiar
earnestness
from
him
alyosha
learnt
all
the
details
of
the
important
affair
which
had
of
late
formed
such
a
close
and
remarkable
bond
between
the
two
elder
brothers
dmitri
s
enthusiastic
references
to
ivan
were
the
more
striking
in
alyosha
s
eyes
since
dmitri
was
compared
with
ivan
almost
uneducated
and
the
two
brothers
were
such
a
contrast
in
personality
and
character
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
two
men
more
unlike
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
meeting
or
rather
gathering
of
the
members
of
this
inharmonious
family
took
place
in
the
cell
of
the
elder
who
had
such
an
extraordinary
influence
on
alyosha
the
pretext
for
this
gathering
was
a
false
one
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
discord
between
dmitri
and
his
father
seemed
at
its
acutest
stage
and
their
relations
had
become
insufferably
strained
fyodor
pavlovitch
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
suggest
apparently
in
joke
that
they
should
all
meet
in
father
zossima
s
cell
and
that
without
appealing
to
his
direct
intervention
they
might
more
decently
come
to
an
understanding
under
the
conciliating
influence
of
the
elder
s
presence
dmitri
who
had
never
seen
the
elder
naturally
supposed
that
his
father
was
trying
to
intimidate
him
but
as
he
secretly
blamed
himself
for
his
outbursts
of
temper
with
his
father
on
several
recent
occasions
he
accepted
the
challenge
it
must
be
noted
that
he
was
not
like
ivan
staying
with
his
father
but
living
apart
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
it
happened
that
pyotr
alexandrovitch
mi
sov
who
was
staying
in
the
district
at
the
time
caught
eagerly
at
the
idea
a
liberal
of
the
forties
and
fifties
a
freethinker
and
atheist
he
may
have
been
led
on
by
boredom
or
the
hope
of
frivolous
diversion
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
the
desire
to
see
the
monastery
and
the
holy
man
as
his
lawsuit
with
the
monastery
still
dragged
on
he
made
it
the
pretext
for
seeing
the
superior
in
order
to
attempt
to
settle
it
amicably
a
visitor
coming
with
such
laudable
intentions
might
be
received
with
more
attention
and
consideration
than
if
he
came
from
simple
curiosity
influences
from
within
the
monastery
were
brought
to
bear
on
the
elder
who
of
late
had
scarcely
left
his
cell
and
had
been
forced
by
illness
to
deny
even
his
ordinary
visitors
in
the
end
he
consented
to
see
them
and
the
day
was
fixed
who
has
made
me
a
judge
over
them
was
all
he
said
smilingly
to
alyosha
alyosha
was
much
perturbed
when
he
heard
of
the
proposed
visit
of
all
the
wrangling
quarrelsome
party
dmitri
was
the
only
one
who
could
regard
the
interview
seriously
all
the
others
would
come
from
frivolous
motives
perhaps
insulting
to
the
elder
alyosha
was
well
aware
of
that
ivan
and
mi
sov
would
come
from
curiosity
perhaps
of
the
coarsest
kind
while
his
father
might
be
contemplating
some
piece
of
buffoonery
though
he
said
nothing
alyosha
thoroughly
understood
his
father
the
boy
i
repeat
was
far
from
being
so
simple
as
every
one
thought
him
he
awaited
the
day
with
a
heavy
heart
no
doubt
he
was
always
pondering
in
his
mind
how
the
family
discord
could
be
ended
but
his
chief
anxiety
concerned
the
elder
he
trembled
for
him
for
his
glory
and
dreaded
any
affront
to
him
especially
the
refined
courteous
irony
of
mi
sov
and
the
supercilious
half
utterances
of
the
highly
educated
ivan
he
even
wanted
to
venture
on
warning
the
elder
telling
him
something
about
them
but
on
second
thoughts
said
nothing
he
only
sent
word
the
day
before
through
a
friend
to
his
brother
dmitri
that
he
loved
him
and
expected
him
to
keep
his
promise
dmitri
wondered
for
he
could
not
remember
what
he
had
promised
but
he
answered
by
letter
that
he
would
do
his
utmost
not
to
let
himself
be
provoked
by
vileness
but
that
although
he
had
a
deep
respect
for
the
elder
and
for
his
brother
ivan
he
was
convinced
that
the
meeting
was
either
a
trap
for
him
or
an
unworthy
farce
nevertheless
i
would
rather
bite
out
my
tongue
than
be
lacking
in
respect
to
the
sainted
man
whom
you
reverence
so
highly

wrote
in
conclusion
alyosha
was
not
greatly
cheered
by
the
letter

ii
an
unfortunate
gathering
chapter
i
they
arrive
at
the
monastery
it
was
a
warm
bright
day
at
the
end
of
august
the
interview
with
the
elder
had
been
fixed
for
half
past
eleven
immediately
after
late
mass
our
visitors
did
not
take
part
in
the
service
but
arrived
just
as
it
was
over
first
an
elegant
open
carriage
drawn
by
two
valuable
horses
drove
up
with
mi
sov
and
a
distant
relative
of
his
a
young
man
of
twenty
called
pyotr
fomitch
kalganov
this
young
man
was
preparing
to
enter
the
university
mi
sov
with
whom
he
was
staying
for
the
time
was
trying
to
persuade
him
to
go
abroad
to
the
university
of
zurich
or
jena
the
young
man
was
still
undecided
he
was
thoughtful
and
absent
minded
he
was
nice
looking
strongly
built
and
rather
tall
there
was
a
strange
fixity
in
his
gaze
at
times
like
all
very
absent
minded
people
he
would
sometimes
stare
at
a
person
without
seeing
him
he
was
silent
and
rather
awkward
but
sometimes
when
he
was
alone
with
any
one
he
became
talkative
and
effusive
and
would
laugh
at
anything
or
nothing
but
his
animation
vanished
as
quickly
as
it
appeared
he
was
always
well
and
even
elaborately
dressed
he
had
already
some
independent
fortune
and
expectations
of
much
more
he
was
a
friend
of
alyosha
s
in
an
ancient
jolting
but
roomy
hired
carriage
with
a
pair
of
old
pinkish
gray
horses
a
long
way
behind
mi
sov
s
carriage
came
fyodor
pavlovitch
with
his
son
ivan
dmitri
was
late
though
he
had
been
informed
of
the
time
the
evening
before
the
visitors
left
their
carriage
at
the
hotel
outside
the
precincts
and
went
to
the
gates
of
the
monastery
on
foot
except
fyodor
pavlovitch
none
of
the
party
had
ever
seen
the
monastery
and
mi
sov
had
probably
not
even
been
to
church
for
thirty
years
he
looked
about
him
with
curiosity
together
with
assumed
ease
but
except
the
church
and
the
domestic
buildings
though
these
too
were
ordinary
enough
he
found
nothing
of
interest
in
the
interior
of
the
monastery
the
last
of
the
worshippers
were
coming
out
of
the
church
bareheaded
and
crossing
themselves
among
the
humbler
people
were
a
few
of
higher
rank
two
or
three
ladies
and
a
very
old
general
they
were
all
staying
at
the
hotel
our
visitors
were
at
once
surrounded
by
beggars
but
none
of
them
gave
them
anything
except
young
kalganov
who
took
a
ten
copeck
piece
out
of
his
purse
and
nervous
and
embarrassed
god
knows
why
hurriedly
gave
it
to
an
old
woman
saying
divide
it
equally
none
of
his
companions
made
any
remark
upon
it
so
that
he
had
no
reason
to
be
embarrassed
but
perceiving
this
he
was
even
more
overcome
it
was
strange
that
their
arrival
did
not
seem
expected
and
that
they
were
not
received
with
special
honor
though
one
of
them
had
recently
made
a
donation
of
a
thousand
roubles
while
another
was
a
very
wealthy
and
highly
cultured
landowner
upon
whom
all
in
the
monastery
were
in
a
sense
dependent
as
a
decision
of
the
lawsuit
might
at
any
moment
put
their
fishing
rights
in
his
hands
yet
no
official
personage
met
them
mi
sov
looked
absent
mindedly
at
the
tombstones
round
the
church
and
was
on
the
point
of
saying
that
the
dead
buried
here
must
have
paid
a
pretty
penny
for
the
right
of
lying
in
this
holy
place
but
refrained
his
liberal
irony
was
rapidly
changing
almost
into
anger
who
the
devil
is
there
to
ask
in
this
imbecile
place
we
must
find
out
for
time
is
passing
he
observed
suddenly
as
though
speaking
to
himself
all
at
once
there
came
up
a
bald
headed
elderly
man
with
ingratiating
little
eyes
wearing
a
full
summer
overcoat
lifting
his
hat
he
introduced
himself
with
a
honeyed
lisp
as
maximov
a
landowner
of
tula
he
at
once
entered
into
our
visitors
difficulty
father
zossima
lives
in
the
hermitage
apart
four
hundred
paces
from
the
monastery
the
other
side
of
the
copse
i
know
it
s
the
other
side
of
the
copse
observed
fyodor
pavlovitch
but
we
don
t
remember
the
way
it
is
a
long
time
since
we
ve
been
here
this
way
by
this
gate
and
straight
across
the
copse
the
copse
come
with
me
won
t
you
i
ll
show
you
i
have
to
go
i
am
going
myself
this
way
this
way
they
came
out
of
the
gate
and
turned
towards
the
copse
maximov
a
man
of
sixty
ran
rather
than
walked
turning
sideways
to
stare
at
them
all
with
an
incredible
degree
of
nervous
curiosity
his
eyes
looked
starting
out
of
his
head
you
see
we
have
come
to
the
elder
upon
business
of
our
own
observed
mi
sov
severely
that
personage
has
granted
us
an
audience
so
to
speak
and
so
though
we
thank
you
for
showing
us
the
way
we
cannot
ask
you
to
accompany
us
i
ve
been
there
i
ve
been
already
un
chevalier
parfait
and
maximov
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
air
who
is
a
chevalier
asked
mi
sov
the
elder
the
splendid
elder
the
elder
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
monastery
zossima
such
an
elder
but
his
incoherent
talk
was
cut
short
by
a
very
pale
wan
looking
monk
of
medium
height
wearing
a
monk
s
cap
who
overtook
them
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
mi
sov
stopped
the
monk
with
an
extremely
courteous
profound
bow
announced
the
father
superior
invites
all
of
you
gentlemen
to
dine
with
him
after
your
visit
to
the
hermitage
at
one
o
clock
not
later
and
you
also
he
added
addressing
maximov
that
i
certainly
will
without
fail
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
hugely
delighted
at
the
invitation
and
believe
me
we
ve
all
given
our
word
to
behave
properly
here
and
you
pyotr
alexandrovitch
will
you
go
too
yes
of
course
what
have
i
come
for
but
to
study
all
the
customs
here
the
only
obstacle
to
me
is
your
company
yes
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
non
existent
as
yet
it
would
be
a
capital
thing
if
he
didn
t
turn
up
do
you
suppose
i
like
all
this
business
and
in
your
company
too
so
we
will
come
to
dinner
thank
the
father
superior
he
said
to
the
monk
no
it
is
my
duty
now
to
conduct
you
to
the
elder
answered
the
monk
if
so
i
ll
go
straight
to
the
father
superior
to
the
father
superior
babbled
maximov
the
father
superior
is
engaged
just
now
but
as
you
please
the
monk
hesitated
impertinent
old
man
mi
sov
observed
aloud
while
maximov
ran
back
to
the
monastery
he
s
like
von
sohn
fyodor
pavlovitch
said
suddenly
is
that
all
you
can
think
of
in
what
way
is
he
like
von
sohn
have
you
ever
seen
von
sohn
i
ve
seen
his
portrait
it
s
not
the
features
but
something
indefinable
he
s
a
second
von
sohn
i
can
always
tell
from
the
physiognomy
ah
i
dare
say
you
are
a
connoisseur
in
that
but
look
here
fyodor
pavlovitch
you
said
just
now
that
we
had
given
our
word
to
behave
properly
remember
it
i
advise
you
to
control
yourself
but
if
you
begin
to
play
the
fool
i
don
t
intend
to
be
associated
with
you
here
you
see
what
a
man
he
is
he
turned
to
the
monk
i
m
afraid
to
go
among
decent
people
with
him
a
fine
smile
not
without
a
certain
slyness
came
on
to
the
pale
bloodless
lips
of
the
monk
but
he
made
no
reply
and
was
evidently
silent
from
a
sense
of
his
own
dignity
mi
sov
frowned
more
than
ever
oh
devil
take
them
all
an
outer
show
elaborated
through
centuries
and
nothing
but
charlatanism
and
nonsense
underneath
flashed
through
mi
sov
s
mind
here
s
the
hermitage
we
ve
arrived
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
the
gates
are
shut
and
he
repeatedly
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
to
the
saints
painted
above
and
on
the
sides
of
the
gates
when
you
go
to
rome
you
must
do
as
the
romans
do
here
in
this
hermitage
there
are
twenty
five
saints
being
saved
they
look
at
one
another
and
eat
cabbages
and
not
one
woman
goes
in
at
this
gate
that
s
what
is
remarkable
and
that
really
is
so
but
i
did
hear
that
the
elder
receives
ladies
he
remarked
suddenly
to
the
monk
women
of
the
people
are
here
too
now
lying
in
the
portico
there
waiting
but
for
ladies
of
higher
rank
two
rooms
have
been
built
adjoining
the
portico
but
outside
the
precincts
you
can
see
the
windows
and
the
elder
goes
out
to
them
by
an
inner
passage
when
he
is
well
enough
they
are
always
outside
the
precincts
there
is
a
harkov
lady
madame
hohlakov
waiting
there
now
with
her
sick
daughter
probably
he
has
promised
to
come
out
to
her
though
of
late
he
has
been
so
weak
that
he
has
hardly
shown
himself
even
to
the
people
so
then
there
are
loopholes
after
all
to
creep
out
of
the
hermitage
to
the
ladies
don
t
suppose
holy
father
that
i
mean
any
harm
but
do
you
know
that
at
athos
not
only
the
visits
of
women
are
not
allowed
but
no
creature
of
the
female
sex
no
hens
nor
turkey
hens
nor
cows
fyodor
pavlovitch
i
warn
you
i
shall
go
back
and
leave
you
here
they
ll
turn
you
out
when
i
m
gone
but
i
m
not
interfering
with
you
pyotr
alexandrovitch
look
he
cried
suddenly
stepping
within
the
precincts
what
a
vale
of
roses
they
live
in
though
there
were
no
roses
now
there
were
numbers
of
rare
and
beautiful
autumn
flowers
growing
wherever
there
was
space
for
them
and
evidently
tended
by
a
skillful
hand
there
were
flower
beds
round
the
church
and
between
the
tombs
and
the
one
storied
wooden
house
where
the
elder
lived
was
also
surrounded
with
flowers
and
was
it
like
this
in
the
time
of
the
last
elder
varsonofy
he
didn
t
care
for
such
elegance
they
say
he
used
to
jump
up
and
thrash
even
ladies
with
a
stick
observed
fyodor
pavlovitch
as
he
went
up
the
steps
the
elder
varsonofy
did
sometimes
seem
rather
strange
but
a
great
deal
that
s
told
is
foolishness
he
never
thrashed
any
one
answered
the
monk
now
gentlemen
if
you
will
wait
a
minute
i
will
announce
you
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
the
last
time
your
compact
do
you
hear
behave
properly
or
i
will
pay
you
out
mi
sov
had
time
to
mutter
again
i
can
t
think
why
you
are
so
agitated
fyodor
pavlovitch
observed
sarcastically
are
you
uneasy
about
your
sins
they
say
he
can
tell
by
one
s
eyes
what
one
has
come
about
and
what
a
lot
you
think
of
their
opinion
you
a
parisian
and
so
advanced
i
m
surprised
at
you
but
mi
sov
had
no
time
to
reply
to
this
sarcasm
they
were
asked
to
come
in
he
walked
in
somewhat
irritated
now
i
know
myself
i
am
annoyed
i
shall
lose
my
temper
and
begin
to
quarrel
and
lower
myself
and
my
ideas
he
reflected
chapter
ii
the
old
buffoon
they
entered
the
room
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
the
elder
came
in
from
his
bedroom
there
were
already
in
the
cell
awaiting
the
elder
two
monks
of
the
hermitage
one
the
father
librarian
and
the
other
father
pa
ssy
a
very
learned
man
so
they
said
in
delicate
health
though
not
old
there
was
also
a
tall
young
man
who
looked
about
two
and
twenty
standing
in
the
corner
throughout
the
interview
he
had
a
broad
fresh
face
and
clever
observant
narrow
brown
eyes
and
was
wearing
ordinary
dress
he
was
a
divinity
student
living
under
the
protection
of
the
monastery
his
expression
was
one
of
unquestioning
but
self
respecting
reverence
being
in
a
subordinate
and
dependent
position
and
so
not
on
an
equality
with
the
guests
he
did
not
greet
them
with
a
bow
father
zossima
was
accompanied
by
a
novice
and
by
alyosha
the
two
monks
rose
and
greeted
him
with
a
very
deep
bow
touching
the
ground
with
their
fingers
then
kissed
his
hand
blessing
them
the
elder
replied
with
as
deep
a
reverence
to
them
and
asked
their
blessing
the
whole
ceremony
was
performed
very
seriously
and
with
an
appearance
of
feeling
not
like
an
everyday
rite
but
mi
sov
fancied
that
it
was
all
done
with
intentional
impressiveness
he
stood
in
front
of
the
other
visitors
he
ought
he
had
reflected
upon
it
the
evening
before
from
simple
politeness
since
it
was
the
custom
here
to
have
gone
up
to
receive
the
elder
s
blessing
even
if
he
did
not
kiss
his
hand
but
when
he
saw
all
this
bowing
and
kissing
on
the
part
of
the
monks
he
instantly
changed
his
mind
with
dignified
gravity
he
made
a
rather
deep
conventional
bow
and
moved
away
to
a
chair
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
the
same
mimicking
mi
sov
like
an
ape
ivan
bowed
with
great
dignity
and
courtesy
but
he
too
kept
his
hands
at
his
sides
while
kalganov
was
so
confused
that
he
did
not
bow
at
all
the
elder
let
fall
the
hand
raised
to
bless
them
and
bowing
to
them
again
asked
them
all
to
sit
down
the
blood
rushed
to
alyosha
s
cheeks
he
was
ashamed
his
forebodings
were
coming
true
father
zossima
sat
down
on
a
very
old
fashioned
mahogany
sofa
covered
with
leather
and
made
his
visitors
sit
down
in
a
row
along
the
opposite
wall
on
four
mahogany
chairs
covered
with
shabby
black
leather
the
monks
sat
one
at
the
door
and
the
other
at
the
window
the
divinity
student
the
novice
and
alyosha
remained
standing
the
cell
was
not
very
large
and
had
a
faded
look
it
contained
nothing
but
the
most
necessary
furniture
of
coarse
and
poor
quality
there
were
two
pots
of
flowers
in
the
window
and
a
number
of
holy
pictures
in
the
corner
before
one
huge
ancient
ikon
of
the
virgin
a
lamp
was
burning
near
it
were
two
other
holy
pictures
in
shining
settings
and
next
them
carved
cherubims
china
eggs
a
catholic
cross
of
ivory
with
a
mater
dolorosa
embracing
it
and
several
foreign
engravings
from
the
great
italian
artists
of
past
centuries
next
to
these
costly
and
artistic
engravings
were
several
of
the
roughest
russian
prints
of
saints
and
martyrs
such
as
are
sold
for
a
few
farthings
at
all
the
fairs
on
the
other
walls
were
portraits
of
russian
bishops
past
and
present
mi
sov
took
a
cursory
glance
at
all
these
conventional
surroundings
and
bent
an
intent
look
upon
the
elder
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
his
own
insight
a
weakness
excusable
in
him
as
he
was
fifty
an
age
at
which
a
clever
man
of
the
world
of
established
position
can
hardly
help
taking
himself
rather
seriously
at
the
first
moment
he
did
not
like
zossima
there
was
indeed
something
in
the
elder
s
face
which
many
people
besides
mi
sov
might
not
have
liked
he
was
a
short
bent
little
man
with
very
weak
legs
and
though
he
was
only
sixty
five
he
looked
at
least
ten
years
older
his
face
was
very
thin
and
covered
with
a
network
of
fine
wrinkles
particularly
numerous
about
his
eyes
which
were
small
light
colored
quick
and
shining
like
two
bright
points
he
had
a
sprinkling
of
gray
hair
about
his
temples
his
pointed
beard
was
small
and
scanty
and
his
lips
which
smiled
frequently
were
as
thin
as
two
threads
his
nose
was
not
long
but
sharp
like
a
bird
s
beak
to
all
appearances
a
malicious
soul
full
of
petty
pride
thought
mi
sov
he
felt
altogether
dissatisfied
with
his
position
a
cheap
little
clock
on
the
wall
struck
twelve
hurriedly
and
served
to
begin
the
conversation
precisely
to
our
time
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
but
no
sign
of
my
son
dmitri
i
apologize
for
him
sacred
elder
alyosha
shuddered
all
over
at
sacred
elder
i
am
always
punctual
myself
minute
for
minute
remembering
that
punctuality
is
the
courtesy
of
kings
but
you
are
not
a
king
anyway
mi
sov
muttered
losing
his
self
restraint
at
once
yes
that
s
true
i
m
not
a
king
and
would
you
believe
it
pyotr
alexandrovitch
i
was
aware
of
that
myself
but
there
i
always
say
the
wrong
thing
your
reverence
he
cried
with
sudden
pathos
you
behold
before
you
a
buffoon
in
earnest
i
introduce
myself
as
such
it
s
an
old
habit
alas
and
if
i
sometimes
talk
nonsense
out
of
place
it
s
with
an
object
with
the
object
of
amusing
people
and
making
myself
agreeable
one
must
be
agreeable
mustn
t
one
i
was
seven
years
ago
in
a
little
town
where
i
had
business
and
i
made
friends
with
some
merchants
there
we
went
to
the
captain
of
police
because
we
had
to
see
him
about
something
and
to
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
he
was
a
tall
fat
fair
sulky
man
the
most
dangerous
type
in
such
cases
it
s
their
liver
i
went
straight
up
to
him
and
with
the
ease
of
a
man
of
the
world
you
know
mr
ispravnik
said
i
be
our
napravnik
what
do
you
mean
by
napravnik
said
he
i
saw
at
the
first
half
second
that
it
had
missed
fire
he
stood
there
so
glum
i
wanted
to
make
a
joke
said
i
for
the
general
diversion
as
mr
napravnik
is
our
well
known
russian
orchestra
conductor
and
what
we
need
for
the
harmony
of
our
undertaking
is
some
one
of
that
sort
and
i
explained
my
comparison
very
reasonably
didn
t
i
excuse
me
said
he
i
am
an
ispravnik
and
i
do
not
allow
puns
to
be
made
on
my
calling
he
turned
and
walked
away
i
followed
him
shouting
yes
yes
you
are
an
ispravnik
not
a
napravnik
no
he
said
since
you
called
me
a
napravnik
i
am
one
and
would
you
believe
it
it
ruined
our
business
and
i
m
always
like
that
always
like
that
always
injuring
myself
with
my
politeness
once
many
years
ago
i
said
to
an
influential
person
your
wife
is
a
ticklish
lady
in
an
honorable
sense
of
the
moral
qualities
so
to
speak
but
he
asked
me
why
have
you
tickled
her
i
thought
i
d
be
polite
so
i
couldn
t
help
saying
yes
and
he
gave
me
a
fine
tickling
on
the
spot
only
that
happened
long
ago
so
i
m
not
ashamed
to
tell
the
story
i
m
always
injuring
myself
like
that
you
re
doing
it
now
muttered
mi
sov
with
disgust
father
zossima
scrutinized
them
both
in
silence
am
i
would
you
believe
it
i
was
aware
of
that
too
pyotr
alexandrovitch
and
let
me
tell
you
indeed
i
foresaw
i
should
as
soon
as
i
began
to
speak
and
do
you
know
i
foresaw
too
that
you
d
be
the
first
to
remark
on
it
the
minute
i
see
my
joke
isn
t
coming
off
your
reverence
both
my
cheeks
feel
as
though
they
were
drawn
down
to
the
lower
jaw
and
there
is
almost
a
spasm
in
them
that
s
been
so
since
i
was
young
when
i
had
to
make
jokes
for
my
living
in
noblemen
s
families
i
am
an
inveterate
buffoon
and
have
been
from
birth
up
your
reverence
it
s
as
though
it
were
a
craze
in
me
i
dare
say
it
s
a
devil
within
me
but
only
a
little
one
a
more
serious
one
would
have
chosen
another
lodging
but
not
your
soul
pyotr
alexandrovitch
you
re
not
a
lodging
worth
having
either
but
i
do
believe
i
believe
in
god
though
i
have
had
doubts
of
late
but
now
i
sit
and
await
words
of
wisdom
i
m
like
the
philosopher
diderot
your
reverence
did
you
ever
hear
most
holy
father
how
diderot
went
to
see
the
metropolitan
platon
in
the
time
of
the
empress
catherine
he
went
in
and
said
straight
out
there
is
no
god
to
which
the
great
bishop
lifted
up
his
finger
and
answered
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
and
he
fell
down
at
his
feet
on
the
spot
i
believe
he
cried
and
will
be
christened
and
so
he
was
princess
dashkov
was
his
godmother
and
potyomkin
his
godfather
fyodor
pavlovitch
this
is
unbearable
you
know
you
re
telling
lies
and
that
that
stupid
anecdote
isn
t
true
why
are
you
playing
the
fool
cried
mi
sov
in
a
shaking
voice
i
suspected
all
my
life
that
it
wasn
t
true
fyodor
pavlovitch
cried
with
conviction
but
i
ll
tell
you
the
whole
truth
gentlemen
great
elder
forgive
me
the
last
thing
about
diderot
s
christening
i
made
up
just
now
i
never
thought
of
it
before
i
made
it
up
to
add
piquancy
i
play
the
fool
pyotr
alexandrovitch
to
make
myself
agreeable
though
i
really
don
t
know
myself
sometimes
what
i
do
it
for
and
as
for
diderot
i
heard
as
far
as
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
twenty
times
from
the
gentry
about
here
when
i
was
young
i
heard
your
aunt
pyotr
alexandrovitch
tell
the
story
they
all
believe
to
this
day
that
the
infidel
diderot
came
to
dispute
about
god
with
the
metropolitan
platon
mi
sov
got
up
forgetting
himself
in
his
impatience
he
was
furious
and
conscious
of
being
ridiculous
what
was
taking
place
in
the
cell
was
really
incredible
for
forty
or
fifty
years
past
from
the
times
of
former
elders
no
visitors
had
entered
that
cell
without
feelings
of
the
profoundest
veneration
almost
every
one
admitted
to
the
cell
felt
that
a
great
favor
was
being
shown
him
many
remained
kneeling
during
the
whole
visit
of
those
visitors
many
had
been
men
of
high
rank
and
learning
some
even
freethinkers
attracted
by
curiosity
but
all
without
exception
had
shown
the
profoundest
reverence
and
delicacy
for
here
there
was
no
question
of
money
but
only
on
the
one
side
love
and
kindness
and
on
the
other
penitence
and
eager
desire
to
decide
some
spiritual
problem
or
crisis
so
that
such
buffoonery
amazed
and
bewildered
the
spectators
or
at
least
some
of
them
the
monks
with
unchanged
countenances
waited
with
earnest
attention
to
hear
what
the
elder
would
say
but
seemed
on
the
point
of
standing
up
like
mi
sov
alyosha
stood
with
hanging
head
on
the
verge
of
tears
what
seemed
to
him
strangest
of
all
was
that
his
brother
ivan
on
whom
alone
he
had
rested
his
hopes
and
who
alone
had
such
influence
on
his
father
that
he
could
have
stopped
him
sat
now
quite
unmoved
with
downcast
eyes
apparently
waiting
with
interest
to
see
how
it
would
end
as
though
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
alyosha
did
not
dare
to
look
at
rakitin
the
divinity
student
whom
he
knew
almost
intimately
he
alone
in
the
monastery
knew
rakitin
s
thoughts
forgive
me
began
mi
sov
addressing
father
zossima
for
perhaps
i
seem
to
be
taking
part
in
this
shameful
foolery
i
made
a
mistake
in
believing
that
even
a
man
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
would
understand
what
was
due
on
a
visit
to
so
honored
a
personage
i
did
not
suppose
i
should
have
to
apologize
simply
for
having
come
with
him
pyotr
alexandrovitch
could
say
no
more
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
overwhelmed
with
confusion
don
t
distress
yourself
i
beg
the
elder
got
on
to
his
feeble
legs
and
taking
pyotr
alexandrovitch
by
both
hands
made
him
sit
down
again
i
beg
you
not
to
disturb
yourself
i
particularly
beg
you
to
be
my
guest
and
with
a
bow
he
went
back
and
sat
down
again
on
his
little
sofa
great
elder
speak
do
i
annoy
you
by
my
vivacity
fyodor
pavlovitch
cried
suddenly
clutching
the
arms
of
his
chair
in
both
hands
as
though
ready
to
leap
up
from
it
if
the
answer
were
unfavorable
i
earnestly
beg
you
too
not
to
disturb
yourself
and
not
to
be
uneasy
the
elder
said
impressively
do
not
trouble
make
yourself
quite
at
home
and
above
all
do
not
be
so
ashamed
of
yourself
for
that
is
at
the
root
of
it
all
quite
at
home
to
be
my
natural
self
oh
that
is
much
too
much
but
i
accept
it
with
grateful
joy
do
you
know
blessed
father
you
d
better
not
invite
me
to
be
my
natural
self
don
t
risk
it
i
will
not
go
so
far
as
that
myself
i
warn
you
for
your
own
sake
well
the
rest
is
still
plunged
in
the
mists
of
uncertainty
though
there
are
people
who
d
be
pleased
to
describe
me
for
you
i
mean
that
for
you
pyotr
alexandrovitch
but
as
for
you
holy
being
let
me
tell
you
i
am
brimming
over
with
ecstasy
he
got
up
and
throwing
up
his
hands
declaimed
blessed
be
the
womb
that
bare
thee
and
the
paps
that
gave
thee
suck
the
paps
especially
when
you
said
just
now
don
t
be
so
ashamed
of
yourself
for
that
is
at
the
root
of
it
all
you
pierced
right
through
me
by
that
remark
and
read
me
to
the
core
indeed
i
always
feel
when
i
meet
people
that
i
am
lower
than
all
and
that
they
all
take
me
for
a
buffoon
so
i
say
let
me
really
play
the
buffoon
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
opinion
for
you
are
every
one
of
you
worse
than
i
am
that
is
why
i
am
a
buffoon
it
is
from
shame
great
elder
from
shame
it
s
simply
over
sensitiveness
that
makes
me
rowdy
if
i
had
only
been
sure
that
every
one
would
accept
me
as
the
kindest
and
wisest
of
men
oh
lord
what
a
good
man
i
should
have
been
then
teacher
he
fell
suddenly
on
his
knees
what
must
i
do
to
gain
eternal
life
it
was
difficult
even
now
to
decide
whether
he
was
joking
or
really
moved
father
zossima
lifting
his
eyes
looked
at
him
and
said
with
a
smile
you
have
known
for
a
long
time
what
you
must
do
you
have
sense
enough
don
t
give
way
to
drunkenness
and
incontinence
of
speech
don
t
give
way
to
sensual
lust
and
above
all
to
the
love
of
money
and
close
your
taverns
if
you
can
t
close
all
at
least
two
or
three
and
above
all
don
t
lie
you
mean
about
diderot
no
not
about
diderot
above
all
don
t
lie
to
yourself
the
man
who
lies
to
himself
and
listens
to
his
own
lie
comes
to
such
a
pass
that
he
cannot
distinguish
the
truth
within
him
or
around
him
and
so
loses
all
respect
for
himself
and
for
others
and
having
no
respect
he
ceases
to
love
and
in
order
to
occupy
and
distract
himself
without
love
he
gives
way
to
passions
and
coarse
pleasures
and
sinks
to
bestiality
in
his
vices
all
from
continual
lying
to
other
men
and
to
himself
the
man
who
lies
to
himself
can
be
more
easily
offended
than
any
one
you
know
it
is
sometimes
very
pleasant
to
take
offense
isn
t
it
a
man
may
know
that
nobody
has
insulted
him
but
that
he
has
invented
the
insult
for
himself
has
lied
and
exaggerated
to
make
it
picturesque
has
caught
at
a
word
and
made
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
he
knows
that
himself
yet
he
will
be
the
first
to
take
offense
and
will
revel
in
his
resentment
till
he
feels
great
pleasure
in
it
and
so
pass
to
genuine
vindictiveness
but
get
up
sit
down
i
beg
you
all
this
too
is
deceitful
posturing
blessed
man
give
me
your
hand
to
kiss
fyodor
pavlovitch
skipped
up
and
imprinted
a
rapid
kiss
on
the
elder
s
thin
hand
it
is
it
is
pleasant
to
take
offense
you
said
that
so
well
as
i
never
heard
it
before
yes
i
have
been
all
my
life
taking
offense
to
please
myself
taking
offense
on
esthetic
grounds
for
it
is
not
so
much
pleasant
as
distinguished
sometimes
to
be
insulted
that
you
had
forgotten
great
elder
it
is
distinguished
i
shall
make
a
note
of
that
but
i
have
been
lying
lying
positively
my
whole
life
long
every
day
and
hour
of
it
of
a
truth
i
am
a
lie
and
the
father
of
lies
though
i
believe
i
am
not
the
father
of
lies
i
am
getting
mixed
in
my
texts
say
the
son
of
lies
and
that
will
be
enough
only
my
angel
i
may
sometimes
talk
about
diderot
diderot
will
do
no
harm
though
sometimes
a
word
will
do
harm
great
elder
by
the
way
i
was
forgetting
though
i
had
been
meaning
for
the
last
two
years
to
come
here
on
purpose
to
ask
and
to
find
out
something
only
do
tell
pyotr
alexandrovitch
not
to
interrupt
me
here
is
my
question
is
it
true
great
father
that
the
story
is
told
somewhere
in
the
lives
of
the
saints
of
a
holy
saint
martyred
for
his
faith
who
when
his
head
was
cut
off
at
last
stood
up
picked
up
his
head
and
courteously
kissing
it
walked
a
long
way
carrying
it
in
his
hands
is
that
true
or
not
honored
father
no
it
is
untrue
said
the
elder
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
in
all
the
lives
of
the
saints
what
saint
do
you
say
the
story
is
told
of
asked
the
father
librarian
i
do
not
know
what
saint
i
do
not
know
and
can
t
tell
i
was
deceived
i
was
told
the
story
i
had
heard
it
and
do
you
know
who
told
it
pyotr
alexandrovitch
mi
sov
here
who
was
so
angry
just
now
about
diderot
he
it
was
who
told
the
story
i
have
never
told
it
you
i
never
speak
to
you
at
all
it
is
true
you
did
not
tell
me
but
you
told
it
when
i
was
present
it
was
three
years
ago
i
mentioned
it
because
by
that
ridiculous
story
you
shook
my
faith
pyotr
alexandrovitch
you
knew
nothing
of
it
but
i
went
home
with
my
faith
shaken
and
i
have
been
getting
more
and
more
shaken
ever
since
yes
pyotr
alexandrovitch
you
were
the
cause
of
a
great
fall
that
was
not
a
diderot
fyodor
pavlovitch
got
excited
and
pathetic
though
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
every
one
by
now
that
he
was
playing
a
part
again
yet
mi
sov
was
stung
by
his
words
what
nonsense
and
it
is
all
nonsense
he
muttered
i
may
really
have
told
it
some
time
or
other
but
not
to
you
i
was
told
it
myself
i
heard
it
in
paris
from
a
frenchman
he
told
me
it
was
read
at
our
mass
from
the
lives
of
the
saints
he
was
a
very
learned
man
who
had
made
a
special
study
of
russian
statistics
and
had
lived
a
long
time
in
russia
i
have
not
read
the
lives
of
the
saints
myself
and
i
am
not
going
to
read
them
all
sorts
of
things
are
said
at
dinner
we
were
dining
then
yes
you
were
dining
then
and
so
i
lost
my
faith
said
fyodor
pavlovitch
mimicking
him
what
do
i
care
for
your
faith
mi
sov
was
on
the
point
of
shouting
but
he
suddenly
checked
himself
and
said
with
contempt
you
defile
everything
you
touch
the
elder
suddenly
rose
from
his
seat
excuse
me
gentlemen
for
leaving
you
a
few
minutes
he
said
addressing
all
his
guests
i
have
visitors
awaiting
me
who
arrived
before
you
but
don
t
you
tell
lies
all
the
same
he
added
turning
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
with
a

him
down

steps
alyosha
was
breathless

glad

going
towards

portico

chapter
iii
peasant
women
who
have
faith
near
the
wooden
portico
below
built
on
to
the
outer
wall
of
the
precinct
there
was
a
crowd
of
about
twenty
peasant
women
they
had
been
told
that
the
elder
was
at
last
coming
out
and
they
had
gathered
together
in
anticipation
two
ladies
madame
hohlakov
and
her
daughter
had
also
come
out
into
the
portico
to
wait
for
the
elder
but
in
a
separate
part
of
it
set
aside
for
women
of
rank
madame
hohlakov
was
a
wealthy
lady
still
young
and
attractive
and
always
dressed
with
taste
she
was
rather
pale
and
had
lively
black
eyes
she
was
not
more
than
thirty
three
and
had
been
five
years
a
widow
her
daughter
a
girl
of
fourteen
was
partially
paralyzed
the
poor
child
had
not
been
able
to
walk
for
the
last
six
months
and
was
wheeled
about
in
a
long
reclining
chair
she
had
a
charming
little
face
rather
thin
from
illness
but
full
of
gayety
there
was
a
gleam
of
mischief
in
her
big
dark
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
her
mother
had
been
intending
to
take
her
abroad
ever
since
the
spring
but
they
had
been
detained
all
the
summer
by
business
connected
with
their
estate
they
had
been
staying
a
week
in
our
town
where
they
had
come
more
for
purposes
of
business
than
devotion
but
had
visited
father
zossima
once
already
three
days
before
though
they
knew
that
the
elder
scarcely
saw
any
one
they
had
now
suddenly
turned
up
again
and
urgently
entreated
the
happiness
of
looking
once
again
on
the
great
healer
the
mother
was
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
side
of
her
daughter
s
invalid
carriage
and
two
paces
from
her
stood
an
old
monk
not
one
of
our
monastery
but
a
visitor
from
an
obscure
religious
house
in
the
far
north
he
too
sought
the
elder
s
blessing
but
father
zossima
on
entering
the
portico
went
first
straight
to
the
peasants
who
were
crowded
at
the
foot
of
the
three
steps
that
led
up
into
the
portico
father
zossima
stood
on
the
top
step
put
on
his
stole
and
began
blessing
the
women
who
thronged
about
him
one
crazy
woman
was
led
up
to
him
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
elder
she
began
shrieking
and
writhing
as
though
in
the
pains
of
childbirth
laying
the
stole
on
her
forehead
he
read
a
short
prayer
over
her
and
she
was
at
once
soothed
and
quieted
i
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
now
but
in
my
childhood
i
often
happened
to
see
and
hear
these
possessed
women
in
the
villages
and
monasteries
they
used
to
be
brought
to
mass
they
would
squeal
and
bark
like
a
dog
so
that
they
were
heard
all
over
the
church
but
when
the
sacrament
was
carried
in
and
they
were
led
up
to
it
at
once
the
possession
ceased
and
the
sick
women
were
always
soothed
for
a
time
i
was
greatly
impressed
and
amazed
at
this
as
a
child
but
then
i
heard
from
country
neighbors
and
from
my
town
teachers
that
the
whole
illness
was
simulated
to
avoid
work
and
that
it
could
always
be
cured
by
suitable
severity
various
anecdotes
were
told
to
confirm
this
but
later
on
i
learnt
with
astonishment
from
medical
specialists
that
there
is
no
pretense
about
it
that
it
is
a
terrible
illness
to
which
women
are
subject
specially
prevalent
among
us
in
russia
and
that
it
is
due
to
the
hard
lot
of
the
peasant
women
it
is
a
disease
i
was
told
arising
from
exhausting
toil
too
soon
after
hard
abnormal
and
unassisted
labor
in
childbirth
and
from
the
hopeless
misery
from
beatings
and
so
on
which
some
women
were
not
able
to
endure
like
others
the
strange
and
instant
healing
of
the
frantic
and
struggling
woman
as
soon
as
she
was
led
up
to
the
holy
sacrament
which
had
been
explained
to
me
as
due
to
malingering
and
the
trickery
of
the
clericals
arose
probably
in
the
most
natural
manner
both
the
women
who
supported
her
and
the
invalid
herself
fully
believed
as
a
truth
beyond
question
that
the
evil
spirit
in
possession
of
her
could
not
hold
out
if
the
sick
woman
were
brought
to
the
sacrament
and
made
to
bow
down
before
it
and
so
with
a
nervous
and
psychically
deranged
woman
a
sort
of
convulsion
of
the
whole
organism
always
took
place
and
was
bound
to
take
place
at
the
moment
of
bowing
down
to
the
sacrament
aroused
by
the
expectation
of
the
miracle
of
healing
and
the
implicit
belief
that
it
would
come
to
pass
and
it
did
come
to
pass
though
only
for
a
moment
it
was
exactly
the
same
now
as
soon
as
the
elder
touched
the
sick
woman
with
the
stole
many
of
the
women
in
the
crowd
were
moved
to
tears
of
ecstasy
by
the
effect
of
the
moment
some
strove
to
kiss
the
hem
of
his
garment
others
cried
out
in
sing
song
voices
he
blessed
them
all
and
talked
with
some
of
them
the
possessed
woman
he
knew
already
she
came
from
a
village
only
six
versts
from
the
monastery
and
had
been
brought
to
him
before
but
here
is
one
from
afar
he
pointed
to
a
woman
by
no
means
old
but
very
thin
and
wasted
with
a
face
not
merely
sunburnt
but
almost
blackened
by
exposure
she
was
kneeling
and
gazing
with
a
fixed
stare
at
the
elder
there
was
something
almost
frenzied
in
her
eyes
from
afar
off
father
from
afar
off
from
two
hundred
miles
from
here
from
afar
off
father
from
afar
off
the
woman
began
in
a
sing
song
voice
as
though
she
were
chanting
a
dirge
swaying
her
head
from
side
to
side
with
her
cheek
resting
in
her
hand
there
is
silent
and
long
suffering
sorrow
to
be
met
with
among
the
peasantry
it
withdraws
into
itself
and
is
still
but
there
is
a
grief
that
breaks
out
and
from
that
minute
it
bursts
into
tears
and
finds
vent
in
wailing
this
is
particularly
common
with
women
but
it
is
no
lighter
a
grief
than
the
silent
lamentations
comfort
only
by
lacerating
the
heart
still
more
such
grief
does
not
desire
consolation
it
feeds
on
the
sense
of
its
hopelessness
lamentations
spring
only
from
the
constant
craving
to
reopen
the
wound
you
are
of
the
tradesman
class
said
father
zossima
looking
curiously
at
her
townfolk

are

mother
said
the
elder
once
in
olden
times
a
holy
saint
saw
in
the
temple
a
mother
like
you
weeping
for
her
little
one
her
only
one
whom
god
had
taken
knowest
thou
not
said
the
saint
to
her
how
bold
these
little
ones
are
before
the
throne
of
god
verily
there
are
none
bolder
than
they
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
thou
didst
give
us
life
o
lord
they
say
and
scarcely
had
we
looked
upon
it
when
thou
didst
take
it
back
again
and
so
boldly
they
ask
and
ask
again
that
god
gives
them
at
once
the
rank
of
angels
therefore
said
the
saint
thou
too
o
mother
rejoice
and
weep
not
for
thy
little
son
is
with
the
lord
in
the
fellowship
of
the
angels
that
s
what
the
saint
said
to
the
weeping
mother
of
old
he
was
a
great
saint
and
he
could
not
have
spoken
falsely
therefore
you
too
mother
know
that
your
little
one
is
surely
before
the
throne
of
god
is
rejoicing
and
happy
and
praying
to
god
for
you
and
therefore
weep
not
but
rejoice
the
woman
listened
to
him
looking
down
with
her
cheek
in
her
hand
she
sighed
deeply
my
nikita
tried
to
comfort
me
with
the
same
words
as
you
foolish
one
he
said
why
weep
our
son
is
no
doubt
singing
with
the
angels
before
god
he
says
that
to
me
but
he
weeps
himself
i
see
that
he
cries
like
me
i
know
nikita
said
i
where
could
he
be
if
not
with
the
lord
god
only
here
with
us
now
he
is
not
as
he
used
to
sit
beside
us
before
and
if
only
i
could
look
upon
him
one
little
time
if
only
i
could
peep
at
him
one
little
time
without
going
up
to
him
without
speaking
if
i
could
be
hidden
in
a
corner
and
only
see
him
for
one
little
minute
hear
him
playing
in
the
yard
calling
in
his
little
voice
mammy
where
are
you
if
only
i
could
hear
him
pattering
with
his
little
feet
about
the
room
just
once
only
once
for
so
often
so
often
i
remember
how
he
used
to
run
to
me
and
shout
and
laugh
if
only
i
could
hear
his
little
feet
i
should
know
him
but
he
s
gone
father
he
s
gone
and
i
shall
never
hear
him
again
here
s
his
little
sash
but
him
i
shall
never
see
or
hear
now
she
drew
out
of
her
bosom
her
boy
s
little
embroidered
sash
and
as
soon
as
she
looked
at
it
she
began
shaking
with
sobs
hiding
her
eyes
with
her
fingers
through
which
the
tears
flowed
in
a
sudden
stream
it
is
rachel
of
old
said
the
elder
weeping
for
her
children
and
will
not
be
comforted
because
they
are
not
such
is
the
lot
set
on
earth
for
you
mothers
be
not
comforted
consolation
is
not
what
you
need
weep
and
be
not
consoled
but
weep
only
every
time
that
you
weep
be
sure
to
remember
that
your
little
son
is
one
of
the
angels
of
god
that
he
looks
down
from
there
at
you
and
sees
you
and
rejoices
at
your
tears
and
points
at
them
to
the
lord
god
and
a
long
while
yet
will
you
keep
that
great
mother
s
grief
but
it
will
turn
in
the
end
into
quiet
joy
and
your
bitter
tears
will
be
only
tears
of
tender
sorrow
that
purifies
the
heart
and
delivers
it
from
sin
and
i
shall
pray
for
the
peace
of
your
child
s
soul
what
was
his
name
alexey
father
a
sweet
name
after
alexey
the
man
of
god
yes
father
what
a
saint
he
was
i
will
remember
him
mother
and
your
grief
in
my
prayers
and
i
will
pray
for
your
husband
s
health
it
is
a
sin
for
you
to
leave
him
your
little
one
will
see
from
heaven
that
you
have
forsaken
his
father
and
will
weep
over
you
why
do
you
trouble
his
happiness
he
is
living
for
the
soul
lives
for
ever
and
though
he
is
not
in
the
house
he
is
near
you
unseen
how
can
he
go
into
the
house
when
you
say
that
the
house
is
hateful
to
you
to
whom
is
he
to
go
if
he
find
you
not
together
his
father
and
mother
he
comes
to
you
in
dreams
now
and
you
grieve
but
then
he
will
send
you
gentle
dreams

to
your
husband

very
day

your
word

will
go

gone
straight
to
my
heart
my
nikita
my
nikita
you
are
waiting
for
me
the
woman
began
in
a
sing
song
voice
but
the
elder
had
already
turned
away
to
a
very
old
woman
dressed
like
a
dweller
in
the
town
not
like
a
pilgrim
her
eyes
showed
that
she
had
come
with
an
object
and
in
order
to
say
something
she
said
she
was
the
widow
of
a
non
commissioned
officer
and
lived
close
by
in
the
town
her
son
vasenka
was
in
the
commissariat
service
and
had
gone
to
irkutsk
in
siberia
he
had
written
twice
from
there
but
now
a
year
had
passed
since
he
had
written
she
did
inquire
about
him
but
she
did
not
know
the
proper
place
to
inquire
only
the
other
day
stepanida
ilyinishna
she
s
a
rich
merchant
s
wife
said
to
me
you
go
prohorovna
and
put
your
son
s
name
down
for
prayer
in
the
church
and
pray
for
the
peace
of
his
soul
as
though
he
were
dead
his
soul
will
be
troubled
she
said
and
he
will
write
you
a
letter
and
stepanida
ilyinishna
told
me
it
was
a
certain
thing
which
had
been
many
times
tried
only
i
am
in
doubt
oh
you
light
of
ours
is
it
true
or
false
and
would
it
be
right
don
t
think
of
it
it
s
shameful
to
ask
the
question
how
is
it
possible
to
pray
for
the
peace
of
a
living
soul
and
his
own
mother
too
it
s
a
great
sin
akin
to
sorcery
only
for
your
ignorance
it
is
forgiven
you
better
pray
to
the
queen
of
heaven

i
tell
you
dear
father
god

our
benefactor
who
prays
for
all
of
us
and
for
our
sins
but
the
elder
had
already
noticed
in
the
crowd
two
glowing
eyes
fixed
upon
him
an
exhausted
consumptive
looking
though
young
peasant
woman
was
gazing
at
him
in
silence
her
eyes
besought
him
but
she
seemed
afraid
to
approach
what
is
it
my
child
absolve
my
soul
father
she
articulated
softly
and
slowly
sank
on
her
knees
and
bowed
down
at
his
feet
i
have
sinned
father
i
am
afraid
of
my
sin
the
elder
sat
down
on
the
lower
step
the
woman
crept
closer
to
him
still
on
her
knees
i
am
a
widow
these
three
years
she
began
in
a
half
whisper
with
a
sort
of
shudder
i
had
a
hard
life
with
my
husband
he
was
an
old
man
he
used
to
beat
me
cruelly
he
lay
ill
i
thought
looking
at
him
if
he
were
to
get
well
if
he
were
to
get
up
again
what
then
and
then
the
thought
came
to
me
stay
said
the
elder
and
he
put
his
ear
close
to
her
lips
the
woman
went
on
in
a
low
whisper
so
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
catch
anything
she
had
soon
done
three
years
ago
asked
the
elder
three
years
at
first
i
didn
t
think
about
it
but
now
i
ve
begun
to
be
ill
and
the
thought
never
leaves
me
have
you
come
from
far
over
three
hundred
miles
away
have
you
told
it
in
confession
i
have
confessed
it
twice
i
have
confessed
it
have
you
been
admitted
to
communion
yes
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
to
die
fear
nothing
and
never
be
afraid
and
don
t
fret
if
only
your
penitence
fail
not
god
will
forgive
all
there
is
no
sin
and
there
can
be
no
sin
on
all
the
earth
which
the
lord
will
not
forgive
to
the
truly
repentant
man
cannot
commit
a
sin
so
great
as
to
exhaust
the
infinite
love
of
god
can
there
be
a
sin
which
could
exceed
the
love
of
god
think
only
of
repentance
continual
repentance
but
dismiss
fear
altogether
believe
that
god
loves
you
as
you
cannot
conceive
that
he
loves
you
with
your
sin
in
your
sin
it
has
been
said
of
old
that
over
one
repentant
sinner
there
is
more
joy
in
heaven
than
over
ten
righteous
men
go
and
fear
not
be
not
bitter
against
men
be
not
angry
if
you
are
wronged
forgive
the
dead
man
in
your
heart
what
wrong
he
did
you
be
reconciled
with
him
in
truth
if
you
are
penitent
you
love
and
if
you
love
you
are
of
god
all
things
are
atoned
for
all
things
are
saved
by
love
if
i
a
sinner
even
as
you
are
am
tender
with
you
and
have
pity
on
you
how
much
more
will
god
love
is
such
a
priceless
treasure
that
you
can
redeem
the
whole
world
by
it
and
expiate
not
only
your
own
sins
but
the
sins
of
others
he
signed
her
three
times
with
the
cross
took
from
his
own
neck
a
little
ikon
and
put
it
upon
her
she
bowed
down
to
the
earth
without
speaking
he
got
up
and
looked
cheerfully
at
a
healthy
peasant
woman
with
a
tiny
baby
in
her
arms
from

chapter
iv
a
lady
of
little
faith
a
visitor
looking
on
the
scene
of
his
conversation
with
the
peasants
and
his
blessing
them
shed
silent
tears
and
wiped
them
away
with
her
handkerchief
she
was
a
sentimental
society
lady
of
genuinely
good
disposition
in
many
respects
when
the
elder
went
up
to
her
at
last
she
met
him
enthusiastically
ah
what
i
have
been
feeling
looking
on
at
this
touching
scene
she
could
not
go
on
for
emotion
oh
i
understand
the
people
s
love
for
you
i
love
the
people
myself
i
want
to
love
them
and
who
could
help
loving
them
our
splendid
russian
people
so
simple
in
their
greatness
how
is
your
daughter
s
health
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
again
oh
i
have
been
urgently
begging
for
it
i
have
prayed
for
it
i
was
ready
to
fall
on
my
knees
and
kneel
for
three
days
at
your
windows
until
you
let
me
in
we
have
come
great
healer
to
express
our
ardent
gratitude
you
have
healed
my
lise
healed
her
completely
merely
by
praying
over
her
last
thursday
and
laying
your
hands
upon
her
we
have
hastened
here
to
kiss
those
hands
to
pour
out
our
feelings
and
our
homage
what
do
you
mean
by
healed
but
she
is
still
lying
down
in
her
chair
but
her
night
fevers
have
entirely
ceased
ever
since
thursday
said
the
lady
with
nervous
haste
and
that
s
not
all
her
legs
are
stronger
this
morning
she
got
up
well
she
had
slept
all
night
look
at
her
rosy
cheeks
her
bright
eyes
she
used
to
be
always
crying
but
now
she
laughs
and
is
gay
and
happy
this
morning
she
insisted
on
my
letting
her
stand
up
and
she
stood
up
for
a
whole
minute
without
any
support
she
wagers
that
in
a
fortnight
she
ll
be
dancing
a
quadrille
i
ve
called
in
doctor
herzenstube
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
i
am
amazed
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
and
would
you
have
us
not
come
here
to
disturb
you
not
fly
here
to
thank
you
lise
thank
him
thank
him
lise
s
pretty
little
laughing
face
became
suddenly
serious
she
rose
in
her
chair
as
far
as
she
could
and
looking
at
the
elder
clasped
her
hands
before
him
but
could
not
restrain
herself
and
broke
into
laughter
it
s
at
him
she
said
pointing
to
alyosha
with
childish
vexation
at
herself
for
not
being
able
to
repress
her
mirth
if
any
one
had
looked
at
alyosha
standing
a
step
behind
the
elder
he
would
have
caught
a
quick
flush
crimsoning
his
cheeks
in
an
instant
his
eyes
shone
and
he
looked
down
she
has
a
message
for
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
how
are
you
the
mother
went
on
holding
out
her
exquisitely
gloved
hand
to
alyosha
the
elder
turned
round
and
all
at
once
looked
attentively
at
alyosha
the
latter
went
nearer
to
lise
and
smiling
in
a
strangely
awkward
way
held
out
his
hand
to
her
too
lise
assumed
an
important
air
katerina
ivanovna
has
sent
you
this
through
me
she
handed
him
a
little
note
she
particularly
begs
you
to
go
and
see
her
as
soon
as
possible
that
you
will
not
fail
her
but
will
be
sure
to
come
she
asks
me
to
go
and
see
her
me
what
for
alyosha
muttered
in
great
astonishment
his
face
at
once
looked
anxious
oh
it
s
all
to
do
with
dmitri
fyodorovitch
and
what
has
happened
lately
the
mother
explained
hurriedly
katerina
ivanovna
has
made
up
her
mind
but
she
must
see
you
about
it
why
of
course
i
can
t
say
but
she
wants
to
see
you
at
once
and
you
will
go
to
her
of
course
it
is
a
christian
duty
i
have
only
seen
her
once
alyosha
protested
with
the
same
perplexity
oh
she
is
such
a
lofty
incomparable
creature
if
only
for
her
suffering
think
what
she
has
gone
through
what
she
is
enduring
now
think
what
awaits
her
it
s
all
terrible
terrible
very
well
i
will
come
alyosha
decided
after
rapidly
scanning
the
brief
enigmatic
note
which
consisted
of
an
urgent
entreaty
that
he
would
come
without
any
sort
of
explanation
oh
how
sweet
and
generous
that
would
be
of
you
cried
lise
with
sudden
animation
i
told
mamma
you
d
be
sure
not
to
go
i
said
you
were
saving
your
soul
how
splendid
you
are
i
ve
always
thought
you
were
splendid
how
glad
i
am
to
tell
you
so
lise
said
her
mother
impressively
though
she
smiled
after
she
had
said
it
you
have
quite
forgotten
us
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
said
you
never
come
to
see
us
yet
lise
has
told
me
twice
that
she
is
never
happy
except
with
you
alyosha
raised
his
downcast
eyes
and
again
flushed
and
again
smiled
without
knowing
why
but
the
elder
was
no
longer
watching
him
he
had
begun
talking
to
a
monk
who
as
mentioned
before
had
been
awaiting
his
entrance
by
lise
s
chair
he
was
evidently
a
monk
of
the
humblest
that
is
of
the
peasant
class
of
a
narrow
outlook
but
a
true
believer
and
in
his
own
way
a
stubborn
one
he
announced
that
he
had
come
from
the
far
north
from
obdorsk
from
saint
sylvester
and
was
a
member
of
a
poor
monastery
consisting
of
only
ten
monks
the
elder
gave
him
his
blessing
and
invited
him
to
come
to
his
cell
whenever
he
liked
how
can
you
presume
to
do
such
deeds
the
monk
asked
suddenly
pointing
solemnly
and
significantly
at
lise
he
was
referring
to
her
healing
it
s
too
early
of
course
to
speak
of
that
relief
is
not
complete
cure
and
may
proceed
from
different
causes
but
if
there
has
been
any
healing
it
is
by
no
power
but
god
s
will
it
s
all
from
god
visit
me
father
he
added
to
the
monk
it
s
not
often
i
can
see
visitors
i
am
ill
and
i
know
that
my
days
are
numbered
oh
no
no
god
will
not
take
you
from
us
you
will
live
a
long
long
time
yet
cried
the
lady
and
in
what
way
are
you
ill
you
look
so
well
so
gay
and
happy
i
am
extraordinarily
better
to
day
but
i
know
that
it
s
only
for
a
moment
i
understand
my
disease
now
thoroughly
if
i
seem
so
happy
to
you
you
could
never
say
anything
that
would
please
me
so
much
for
men
are
made
for
happiness
and
any
one
who
is
completely
happy
has
a
right
to
say
to
himself
i
am
doing
god
s
will
on
earth
all
the
righteous
all
the
saints
all
the
holy
martyrs
were
happy
oh
how
you
speak
what
bold
and
lofty
words
cried
the
lady
you
seem
to
pierce
with
your
words
and
yet
happiness
happiness
where
is
it
who
can
say
of
himself
that
he
is
happy
oh
since
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
let
us
see
you
once
more
to
day
let
me
tell
you
what
i
could
not
utter
last
time
what
i
dared
not
say
all
i
am
suffering
and
have
been
for
so
long
i
am
suffering
forgive
me
i
am
suffering
and
in
a
rush
of
fervent
feeling
she
clasped
her
hands
before
him
from
what
specially
i
suffer
from
lack
of
faith
lack
of
faith
in
god
oh
no
no
i
dare
not
even
think
of
that
but
the
future
life
it
is
such
an
enigma
and
no
one
no
one
can
solve
it
listen
you
are
a
healer
you
are
deeply
versed
in
the
human
soul
and
of
course
i
dare
not
expect
you
to
believe
me
entirely
but
i
assure
you
on
my
word
of
honor
that
i
am
not
speaking
lightly
now
the
thought
of
the
life
beyond
the
grave
distracts
me
to
anguish
to
terror
and
i
don
t
know
to
whom
to
appeal
and
have
not
dared
to
all
my
life
and
now
i
am
so
bold
as
to
ask
you
oh
god
what
will
you
think
of
me
now
she
clasped
her
hands
don
t
distress
yourself
about
my
opinion
of
you
said
the
elder
i
quite
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
your
suffering
oh
how
thankful
i
am
to
you
you
see
i
shut
my
eyes
and
ask
myself
if
every
one
has
faith
where
did
it
come
from
and
then
they
do
say
that
it
all
comes
from
terror
at
the
menacing
phenomena
of
nature
and
that
none
of
it
s
real
and
i
say
to
myself
what
if
i
ve
been
believing
all
my
life
and
when
i
come
to
die
there
s
nothing
but
the
burdocks
growing
on
my
grave
as
i
read
in
some
author
it
s
awful
how
how
can
i
get
back
my
faith
but
i
only
believed
when
i
was
a
little
child
mechanically
without
thinking
of
anything
how
how
is
one
to
prove
it
i
have
come
now
to
lay
my
soul
before
you
and
to
ask
you
about
it
if
i
let
this
chance
slip
no
one
all
my
life
will
answer
me
how
can
i
prove
it
how
can
i
convince
myself
oh
how
unhappy
i
am
i
stand
and
look
about
me
and
see
that
scarcely
any
one
else
cares
no
one
troubles
his
head
about
it
and
i
m
the
only
one
who
can
t
stand
it
it
s
deadly
deadly
no
doubt
but
there
s
no
proving
it
though
you
can
be
convinced
of
it
how
by
the
experience
of
active
love
strive
to
love
your
neighbor
actively
and
indefatigably
in
as
far
as
you
advance
in
love
you
will
grow
surer
of
the
reality
of
god
and
of
the
immortality
of
your
soul
if
you
attain
to
perfect
self
forgetfulness
in
the
love
of
your
neighbor
then
you
will
believe
without
doubt
and
no
doubt
can
possibly
enter
your
soul
this
has
been
tried
this
is
certain
in
active
love
there
s
another
question
and
such
a
question
you
see
i
so
love
humanity
that
would
you
believe
it
i
often
dream
of
forsaking
all
that
i
have
leaving
lise
and
becoming
a
sister
of
mercy
i
close
my
eyes
and
think
and
dream
and
at
that
moment
i
feel
full
of
strength
to
overcome
all
obstacles
no
wounds
no
festering
sores
could
at
that
moment
frighten
me
i
would
bind
them
up
and
wash
them
with
my
own
hands
i
would
nurse
the
afflicted
i
would
be
ready
to
kiss
such
wounds
it
is
much
and
well
that
your
mind
is
full
of
such
dreams
and
not
others
sometime
unawares
you
may
do
a
good
deed
in
reality
yes
but
could
i
endure
such
a
life
for
long
the
lady
went
on
fervently
almost
frantically
that
s
the
chief
question
that
s
my
most
agonizing
question
i
shut
my
eyes
and
ask
myself
would
you
persevere
long
on
that
path
and
if
the
patient
whose
wounds
you
are
washing
did
not
meet
you
with
gratitude
but
worried
you
with
his
whims
without
valuing
or
remarking
your
charitable
services
began
abusing
you
and
rudely
commanding
you
and
complaining
to
the
superior
authorities
of
you
which
often
happens
when
people
are
in
great
suffering
what
then
would
you
persevere
in
your
love
or
not
and
do
you
know
i
came
with
horror
to
the
conclusion
that
if
anything
could
dissipate
my
love
to
humanity
it
would
be
ingratitude
in
short
i
am
a
hired
servant
i
expect
my
payment
at
once
that
is
praise
and
the
repayment
of
love
with
love
otherwise
i
am
incapable
of
loving
any
one
she
was
in
a
very
paroxysm
of
self
castigation
and
concluding
she
looked
with
defiant
resolution
at
the
elder
it
s
just
the
same
story
as
a
doctor
once
told
me
observed
the
elder
he
was
a
man
getting
on
in
years
and
undoubtedly
clever
he
spoke
as
frankly
as
you
though
in
jest
in
bitter
jest
i
love
humanity
he
said
but
i
wonder
at
myself
the
more
i
love
humanity
in
general
the
less
i
love
man
in
particular
in
my
dreams
he
said
i
have
often
come
to
making
enthusiastic
schemes
for
the
service
of
humanity
and
perhaps
i
might
actually
have
faced
crucifixion
if
it
had
been
suddenly
necessary
and
yet
i
am
incapable
of
living
in
the
same
room
with
any
one
for
two
days
together
as
i
know
by
experience
as
soon
as
any
one
is
near
me
his
personality
disturbs
my
self
complacency
and
restricts
my
freedom
in
twenty
four
hours
i
begin
to
hate
the
best
of
men
one
because
he
s
too
long
over
his
dinner
another
because
he
has
a
cold
and
keeps
on
blowing
his
nose
i
become
hostile
to
people
the
moment
they
come
close
to
me
but
it
has
always
happened
that
the
more
i
detest
men
individually
the
more
ardent
becomes
my
love
for
humanity
but
what
s
to
be
done
what
can
one
do
in
such
a
case
must
one
despair
no
it
is
enough
that
you
are
distressed
at
it
do
what
you
can
and
it
will
be
reckoned
unto
you
much
is
done
already
in
you
since
you
can
so
deeply
and
sincerely
know
yourself
if
you
have
been
talking
to
me
so
sincerely
simply
to
gain
approbation
for
your
frankness
as
you
did
from
me
just
now
then
of
course
you
will
not
attain
to
anything
in
the
achievement
of
real
love
it
will
all
get
no
further
than
dreams
and
your
whole
life
will
slip
away
like
a
phantom
in
that
case
you
will
naturally
cease
to
think
of
the
future
life
too
and
will
of
yourself
grow
calmer
after
a
fashion
in
the
end
you
have
crushed
me
only
now
as
you
speak
i
understand
that
i
was
really
only
seeking
your
approbation
for
my
sincerity
when
i
told
you
i
could
not
endure
ingratitude
you
have
revealed
me
to
myself
you
have
seen
through
me
and
explained
me
to
myself
are
you
speaking
the
truth
well
now
after
such
a
confession
i
believe
that
you
are
sincere
and
good
at
heart
if
you
do
not
attain
happiness
always
remember
that
you
are
on
the
right
road
and
try
not
to
leave
it
above
all
avoid
falsehood
every
kind
of
falsehood
especially
falseness
to
yourself
watch
over
your
own
deceitfulness
and
look
into
it
every
hour
every
minute
avoid
being
scornful
both
to
others
and
to
yourself
what
seems
to
you
bad
within
you
will
grow
purer
from
the
very
fact
of
your
observing
it
in
yourself
avoid
fear
too
though
fear
is
only
the
consequence
of
every
sort
of
falsehood
never
be
frightened
at
your
own
faint
heartedness
in
attaining
love
don
t
be
frightened
overmuch
even
at
your
evil
actions
i
am
sorry
i
can
say
nothing
more
consoling
to
you
for
love
in
action
is
a
harsh
and
dreadful
thing
compared
with
love
in
dreams
love
in
dreams
is
greedy
for
immediate
action
rapidly
performed
and
in
the
sight
of
all
men
will
even
give
their
lives
if
only
the
ordeal
does
not
last
long
but
is
soon
over
with
all
looking
on
and
applauding
as
though
on
the
stage
but
active
love
is
labor
and
fortitude
and
for
some
people
too
perhaps
a
complete
science
but
i
predict
that
just
when
you
see
with
horror
that
in
spite
of
all
your
efforts
you
are
getting
farther
from
your
goal
instead
of
nearer
to
it
at
that
very
moment
i
predict
that
you
will
reach
it
and
behold
clearly
the
miraculous
power
of
the
lord
who
has
been
all
the
time
loving
and
mysteriously
guiding
you
forgive
me
for
not
being
able
to
stay
longer
with
you
they
are
waiting
for
me
good
by
the
lady
was
weeping
lise
lise
bless
her
bless
her
she
cried
starting
up
suddenly
she
does
not
deserve
to
be
loved
i
have
seen
her
naughtiness
all
along
the
elder
said
jestingly
why
have
you
been
laughing
at
alexey
lise
had
in
fact
been
occupied
in
mocking
at
him
all
the
time
she
had
noticed
before
that
alyosha
was
shy
and
tried
not
to
look
at
her
and
she
found
this
extremely
amusing
she
waited
intently
to
catch
his
eye
alyosha
unable
to
endure
her
persistent
stare
was
irresistibly
and
suddenly
drawn
to
glance
at
her
and
at
once
she
smiled
triumphantly
in
his
face
alyosha
was
even
more
disconcerted
and
vexed
at
last
he
turned
away
from
her
altogether
and
hid
behind
the
elder
s
back
after
a
few
minutes
drawn
by
the
same
irresistible
force
he
turned
again
to
see
whether
he
was
being
looked
at
or
not
and
found
lise
almost
hanging
out
of
her
chair
to
peep
sideways
at
him
eagerly
waiting
for
him
to
look
catching
his
eye
she
laughed
so
that
the
elder
could
not
help
saying
why
do
you
make
fun
of
him
like
that
naughty
girl
lise
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
blushed
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
face
became
quite
serious
she
began
speaking
quickly
and
nervously
in
a
warm
and
resentful
voice
why
has
he
forgotten
everything
then
he
used
to
carry
me
about
when
i
was
little
we
used
to
play
together
he
used
to
come
to
teach
me
to
read
do
you
know
two
years
ago
when
he
went
away
he
said
that
he
would
never
forget
me
that
we
were
friends
for
ever
for
ever
for
ever
and
now
he
s
afraid
of
me
all
at
once
am
i
going
to
eat
him
why
doesn
t
he
want
to
come
near
me
why
doesn
t
he
talk
why
won
t
he
come
and
see
us
it
s
not
that
you
won
t
let
him
we
know
that
he
goes
everywhere
it
s
not
good
manners
for
me
to
invite
him
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
first
if
he
hasn
t
forgotten
me
no
now
he
s
saving
his
soul
why
have
you
put
that
long
gown
on
him
if
he
runs
he
ll
fall
and
suddenly
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hand
and
went
off
into
irresistible
prolonged
nervous
inaudible
laughter
the
elder
listened
to
her
with
a
smile
and
blessed
her
tenderly
as
she
kissed
his
hand
she
suddenly
pressed
it
to
her
eyes
and
began
crying
don
t
be
angry
with
me
i
m
silly
and
good
for
nothing
and
perhaps
alyosha
s
right
quite
right
in
not
wanting
to
come
and
see
such
a
ridiculous
girl
i
will
certainly
send
him
said
the
elder
chapter
v
so
be
it
so
be
it
the
elder
s
absence
from
his
cell
had
lasted
for
about
twenty
five
minutes
it
was
more
than
half
past
twelve
but
dmitri
on
whose
account
they
had
all
met
there
had
still
not
appeared
but
he
seemed
almost
to
be
forgotten
and
when
the
elder
entered
the
cell
again
he
found
his
guests
engaged
in
eager
conversation
ivan
and
the
two
monks
took
the
leading
share
in
it
mi
sov
too
was
trying
to
take
a
part
and
apparently
very
eagerly
in
the
conversation
but
he
was
unsuccessful
in
this
also
he
was
evidently
in
the
background
and
his
remarks
were
treated
with
neglect
which
increased
his
irritability
he
had
had
intellectual
encounters
with
ivan
before
and
he
could
not
endure
a
certain
carelessness
ivan
showed
him
hitherto
at
least
i
have
stood
in
the
front
ranks
of
all
that
is
progressive
in
europe
and
here
the
new
generation
positively
ignores
us
he
thought
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
had
given
his
word
to
sit
still
and
be
quiet
had
actually
been
quiet
for
some
time
but
he
watched
his
neighbor
mi
sov
with
an
ironical
little
smile
obviously
enjoying
his
discomfiture
he
had
been
waiting
for
some
time
to
pay
off
old
scores
and
now
he
could
not
let
the
opportunity
slip
bending
over
his
shoulder
he
began
teasing
him
again
in
a
whisper
why
didn
t
you
go
away
just
now
after
the
courteously
kissing
why
did
you
consent
to
remain
in
such
unseemly
company
it
was
because
you
felt
insulted
and
aggrieved
and
you
remained
to
vindicate
yourself
by
showing
off
your
intelligence
now
you
won
t
go
till
you
ve
displayed
your
intellect
to
them
you
again
on
the
contrary
i
m
just
going
you
ll
be
the
last
the
last
of
all
to
go
fyodor
pavlovitch
delivered
him
another
thrust
almost
at
the
moment
of
father
zossima
s
return
the
discussion
died
down
for
a
moment
but
the
elder
seating
himself
in
his
former
place
looked
at
them
all
as
though
cordially
inviting
them
to
go
on
alyosha
who
knew
every
expression
of
his
face
saw
that
he
was
fearfully
exhausted
and
making
a
great
effort
of
late
he
had
been
liable
to
fainting
fits
from
exhaustion
his
face
had
the
pallor
that
was
common
before
such
attacks
and
his
lips
were
white
but
he
evidently
did
not
want
to
break
up
the
party
he
seemed
to
have
some
special
object
of
his
own
in
keeping
them
what
object
alyosha
watched
him
intently
we
are
discussing
this
gentleman
s
most
interesting
article
said
father
iosif
the
librarian
addressing
the
elder
and
indicating
ivan
he
brings
forward
much
that
is
new
but
i
think
the
argument
cuts
both
ways
it
is
an
article
written
in
answer
to
a
book
by
an
ecclesiastical
authority
on
the
question
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
and
the
scope
of
its
jurisdiction
i
m
sorry
i
have
not
read
your
article
but
i
ve
heard
of
it
said
the
elder
looking
keenly
and
intently
at
ivan
he
takes
up
a
most
interesting
position
continued
the
father
librarian
as
far
as
church
jurisdiction
is
concerned
he
is
apparently
quite
opposed
to
the
separation
of
church
from
state
that
s
interesting
but
in
what
sense
father
zossima
asked
ivan
the
latter
at
last
answered
him
not
condescendingly
as
alyosha
had
feared
but
with
modesty
and
reserve
with
evident
goodwill
and
apparently
without
the
slightest
arri
re
pens
e
i
start
from
the
position
that
this
confusion
of
elements
that
is
of
the
essential
principles
of
church
and
state
will
of
course
go
on
for
ever
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
mingle
and
that
the
confusion
of
these
elements
cannot
lead
to
any
consistent
or
even
normal
results
for
there
is
falsity
at
the
very
foundation
of
it
compromise
between
the
church
and
state
in
such
questions
as
for
instance
jurisdiction
is
to
my
thinking
impossible
in
any
real
sense
my
clerical
opponent
maintains
that
the
church
holds
a
precise
and
defined
position
in
the
state
i
maintain
on
the
contrary
that
the
church
ought
to
include
the
whole
state
and
not
simply
to
occupy
a
corner
in
it
and
if
this
is
for
some
reason
impossible
at
present
then
it
ought
in
reality
to
be
set
up
as
the
direct
and
chief
aim
of
the
future
development
of
christian
society
perfectly
true
father
pa
ssy
the
silent
and
learned
monk
assented
with
fervor
and
decision
the
purest
ultramontanism
cried
mi
sov
impatiently
crossing
and
recrossing
his
legs
oh
well
we
have
no
mountains
cried
father
iosif
and
turning
to
the
elder
he
continued
observe
the
answer
he
makes
to
the
following
fundamental
and
essential
propositions
of
his
opponent
who
is
you
must
note
an
ecclesiastic
first
that
no
social
organization
can
or
ought
to
arrogate
to
itself
power
to
dispose
of
the
civic
and
political
rights
of
its
members
secondly
that
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
ought
not
to
belong
to
the
church
and
is
inconsistent
with
its
nature
both
as
a
divine
institution
and
as
an
organization
of
men
for
religious
objects
and
finally
in
the
third
place
the
church
is
a
kingdom
not
of
this
world
a
most
unworthy
play
upon
words
for
an
ecclesiastic
father
pa
ssy
could
not
refrain
from
breaking
in
again
i
have
read
the
book
which
you
have
answered
he
added
addressing
ivan
and
was
astounded
at
the
words
the
church
is
a
kingdom
not
of
this
world
if
it
is
not
of
this
world
then
it
cannot
exist
on
earth
at
all
in
the
gospel
the
words
not
of
this
world
are
not
used
in
that
sense
to
play
with
such
words
is
indefensible
our
lord
jesus
christ
came
to
set
up
the
church
upon
earth
the
kingdom
of
heaven
of
course
is
not
of
this
world
but
in
heaven
but
it
is
only
entered
through
the
church
which
has
been
founded
and
established
upon
earth
and
so
a
frivolous
play
upon
words
in
such
a
connection
is
unpardonable
and
improper
the
church
is
in
truth
a
kingdom
and
ordained
to
rule
and
in
the
end
must
undoubtedly
become
the
kingdom
ruling
over
all
the
earth
for
that
we
have
the
divine
promise
he
ceased
speaking
suddenly
as
though
checking
himself
after
listening
attentively
and
respectfully
ivan
went
on
addressing
the
elder
with
perfect
composure
and
as
before
with
ready
cordiality
the
whole
point
of
my
article
lies
in
the
fact
that
during
the
first
three
centuries
christianity
only
existed
on
earth
in
the
church
and
was
nothing
but
the
church
when
the
pagan
roman
empire
desired
to
become
christian
it
inevitably
happened
that
by
becoming
christian
it
included
the
church
but
remained
a
pagan
state
in
very
many
of
its
departments
in
reality
this
was
bound
to
happen
but
rome
as
a
state
retained
too
much
of
the
pagan
civilization
and
culture
as
for
example
in
the
very
objects
and
fundamental
principles
of
the
state
the
christian
church
entering
into
the
state
could
of
course
surrender
no
part
of
its
fundamental
principles
the
rock
on
which
it
stands
and
could
pursue
no
other
aims
than
those
which
have
been
ordained
and
revealed
by
god
himself
and
among
them
that
of
drawing
the
whole
world
and
therefore
the
ancient
pagan
state
itself
into
the
church
in
that
way
that
is
with
a
view
to
the
future
it
is
not
the
church
that
should
seek
a
definite
position
in
the
state
like
every
social
organization
or
as
an
organization
of
men
for
religious
purposes
as
my
opponent
calls
the
church
but
on
the
contrary
every
earthly
state
should
be
in
the
end
completely
transformed
into
the
church
and
should
become
nothing
else
but
a
church
rejecting
every
purpose
incongruous
with
the
aims
of
the
church
all
this
will
not
degrade
it
in
any
way
or
take
from
its
honor
and
glory
as
a
great
state
nor
from
the
glory
of
its
rulers
but
only
turns
it
from
a
false
still
pagan
and
mistaken
path
to
the
true
and
rightful
path
which
alone
leads
to
the
eternal
goal
this
is
why
the
author
of
the
book
on
the
foundations
of
church
jurisdiction
would
have
judged
correctly
if
in
seeking
and
laying
down
those
foundations
he
had
looked
upon
them
as
a
temporary
compromise
inevitable
in
our
sinful
and
imperfect
days
but
as
soon
as
the
author
ventures
to
declare
that
the
foundations
which
he
predicates
now
part
of
which
father
iosif
just
enumerated
are
the
permanent
essential
and
eternal
foundations
he
is
going
directly
against
the
church
and
its
sacred
and
eternal
vocation
that
is
the
gist
of
my
article
that
is
in
brief
father
pa
ssy
began
again
laying
stress
on
each
word
according
to
certain
theories
only
too
clearly
formulated
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
church
ought
to
be
transformed
into
the
state
as
though
this
would
be
an
advance
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
form
so
as
to
disappear
into
it
making
way
for
science
for
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
civilization
and
if
the
church
resists
and
is
unwilling
some
corner
will
be
set
apart
for
her
in
the
state
and
even
that
under
control
and
this
will
be
so
everywhere
in
all
modern
european
countries
but
russian
hopes
and
conceptions
demand
not
that
the
church
should
pass
as
from
a
lower
into
a
higher
type
into
the
state
but
on
the
contrary
that
the
state
should
end
by
being
worthy
to
become
only
the
church
and
nothing
else
so
be
it
so
be
it
well
i
confess
you
ve
reassured
me
somewhat
mi
sov
said
smiling
again
crossing
his
legs
so
far
as
i
understand
then
the
realization
of
such
an
ideal
is
infinitely
remote
at
the
second
coming
of
christ
that
s
as
you
please
it
s
a
beautiful
utopian
dream
of
the
abolition
of
war
diplomacy
banks
and
so
on
something
after
the
fashion
of
socialism
indeed
but
i
imagined
that
it
was
all
meant
seriously
and
that
the
church
might
be
now
going
to
try
criminals
and
sentence
them
to
beating
prison
and
even
death
but
if
there
were
none
but
the
ecclesiastical
court
the
church
would
not
even
now
sentence
a
criminal
to
prison
or
to
death
crime
and
the
way
of
regarding
it
would
inevitably
change
not
all
at
once
of
course
but
fairly
soon
ivan
replied
calmly
without
flinching
are
you
serious
mi
sov
glanced
keenly
at
him
if
everything
became
the
church
the
church
would
exclude
all
the
criminal
and
disobedient
and
would
not
cut
off
their
heads
ivan
went
on
i
ask
you
what
would
become
of
the
excluded
he
would
be
cut
off
then
not
only
from
men
as
now
but
from
christ
by
his
crime
he
would
have
transgressed
not
only
against
men
but
against
the
church
of
christ
this
is
so
even
now
of
course
strictly
speaking
but
it
is
not
clearly
enunciated
and
very
very
often
the
criminal
of
to
day
compromises
with
his
conscience
i
steal
he
says
but
i
don
t
go
against
the
church
i
m
not
an
enemy
of
christ
that
s
what
the
criminal
of
to
day
is
continually
saying
to
himself
but
when
the
church
takes
the
place
of
the
state
it
will
be
difficult
for
him
in
opposition
to
the
church
all
over
the
world
to
say
all
men
are
mistaken
all
in
error
all
mankind
are
the
false
church
i
a
thief
and
murderer
am
the
only
true
christian
church
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
say
this
to
himself
it
requires
a
rare
combination
of
unusual
circumstances
now
on
the
other
side
take
the
church
s
own
view
of
crime
is
it
not
bound
to
renounce
the
present
almost
pagan
attitude
and
to
change
from
a
mechanical
cutting
off
of
its
tainted
member
for
the
preservation
of
society
as
at
present
into
completely
and
honestly
adopting
the
idea
of
the
regeneration
of
the
man
of
his
reformation
and
salvation
what
do
you
mean
i
fail
to
understand
again
mi
sov
interrupted
some
sort
of
dream
again
something
shapeless
and
even
incomprehensible
what
is
excommunication
what
sort
of
exclusion
i
suspect
you
are
simply
amusing
yourself
ivan
fyodorovitch
yes
but
you
know
in
reality
it
is
so
now
said
the
elder
suddenly
and
all
turned
to
him
at
once
if
it
were
not
for
the
church
of
christ
there
would
be
nothing
to
restrain
the
criminal
from
evil
doing
no
real
chastisement
for
it
afterwards
none
that
is
but
the
mechanical
punishment
spoken
of
just
now
which
in
the
majority
of
cases
only
embitters
the
heart
and
not
the
real
punishment
the
only
effectual
one
the
only
deterrent
and
softening
one
which
lies
in
the
recognition
of
sin
by
conscience
how
is
that
may
one
inquire
asked
mi
sov
with
lively
curiosity
why
began
the
elder
all
these
sentences
to
exile
with
hard
labor
and
formerly
with
flogging
also
reform
no
one
and
what
s
more
deter
hardly
a
single
criminal
and
the
number
of
crimes
does
not
diminish
but
is
continually
on
the
increase
you
must
admit
that
consequently
the
security
of
society
is
not
preserved
for
although
the
obnoxious
member
is
mechanically
cut
off
and
sent
far
away
out
of
sight
another
criminal
always
comes
to
take
his
place
at
once
and
often
two
of
them
if
anything
does
preserve
society
even
in
our
time
and
does
regenerate
and
transform
the
criminal
it
is
only
the
law
of
christ
speaking
in
his
conscience
it
is
only
by
recognizing
his
wrong
doing
as
a
son
of
a
christian
society
that
is
of
the
church
that
he
recognizes
his
sin
against
society
that
is
against
the
church
so
that
it
is
only
against
the
church
and
not
against
the
state
that
the
criminal
of
to
day
can
recognize
that
he
has
sinned
if
society
as
a
church
had
jurisdiction
then
it
would
know
when
to
bring
back
from
exclusion
and
to
reunite
to
itself
now
the
church
having
no
real
jurisdiction
but
only
the
power
of
moral
condemnation
withdraws
of
her
own
accord
from
punishing
the
criminal
actively
she
does
not
excommunicate
him
but
simply
persists
in
motherly
exhortation
of
him
what
is
more
the
church
even
tries
to
preserve
all
christian
communion
with
the
criminal
she
admits
him
to
church
services
to
the
holy
sacrament
gives
him
alms
and
treats
him
more
as
a
captive
than
as
a
convict
and
what
would
become
of
the
criminal
o
lord
if
even
the
christian
society
that
is
the
church
were
to
reject
him
even
as
the
civil
law
rejects
him
and
cuts
him
off
what
would
become
of
him
if
the
church
punished
him
with
her
excommunication
as
the
direct
consequence
of
the
secular
law
there
could
be
no
more
terrible
despair
at
least
for
a
russian
criminal
for
russian
criminals
still
have
faith
though
who
knows
perhaps
then
a
fearful
thing
would
happen
perhaps
the
despairing
heart
of
the
criminal
would
lose
its
faith
and
then
what
would
become
of
him
but
the
church
like
a
tender
loving
mother
holds
aloof
from
active
punishment
herself
as
the
sinner
is
too
severely
punished
already
by
the
civil
law
and
there
must
be
at
least
some
one
to
have
pity
on
him
the
church
holds
aloof
above
all
because
its
judgment
is
the
only
one
that
contains
the
truth
and
therefore
cannot
practically
and
morally
be
united
to
any
other
judgment
even
as
a
temporary
compromise
she
can
enter
into
no
compact
about
that
the
foreign
criminal
they
say
rarely
repents
for
the
very
doctrines
of
to
day
confirm
him
in
the
idea
that
his
crime
is
not
a
crime
but
only
a
reaction
against
an
unjustly
oppressive
force
society
cuts
him
off
completely
by
a
force
that
triumphs
over
him
mechanically
and
so
at
least
they
say
of
themselves
in
europe
accompanies
this
exclusion
with
hatred
forgetfulness
and
the
most
profound
indifference
as
to
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
erring
brother
in
this
way
it
all
takes
place
without
the
compassionate
intervention
of
the
church
for
in
many
cases
there
are
no
churches
there
at
all
for
though
ecclesiastics
and
splendid
church
buildings
remain
the
churches
themselves
have
long
ago
striven
to
pass
from
church
into
state
and
to
disappear
in
it
completely
so
it
seems
at
least
in
lutheran
countries
as
for
rome
it
was
proclaimed
a
state
instead
of
a
church
a
thousand
years
ago
and
so
the
criminal
is
no
longer
conscious
of
being
a
member
of
the
church
and
sinks
into
despair
if
he
returns
to
society
often
it
is
with
such
hatred
that
society
itself
instinctively
cuts
him
off
you
can
judge
for
yourself
how
it
must
end
in
many
cases
it
would
seem
to
be
the
same
with
us
but
the
difference
is
that
besides
the
established
law
courts
we
have
the
church
too
which
always
keeps
up
relations
with
the
criminal
as
a
dear
and
still
precious
son
and
besides
that
there
is
still
preserved
though
only
in
thought
the
judgment
of
the
church
which
though
no
longer
existing
in
practice
is
still
living
as
a
dream
for
the
future
and
is
no
doubt
instinctively
recognized
by
the
criminal
in
his
soul
what
was
said
here
just
now
is
true
too
that
is
that
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
church
were
introduced
in
practice
in
its
full
force
that
is
if
the
whole
of
the
society
were
changed
into
the
church
not
only
the
judgment
of
the
church
would
have
influence
on
the
reformation
of
the
criminal
such
as
it
never
has
now
but
possibly
also
the
crimes
themselves
would
be
incredibly
diminished
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
church
would
look
upon
the
criminal
and
the
crime
of
the
future
in
many
cases
quite
differently
and
would
succeed
in
restoring
the
excluded
in
restraining
those
who
plan
evil
and
in
regenerating
the
fallen
it
is
true
said
father
zossima
with
a
smile
the
christian
society
now
is
not
ready
and
is
only
resting
on
some
seven
righteous
men
but
as
they
are
never
lacking
it
will
continue
still
unshaken
in
expectation
of
its
complete
transformation
from
a
society
almost
heathen
in
character
into
a
single
universal
and
all
powerful
church
so
be
it
so
be
it
even
though
at
the
end
of
the
ages
for
it
is
ordained
to
come
to
pass
and
there
is
no
need
to
be
troubled
about
times
and
seasons
for
the
secret
of
the
times
and
seasons
is
in
the
wisdom
of
god
in
his
foresight
and
his
love
and
what
in
human
reckoning
seems
still
afar
off
may
by
the
divine
ordinance
be
close
at
hand
on
the
eve
of
its
appearance
and

extraordinary
personal

a
supercilious
and
condescending
smile
played
on
his

alyosha
watched
it
all
with
a
throbbing
heart
the
whole
conversation
stirred
him
profoundly
he
glanced
casually
at
rakitin
who
was
standing
immovable
in
his
place
by
the
door
listening
and
watching
intently
though
with
downcast
eyes
but
from
the
color
in
his
cheeks
alyosha
guessed
that
rakitin
was
probably
no
less
excited
and
he
knew
what
caused
his
excitement
allow
me
to
tell
you
one
little
anecdote
gentlemen
mi
sov
said
impressively
with
a
peculiarly
majestic
air
some
years
ago
soon
after
the
coup
d
tat
of
december
i
happened
to
be
calling
in
paris
on
an
extremely
influential
personage
in
the
government
and
i
met
a
very
interesting
man
in
his
house
this
individual
was
not
precisely
a
detective
but
was
a
sort
of
superintendent
of
a
whole
regiment
of
political
detectives
a
rather
powerful
position
in
its
own
way
i
was
prompted
by
curiosity
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
conversation
with
him
and
as
he
had
not
come
as
a
visitor
but
as
a
subordinate
official
bringing
a
special
report
and
as
he
saw
the
reception
given
me
by
his
chief
he
deigned
to
speak
with
some
openness
to
a
certain
extent
only
of
course
he
was
rather
courteous
than
open
as
frenchmen
know
how
to
be
courteous
especially
to
a
foreigner
but
i
thoroughly
understood
him
the
subject
was
the
socialist
revolutionaries
who
were
at
that
time
persecuted
i
will
quote
only
one
most
curious
remark
dropped
by
this
person
we
are
not
particularly
afraid
said
he
of
all
these
socialists
anarchists
infidels
and
revolutionists
we
keep
watch
on
them
and
know
all
their
goings
on
but
there
are
a
few
peculiar
men
among
them
who
believe
in
god
and
are
christians
but
at
the
same
time
are
socialists
these
are
the
people
we
are
most
afraid
of
they
are
dreadful
people
the
socialist
who
is
a
christian
is
more
to
be
dreaded
than
a
socialist
who
is
an
atheist
the
words
struck
me
at
the
time
and
now
they
have
suddenly
come
back
to
me
here
gentlemen
you
apply
them
to
us
and
look
upon
us
as
socialists
father
pa
ssy
asked
directly
without
beating
about
the
bush
but
before
pyotr
alexandrovitch
could
think
what
to
answer
the
door
opened
and
the
guest
so
long
expected
dmitri
fyodorovitch
came
in
they
had
in
fact
given
up
expecting
him
and
his
sudden
appearance
caused
some
surprise
for
a
moment
chapter
vi
why
is
such
a
man
alive
dmitri
fyodorovitch
a
young
man
of
eight
and
twenty
of
medium
height
and
agreeable
countenance
looked
older
than
his
years
he
was
muscular
and
showed
signs
of
considerable
physical
strength
yet
there
was
something
not
healthy
in
his
face
it
was
rather
thin
his
cheeks
were
hollow
and
there
was
an
unhealthy
sallowness
in
their
color
his
rather
large
prominent
dark
eyes
had
an
expression
of
firm
determination
and
yet
there
was
a
vague
look
in
them
too
even
when
he
was
excited
and
talking
irritably
his
eyes
somehow
did
not
follow
his
mood
but
betrayed
something
else
sometimes
quite
incongruous
with
what
was
passing
it
s
hard
to
tell
what
he
s
thinking
those
who
talked
to
him
sometimes
declared
people
who
saw
something
pensive
and
sullen
in
his
eyes
were
startled
by
his
sudden
laugh
which
bore
witness
to
mirthful
and
light
hearted
thoughts
at
the
very
time
when
his
eyes
were
so
gloomy
a
certain
strained
look
in
his
face
was
easy
to
understand
at
this
moment
every
one
knew
or
had
heard
of
the
extremely
restless
and
dissipated
life
which
he
had
been
leading
of
late
as
well
as
of
the
violent
anger
to
which
he
had
been
roused
in
his
quarrels
with
his
father
there
were
several
stories
current
in
the
town
about
it
it
is
true
that
he
was
irascible
by
nature
of
an
unstable
and
unbalanced
mind
as
our
justice
of
the
peace
katchalnikov
happily
described
him
he
was
stylishly
and
irreproachably
dressed
in
a
carefully
buttoned
frock
coat
he
wore
black
gloves
and
carried
a
top
hat
having
only
lately
left
the
army
he
still
had
mustaches
and
no
beard
his
dark
brown
hair
was
cropped
short
and
combed
forward
on
his
temples
he
had
the
long
determined
stride
of
a
military
man
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
and
glancing
at
the
whole
party
went
straight
up
to
the
elder
guessing
him
to
be
their
host
he
made
him
a
low
bow
and
asked
his
blessing
father
zossima
rising
in
his
chair
blessed
him
dmitri
kissed
his
hand
respectfully
and
with
intense
feeling
almost
anger
he
said
be
so
generous
as
to
forgive
me
for
having
kept
you
waiting
so
long
but
smerdyakov
the
valet
sent
me
by
my
father
in
reply
to
my
inquiries
told
me
twice
over
that
the
appointment
was
for
one
now
i
suddenly
learn
don
t
disturb
yourself
interposed
the
elder
no
matter
you
are
a
little
late
it
s
of
no
consequence
i
m
extremely
obliged
to
you
and
expected
no
less
from
your
goodness
saying
this
dmitri
bowed
once
more
then
turning
suddenly
towards
his
father
made
him
too
a
similarly
low
and
respectful
bow
he
had
evidently
considered
it
beforehand
and
made
this
bow
in
all
seriousness
thinking
it
his
duty
to
show
his
respect
and
good
intentions
although
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
taken
unawares
he
was
equal
to
the
occasion
in
response
to
dmitri
s
bow
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
made
his
son
a
bow
as
low
in
return
his
face
was
suddenly
solemn
and
impressive
which
gave
him
a
positively
malignant
look
dmitri
bowed
generally
to
all
present
and
without
a
word
walked
to
the
window
with
his
long
resolute
stride
sat
down
on
the
only
empty
chair
near
father
pa
ssy
and
bending
forward
prepared
to
listen
to
the
conversation
he
had
interrupted
dmitri
s
entrance
had
taken
no
more
than
two
minutes
and
the
conversation
was
resumed
but
this
time
mi
sov
thought
it
unnecessary
to
reply
to
father
pa
ssy
s
persistent
and
almost
irritable
question
allow
me
to
withdraw
from
this
discussion
he
observed
with
a
certain
well
bred
nonchalance
it
s
a
subtle
question
too
here
ivan
fyodorovitch
is
smiling
at
us
he
must
have
something
interesting
to
say
about
that
also
ask
him
nothing
special
except
one
little
remark
ivan
replied
at
once
european
liberals
in
general
and
even
our
liberal
dilettanti
often
mix
up
the
final
results
of
socialism
with
those
of
christianity
this
wild
notion
is
of
course
a
characteristic
feature
but
it
s
not
only
liberals
and
dilettanti
who
mix
up
socialism
and
christianity
but
in
many
cases
it
appears
the
police
the
foreign
police
of
course
do
the
same
your
paris
anecdote
is
rather
to
the
point
pyotr
alexandrovitch
i
ask
your
permission
to
drop
this
subject
altogether
mi
sov
repeated
i
will
tell
you
instead
gentlemen
another
interesting
and
rather
characteristic
anecdote
of
ivan
fyodorovitch
himself
only
five
days
ago
in
a
gathering
here
principally
of
ladies
he
solemnly
declared
in
argument
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
whole
world
to
make
men
love
their
neighbors
that
there
was
no
law
of
nature
that
man
should
love
mankind
and
that
if
there
had
been
any
love
on
earth
hitherto
it
was
not
owing
to
a
natural
law
but
simply
because
men
have
believed
in
immortality
ivan
fyodorovitch
added
in
parenthesis
that
the
whole
natural
law
lies
in
that
faith
and
that
if
you
were
to
destroy
in
mankind
the
belief
in
immortality
not
only
love
but
every
living
force
maintaining
the
life
of
the
world
would
at
once
be
dried
up
moreover
nothing
then
would
be
immoral
everything
would
be
lawful
even
cannibalism
that
s
not
all
he
ended
by
asserting
that
for
every
individual
like
ourselves
who
does
not
believe
in
god
or
immortality
the
moral
law
of
nature
must
immediately
be
changed
into
the
exact
contrary
of
the
former
religious
law
and
that
egoism
even
to
crime
must
become
not
only
lawful
but
even
recognized
as
the
inevitable
the
most
rational
even
honorable
outcome
of
his
position
from
this
paradox
gentlemen
you
can
judge
of
the
rest
of
our
eccentric
and
paradoxical
friend
ivan
fyodorovitch
s
theories
excuse
me
dmitri
cried
suddenly
if
i
ve
heard
aright
crime
must
not
only
be
permitted
but
even
recognized
as
the
inevitable
and
the
most
rational
outcome
of
his
position
for
every
infidel
is
that
so
or
not
quite
so
said
father
pa
ssy
i
ll
remember
it
having
uttered
these
words
dmitri
ceased
speaking
as
suddenly
as
he
had
begun
every
one
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
is
that
really
your
conviction
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
disappearance
of
the
faith
in
immortality
the
elder
asked
ivan
suddenly
yes
that
was
my
contention
there
is
no
virtue
if
there
is
no
immortality
you
are
blessed
in
believing
that
or
else
most
unhappy
why
unhappy
ivan
asked
smiling
because
in
all
probability
you
don
t
believe
yourself
in
the
immortality
of
your
soul
nor
in
what
you
have
written
yourself
in
your
article
on
church
jurisdiction
perhaps
you
are
right
but
i
wasn
t
altogether
joking
ivan
suddenly
and
strangely
confessed
flushing
quickly
you
were
not
altogether
joking
that
s
true
the
question
is
still
fretting
your
heart
and
not
answered
but
the
martyr
likes
sometimes
to
divert
himself
with
his
despair
as
it
were
driven
to
it
by
despair
itself
meanwhile
in
your
despair
you
too
divert
yourself
with
magazine
articles
and
discussions
in
society
though
you
don
t
believe
your
own
arguments
and
with
an
aching
heart
mock
at
them
inwardly
that
question
you
have
not
answered
and
it
is
your
great
grief
for
it
clamors
for
an
answer
but
can
it
be
answered
by
me
answered
in
the
affirmative
ivan
went
on
asking
strangely
still
looking
at
the
elder
with
the
same
inexplicable
smile
if
it
can
t
be
decided
in
the
affirmative
it
will
never
be
decided
in
the
negative
you
know
that
that
is
the
peculiarity
of
your
heart
and
all
its
suffering
is
due
to
it
but
thank
the
creator
who
has
given
you
a
lofty
heart
capable
of
such
suffering
of
thinking
and
seeking
higher
things
for
our
dwelling
is
in
the
heavens
god
grant
that
your
heart
will
attain
the
answer
on
earth
and
may
god
bless
your
path
the
elder
raised
his
hand
and
would
have
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
ivan
from
where
he
stood
but
the
latter
rose
from
his
seat
went
up
to
him
received
his
blessing
and
kissing
his
hand
went
back
to
his
place
in
silence
his
face
looked
firm
and
earnest
this
action
and
all
the
preceding
conversation
which
was
so
surprising
from
ivan
impressed
every
one
by
its
strangeness
and
a
certain
solemnity
so
that
all
were
silent
for
a
moment
and
there
was
a
look
almost
of
apprehension
in
alyosha
s
face
but
mi
sov
suddenly
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
at
the
same
moment
fyodor
pavlovitch
jumped
up
from
his
seat
most
pious
and
holy
elder
he
cried
pointing
to
ivan
that
is
my
son
flesh
of
my
flesh
the
dearest
of
my
flesh
he
is
my
most
dutiful
karl
moor
so
to
speak
while
this
son
who
has
just
come
in
dmitri
against
whom
i
am
seeking
justice
from
you
is
the
undutiful
franz
moor
they
are
both
out
of
schiller
s
robbers
and
so
i
am
the
reigning
count
von
moor
judge
and
save
us
we
need
not
only
your
prayers
but
your
prophecies
speak
without
buffoonery
and
don
t
begin
by
insulting
the
members
of
your
family
answered
the
elder
in
a
faint
exhausted
voice
he
was
obviously
getting
more
and
more
fatigued
and
his
strength
was
failing
an
unseemly
farce
which
i
foresaw
when
i
came
here
cried
dmitri
indignantly
he
too
leapt
up
forgive
it
reverend
father
he
added
addressing
the
elder
i
am
not
a
cultivated
man
and
i
don
t
even
know
how
to
address
you
properly
but
you
have
been
deceived
and
you
have
been
too
good
natured
in
letting
us
meet
here
all
my
father
wants
is
a
scandal
why
he
wants
it
only
he
can
tell
he
always
has
some
motive
but
i
believe
i
know
why
they
all
blame
me
all
of
them
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
his
turn
pyotr
alexandrovitch
here
blames
me
too
you
have
been
blaming
me
pyotr
alexandrovitch
you
have
he
turned
suddenly
to
mi
sov
although
the
latter
was
not
dreaming
of
interrupting
him
they
all
accuse
me
of
having
hidden
the
children
s
money
in
my
boots
and
cheated
them
but
isn
t
there
a
court
of
law
there
they
will
reckon
out
for
you
dmitri
fyodorovitch
from
your
notes
your
letters
and
your
agreements
how
much
money
you
had
how
much
you
have
spent
and
how
much
you
have
left
why
does
pyotr
alexandrovitch
refuse
to
pass
judgment
dmitri
is
not
a
stranger
to
him
because
they
are
all
against
me
while
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
in
debt
to
me
and
not
a
little
but
some
thousands
of
which
i
have
documentary
proof
the
whole
town
is
echoing
with
his
debaucheries
and
where
he
was
stationed
before
he
several
times
spent
a
thousand
or
two
for
the
seduction
of
some
respectable
girl
we
know
all
about
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
in
its
most
secret
details
i
ll
prove
it
would
you
believe
it
holy
father
he
has
captivated
the
heart
of
the
most
honorable
of
young
ladies
of
good
family
and
fortune
daughter
of
a
gallant
colonel
formerly
his
superior
officer
who
had
received
many
honors
and
had
the
anna
order
on
his
breast
he
compromised
the
girl
by
his
promise
of
marriage
now
she
is
an
orphan
and
here
she
is
betrothed
to
him
yet
before
her
very
eyes
he
is
dancing
attendance
on
a
certain
enchantress
and
although
this
enchantress
has
lived
in
so
to
speak
civil
marriage
with
a
respectable
man
yet
she
is
of
an
independent
character
an
unapproachable
fortress
for
everybody
just
like
a
legal
wife
for
she
is
virtuous
yes
holy
fathers
she
is
virtuous
dmitri
fyodorovitch
wants
to
open
this
fortress
with
a
golden
key
and
that
s
why
he
is
insolent
to
me
now
trying
to
get
money
from
me
though
he
has
wasted
thousands
on
this
enchantress
already
he
s
continually
borrowing
money
for
the
purpose
from
whom
do
you
think
shall
i
say
mitya
be
silent
cried
dmitri
wait
till
i
m
gone
don
t
dare
in
my
presence
to
asperse
the
good
name
of
an
honorable
girl
that
you
should
utter
a
word
about
her
is
an
outrage
and
i
won
t
permit
it
he
was
breathless
mitya
mitya
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
hysterically
squeezing
out
a
tear
and
is
your
father
s
blessing
nothing
to
you
if
i
curse
you
what
then
shameless
hypocrite
exclaimed
dmitri
furiously
he
says
that
to
his
father
his
father
what
would
he
be
with
others
gentlemen
only
fancy
there
s
a
poor
but
honorable
man
living
here
burdened
with
a
numerous
family
a
captain
who
got
into
trouble
and
was
discharged
from
the
army
but
not
publicly
not
by
court
martial
with
no
slur
on
his
honor
and
three
weeks
ago
dmitri
seized
him
by
the
beard
in
a
tavern
dragged
him
out
into
the
street
and
beat
him
publicly
and
all
because
he
is
an
agent
in
a
little
business
of
mine
it
s
all
a
lie
outwardly
it
s
the
truth
but
inwardly
a
lie
dmitri
was
trembling
with
rage
father
i
don
t
justify
my
action
yes
i
confess
it
publicly
i
behaved
like
a
brute
to
that
captain
and
i
regret
it
now
and
i
m
disgusted
with
myself
for
my
brutal
rage
but
this
captain
this
agent
of
yours
went
to
that
lady
whom
you
call
an
enchantress
and
suggested
to
her
from
you
that
she
should
take
i
o
u
s
of
mine
which
were
in
your
possession
and
should
sue
me
for
the
money
so
as
to
get
me
into
prison
by
means
of
them
if
i
persisted
in
claiming
an
account
from
you
of
my
property
now
you
reproach
me
for
having
a
weakness
for
that
lady
when
you
yourself
incited
her
to
captivate
me
she
told
me
so
to
my
face
she
told
me
the
story
and
laughed
at
you
you
wanted
to
put
me
in
prison
because
you
are
jealous
of
me
with
her
because
you
d
begun
to
force
your
attentions
upon
her
and
i
know
all
about
that
too
she
laughed
at
you
for
that
as
well
you
hear
she
laughed
at
you
as
she
described
it
so
here
you
have
this
man
this
father
who
reproaches
his
profligate
son
gentlemen
forgive
my
anger
but
i
foresaw
that
this
crafty
old
man
would
only
bring
you
together
to
create
a
scandal
i
had
come
to
forgive
him
if
he
held
out
his
hand
to
forgive
him
and
ask
forgiveness
but
as
he
has
just
this
minute
insulted
not
only
me
but
an
honorable
young
lady
for
whom
i
feel
such
reverence
that
i
dare
not
take
her
name
in
vain
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
show
up
his
game
though
he
is
my
father
he
could
not
go
on
his
eyes
were
glittering
and
he
breathed
with
difficulty
but
every
one
in
the
cell
was
stirred
all
except
father
zossima
got
up
from
their
seats
uneasily
the
monks
looked
austere
but
waited
for
guidance
from
the
elder
he
sat
still
pale
not
from
excitement
but
from
the
weakness
of
disease
an
imploring
smile
lighted
up
his
face
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
hand
as
though
to
check
the
storm
and
of
course
a
gesture
from
him
would
have
been
enough
to
end
the
scene
but
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
and
watched
them
intently
as
though
trying
to
make
out
something
which
was
not
perfectly
clear
to
him
at
last
mi
sov
felt
completely
humiliated
and
disgraced
we
are
all
to
blame
for
this
scandalous
scene
he
said
hotly
but
i
did
not
foresee
it
when
i
came
though
i
knew
with
whom
i
had
to
deal
this
must
be
stopped
at
once
believe
me
your
reverence
i
had
no
precise
knowledge
of
the
details
that
have
just
come
to
light
i
was
unwilling
to
believe
them
and
i
learn
for
the
first
time
a
father
is
jealous
of
his
son
s
relations
with
a
woman
of
loose
behavior
and
intrigues
with
the
creature
to
get
his
son
into
prison
this
is
the
company
in
which
i
have
been
forced
to
be
present
i
was
deceived
i
declare
to
you
all
that
i
was
as
much
deceived
as
any
one
dmitri
fyodorovitch
yelled
fyodor
pavlovitch
suddenly
in
an
unnatural
voice
if
you
were
not
my
son
i
would
challenge
you
this
instant
to
a
duel
with
pistols
at
three
paces
across
a
handkerchief
he
ended
stamping
with
both
feet
with
old
liars
who
have
been
acting
all
their
lives
there
are
moments
when
they
enter
so
completely
into
their
part
that
they
tremble
or
shed
tears
of
emotion
in
earnest
although
at
that
very
moment
or
a
second
later
they
are
able
to
whisper
to
themselves
you
know
you
are
lying
you
shameless
old
sinner
you
re
acting
now
in
spite
of
your
holy
wrath
dmitri
frowned
painfully
and
looked
with
unutterable
contempt
at
his
father
i
thought
i
thought
he
said
in
a
soft
and
as
it
were
controlled
voice
that
i
was
coming
to
my
native
place
with
the
angel
of
my
heart
my
betrothed
to
cherish
his
old
age
and
i
find
nothing
but
a
depraved
profligate
a
despicable
clown
a
duel
yelled
the
old
wretch
again
breathless
and
spluttering
at
each
syllable
and
you
pyotr
alexandrovitch
mi
sov
let
me
tell
you
that
there
has
never
been
in
all
your
family
a
loftier
and
more
honest
you
hear
more
honest
woman
than
this
creature
as
you
have
dared
to
call
her
and
you
dmitri
fyodorovitch
have
abandoned
your
betrothed
for
that
creature
so
you
must
yourself
have
thought
that
your
betrothed
couldn
t
hold
a
candle
to
her
that
s
the
woman
called
a
creature
shameful
broke
from
father
iosif
shameful
and
disgraceful
kalganov
flushing
crimson
cried
in
a
boyish
voice
trembling
with
emotion
he
had
been
silent
till
that
moment
why
is
such
a
man
alive
dmitri
beside
himself
with
rage
growled
in
a
hollow
voice
hunching
up
his
shoulders
till
he
looked
almost
deformed
tell
me
can
he
be
allowed
to
go
on
defiling
the
earth
he
looked
round
at
every
one
and
pointed
at
the
old
man
he
spoke
evenly
and
deliberately
listen
listen
monks
to
the
parricide
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
rushing
up
to
father
iosif
that
s
the
answer
to
your
shameful
what
is
shameful
that
creature
that
woman
of
loose
behavior
is
perhaps
holier
than
you
are
yourselves
you
monks
who
are
seeking
salvation
she
fell
perhaps
in
her
youth
ruined
by
her
environment
but
she
loved
much
and
christ
himself
forgave
the
woman
who
loved
much
it
was
not
for
such
love
christ
forgave
her
broke
impatiently
from
the
gentle
father
iosif
yes
it
was
for
such
monks
it
was
you
save
your
souls
here
eating
cabbage
and
think
you
are
the
righteous
you
eat
a
gudgeon
a
day
and
you
think
you
bribe
god
with
gudgeon
this
is
unendurable
was
heard
on
all
sides
in
the
cell
but
this
unseemly
scene
was
cut
short
in
a
most
unexpected
way
father
zossima
rose
suddenly
from
his
seat
almost
distracted
with
anxiety
for
the
elder
and
every
one
else
alyosha
succeeded
however
in
supporting
him
by
the
arm
father
zossima
moved
towards
dmitri
and
reaching
him
sank
on
his
knees
before
him
alyosha
thought
that
he
had
fallen
from
weakness
but
this
was
not
so
the
elder
distinctly
and
deliberately
bowed
down
at
dmitri
s
feet
till
his
forehead
touched
the
floor
alyosha
was
so
astounded
that
he
failed
to
assist
him
when
he
got
up
again
there
was
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
good
by
forgive
me
all
of
you
he
said
bowing
on
all
sides
to
his
guests
dmitri
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
amazement
bowing
down
to
him
what
did
it
mean
suddenly
he
cried
aloud
oh
god
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
all
the
guests
flocked
out
after
him
in
their
confusion
not
saying
good
by
or
bowing
to
their
host
only
the
monks
went
up
to
him
again
for
a
blessing
what
did
it
mean
falling
at
his
feet
like
that
was
it
symbolic
or
what
said
fyodor
pavlovitch
suddenly
quieted
and
trying
to
reopen
conversation
without
venturing
to
address
anybody
in
particular
they
were
all
passing
out
of
the
precincts
of
the
hermitage
at
the
moment
i
can
t
answer
for
a
madhouse
and
for
madmen
mi
sov
answered
at
once
ill
humoredly
but
i
will
spare
myself
your
company
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
trust
me
for
ever
where
s
that
monk
that
monk
that
is
the
monk
who
had
invited
them
to
dine
with
the
superior
did
not
keep
them
waiting
he
met
them
as
soon
as
they
came
down
the
steps
from
the
elder
s
cell
as
though
he
had
been
waiting
for
them
all
the
time
reverend
father
kindly
do
me
a
favor
convey
my
deepest
respect
to
the
father
superior
apologize
for
me
personally
mi
sov
to
his
reverence
telling
him
that
i
deeply
regret
that
owing
to
unforeseen
circumstances
i
am
unable
to
have
the
honor
of
being
present
at
his
table
greatly
as
i
should
desire
to
do
so
mi
sov
said
irritably
to
the
monk
and
that
unforeseen
circumstance
of
course
is
myself
fyodor
pavlovitch
cut
in
immediately
do

on
purpose

of
your
shuffling
i

by
the
church
calendar

what
s
happened

me
gentlemen

was
carried
away
and
upset
besides
and
indeed
i
am
ashamed
gentlemen
one
man
has
the
heart
of
alexander
of
macedon
and
another
the
heart
of
the
little
dog
fido
mine
is
that
of
the
little
dog
fido
i
am
ashamed
after
such
an
escapade
how
can
i
go
to
dinner
to
gobble
up
the
monastery
s
sauces
i
am
ashamed
i
can
t
you
must
excuse
me
the
devil
only
knows
what
if
he
deceives
us
thought
mi
sov
still
hesitating
and
watching
the
retreating
buffoon
with
distrustful
eyes
the
latter
turned
round
and
noticing
that
mi
sov
was
watching
him
waved
him
a
kiss
well
are
you
coming
to
the
superior
mi
sov
asked
ivan
abruptly
why
not
i
was
especially
invited
yesterday
unfortunately
i
feel
myself
compelled
to
go
to
this
confounded
dinner
said
mi
sov
with
the
same
irritability
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
monk
was
listening
we
ought
at
least
to
apologize
for
the
disturbance
and
explain
that
it
was
not
our
doing
what
do
you
think
yes
we
must
explain
that
it
wasn
t
our
doing
besides
father
won
t
be
there
observed
ivan
well
i
should
hope
not
confound
this
dinner
they
all
walked
on
however
the
monk
listened
in
silence
on
the
road
through
the
copse
he
made
one
observation
however
that
the
father
superior
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
and
that
they
were
more
than
half
an
hour
late
he
received
no
answer
mi
sov
looked
with
hatred
at
ivan
here
he
is
going
to
the
dinner
as
though
nothing
had
happened
he
thought
a
brazen
face
and
the
conscience
of
a
karamazov
chapter
vii
a
young
man
bent
on
a
career
alyosha
helped
father
zossima
to
his
bedroom
and
seated
him
on
his
bed
it
was
a
little
room
furnished
with
the
bare
necessities
there
was
a
narrow
iron
bedstead
with
a
strip
of
felt
for
a
mattress
in
the
corner
under
the
ikons
was
a
reading
desk
with
a
cross
and
the
gospel
lying
on
it
the
elder
sank
exhausted
on
the
bed
his
eyes
glittered
and
he
breathed
hard
he
looked
intently
at
alyosha
as
though
considering
something
go
my
dear
boy
go
porfiry
is
enough
for
me
make
haste
you
are
needed
there
go
and
wait
at
the
father
superior
s
table
let
me
stay
here
alyosha
entreated
you
are
more
needed
there
there
is
no
peace
there
you
will
wait
and
be
of
service
if
evil
spirits
rise
up
repeat
a
prayer
and
remember
my
son
the
elder
liked
to
call
him
that
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
in
the
future
when
it
is
god
s
will
to
call
me
leave
the
monastery
go
away
for
good
alyosha
started
what
is
it
this
is
not
your
place
for
the
time
i
bless
you
for
great
service
in
the
world
yours
will
be
a
long
pilgrimage
and
you
will
have
to
take
a
wife
too
you
will
have
to
bear
all
before
you
come
back
there
will
be
much
to
do
but
i
don
t
doubt
of
you
and
so
i
send
you
forth
christ
is
with
you
do
not
abandon
him
and
he
will
not
abandon
you
you
will
see
great
sorrow
and
in
that
sorrow
you
will
be
happy
this
is
my
last
message
to
you
in
sorrow
seek
happiness
work
work
unceasingly
remember
my
words
for
although
i
shall
talk
with
you
again
not
only
my
days
but
my
hours
are
numbered
alyosha
s
face
again
betrayed
strong
emotion
the
corners
of
his
mouth
quivered
what
is
it
again
father
zossima
asked
smiling
gently
the
worldly
may
follow
the
dead
with
tears
but
here
we
rejoice
over
the
father
who
is
departing
we
rejoice
and
pray
for
him
leave
me
i
must
pray
go
and
make
haste
be
near
your
brothers
and
not
near
one
only
but
near
both
father
zossima
raised
his
hand
to
bless
him
alyosha
could
make
no
protest
though
he
had
a
great
longing
to
remain
he
longed
moreover
to
ask
the
significance
of
his
bowing
to
dmitri
the
question
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
but
he
dared
not
ask
it
he
knew
that
the
elder
would
have
explained
it
unasked
if
he
had
thought
fit
but
evidently
it
was
not
his
will
that
action
had
made
a
terrible
impression
on
alyosha
he
believed
blindly
in
its
mysterious
significance
mysterious
and
perhaps
awful
as
he
hastened
out
of
the
hermitage
precincts
to
reach
the
monastery
in
time
to
serve
at
the
father
superior
s
dinner
he
felt
a
sudden
pang
at
his
heart
and
stopped
short
he
seemed
to
hear
again
father
zossima
s
words
foretelling
his
approaching
end
what
he
had
foretold
so
exactly
must
infallibly
come
to
pass
alyosha
believed
that
implicitly
but
how
could
he
be
left
without
him
how
could
he
live
without
seeing
and
hearing
him
where
should
he
go
he
had
told
him
not
to
weep
and
to
leave
the
monastery
good
god
it
was
long
since
alyosha
had
known
such
anguish
he
hurried
through
the
copse
that
divided
the
monastery
from
the
hermitage
and
unable
to
bear
the
burden
of
his
thoughts
he
gazed
at
the
ancient
pines
beside
the
path
he
had
not
far
to
go
about
five
hundred
paces
he
expected
to
meet
no
one
at
that
hour
but
at
the
first
turn
of
the
path
he
noticed
rakitin
he
was
waiting
for
some
one
are
you
waiting
for
me
asked
alyosha
overtaking
him
yes
grinned
rakitin
you
are
hurrying
to
the
father
superior
i
know
he
has
a
banquet
there
s
not
been
such
a
banquet
since
the
superior
entertained
the
bishop
and
general
pahatov
do
you
remember
i
shan
t
be
there
but
you
go
and
hand
the
sauces
tell
me
one
thing
alexey
what
does
that
vision
mean
that
s
what
i
want
to
ask
you
what
vision
that
bowing
to
your
brother
dmitri
and
didn
t
he
tap
the
ground
with
his
forehead
too
you
speak
of
father
zossima
yes
of
father
zossima
tapped
the
ground
ah
an
irreverent
expression
well
what
of
it
anyway
what
does
that
vision
mean
i
don
t
know
what
it
means
misha
i
knew
he
wouldn
t
explain
it
to
you
there
s
nothing
wonderful
about
it
of
course
only
the
usual
holy
mummery
but
there
was
an
object
in
the
performance
all
the
pious
people
in
the
town
will
talk
about
it
and
spread
the
story
through
the
province
wondering
what
it
meant
to
my
thinking
the
old
man
really
has
a
keen
nose
he
sniffed
a
crime
your
house
stinks
of
it
what
crime
rakitin
evidently
had
something
he
was
eager
to
speak
of
it
ll
be
in
your
family
this
crime
between
your
brothers
and
your
rich
old
father
so
father
zossima
flopped
down
to
be
ready
for
what
may
turn
up
if
something
happens
later
on
it
ll
be
ah
the
holy
man
foresaw
it
prophesied
it
though
it
s
a
poor
sort
of
prophecy
flopping
like
that
ah
but
it
was
symbolic
they
ll
say
an
allegory
and
the
devil
knows
what
all
it
ll
be
remembered
to
his
glory
he
predicted
the
crime
and
marked
the
criminal
that
s
always
the
way
with
these
crazy
fanatics
they
cross
themselves
at
the
tavern
and
throw
stones
at
the
temple
like
your
elder
he
takes
a
stick
to
a
just
man
and
falls
at
the
feet
of
a
murderer
what
crime
what
murderer
what
do
you
mean
alyosha
stopped
dead
rakitin
stopped
too
what
murderer
as
though
you
didn
t
know
i
ll
bet
you
ve
thought
of
it
before
that
s
interesting
too
by
the
way
listen
alyosha
you
always
speak
the
truth
though
you
re
always
between
two
stools
have
you
thought
of
it
or
not
answer
i
have
answered
alyosha
in
a
low
voice
even
rakitin
was
taken
aback
what
have
you
really
he
cried
i
i
ve
not
exactly
thought
it
muttered
alyosha
but
directly
you
began
speaking
so
strangely
i
fancied
i
had
thought
of
it
myself
you
see
and
how
well
you
expressed
it
looking
at
your
father
and
your
brother
mitya
to
day
you
thought
of
a
crime
then
i
m
not
mistaken
but
wait
wait
a
minute
alyosha
broke
in
uneasily
what
has
led
you
to
see
all
this
why
does
it
interest
you
that
s
the
first
question
two
questions
disconnected
but
natural
i
ll
deal
with
them
separately
what
led
me
to
see
it
i
shouldn
t
have
seen
it
if
i
hadn
t
suddenly
understood
your
brother
dmitri
seen
right
into
the
very
heart
of
him
all
at
once
i
caught
the
whole
man
from
one
trait
these
very
honest
but
passionate
people
have
a
line
which
mustn
t
be
crossed
if
it
were
he
d
run
at
your
father
with
a
knife
but
your
father
s
a
drunken
and
abandoned
old
sinner
who
can
never
draw
the
line
if
they
both
let
themselves
go
they
ll
both
come
to
grief
no
misha
no
if
that
s
all
you
ve
reassured
me
it
won
t
come
to
that
but
why
are
you
trembling
let
me
tell
you
he
may
be
honest
our
mitya
he
is
stupid
but
honest
but
he
s
a
sensualist
that
s
the
very
definition
and
inner
essence
of
him
it
s
your
father
has
handed
him
on
his
low
sensuality
do
you
know
i
simply
wonder
at
you
alyosha
how
you
can
have
kept
your
purity
you
re
a
karamazov
too
you
know
in
your
family
sensuality
is
carried
to
a
disease
but
now
these
three
sensualists
are
watching
one
another
with
their
knives
in
their
belts
the
three
of
them
are
knocking
their
heads
together
and
you
may
be
the
fourth
you
are
mistaken
about
that
woman
dmitri
despises
her
said
alyosha
with
a
sort
of
shudder
grushenka
no
brother
he
doesn
t
despise
her
since
he
has
openly
abandoned
his
betrothed
for
her
he
doesn
t
despise
her
there
s
something
here
my
dear
boy
that
you
don
t
understand
yet
a
man
will
fall
in
love
with
some
beauty
with
a
woman
s
body
or
even
with
a
part
of
a
woman
s
body
a
sensualist
can
understand
that
and
he
ll
abandon
his
own
children
for
her
sell
his
father
and
mother
and
his
country
russia
too
if
he
s
honest
he
ll
steal
if
he
s
humane
he
ll
murder
if
he
s
faithful
he
ll
deceive
pushkin
the
poet
of
women
s
feet
sung
of
their
feet
in
his
verse
others
don
t
sing
their
praises
but
they
can
t
look
at
their
feet
without
a
thrill
and
it
s
not
only
their
feet
contempt
s
no
help
here
brother
even
if
he
did
despise
grushenka
he
does
but
he
can
t
tear
himself
away
i
understand
that
alyosha
jerked
out
suddenly
really
well
i
dare
say
you
do
understand
since
you
blurt
it
out
at
the
first
word
said
rakitin
malignantly
that
escaped
you
unawares
and
the
confession
s
the
more
precious
so
it
s
a
familiar
subject
you
ve
thought
about
it
already
about
sensuality
i
mean
oh
you
virgin
soul
you
re
a
quiet
one
alyosha
you
re
a
saint
i
know
but
the
devil
only
knows
what
you
ve
thought
about
and
what
you
know
already
you
are
pure
but
you
ve
been
down
into
the
depths
i
ve
been
watching
you
a
long
time
you
re
a
karamazov
yourself
you
re
a
thorough
karamazov
no
doubt
birth
and
selection
have
something
to
answer
for
you
re
a
sensualist
from
your
father
a
crazy
saint
from
your
mother
why
do
you
tremble
is
it
true
then
do
you
know
grushenka
has
been
begging
me
to
bring
you
along
i
ll
pull
off
his
cassock
she
says
you
can
t
think
how
she
keeps
begging
me
to
bring
you
i
wondered
why
she
took
such
an
interest
in
you
do
you
know
she
s
an
extraordinary
woman
too
thank
her
and
say
i
m
not
coming
said
alyosha
with
a
strained
smile
finish
what
you
were
saying
misha
i
ll
tell
you
my
idea
after
there
s
nothing
to
finish
it
s
all
clear
it
s
the
same
old
tune
brother
if
even
you
are
a
sensualist
at
heart
what
of
your
brother
ivan
he
s
a
karamazov
too
what
is
at
the
root
of
all
you
karamazovs
is
that
you
re
all
sensual
grasping
and
crazy
your
brother
ivan
writes
theological
articles
in
joke
for
some
idiotic
unknown
motive
of
his
own
though
he
s
an
atheist
and
he
admits
it
s
a
fraud
himself
that
s
your
brother
ivan
he
s
trying
to
get
mitya
s
betrothed
for
himself
and
i
fancy
he
ll
succeed
too
and
what
s
more
it
s
with
mitya
s
consent
for
mitya
will
surrender
his
betrothed
to
him
to
be
rid
of
her
and
escape
to
grushenka
and
he
s
ready
to
do
that
in
spite
of
all
his
nobility
and
disinterestedness
observe
that
those
are
the
most
fatal
people
who
the
devil
can
make
you
out
he
recognizes
his
vileness
and
goes
on
with
it
let
me
tell
you
too
the
old
man
your
father
is
standing
in
mitya
s
way
now
he
has
suddenly
gone
crazy
over
grushenka
his
mouth
waters
at
the
sight
of
her
it
s
simply
on
her
account
he
made
that
scene
in
the
cell
just
now
simply
because
mi
sov
called
her
an
abandoned
creature
he
s
worse
than
a
tom
cat
in
love
at
first
she
was
only
employed
by
him
in
connection
with
his
taverns
and
in
some
other
shady
business
but
now
he
has
suddenly
realized
all
she
is
and
has
gone
wild
about
her
he
keeps
pestering
her
with
his
offers
not
honorable
ones
of
course
and
they
ll
come
into
collision
the
precious
father
and
son
on
that
path
but
grushenka
favors
neither
of
them
she
s
still
playing
with
them
and
teasing
them
both
considering
which
she
can
get
most
out
of
for
though
she
could
filch
a
lot
of
money
from
the
papa
he
wouldn
t
marry
her
and
maybe
he
ll
turn
stingy
in
the
end
and
keep
his
purse
shut
that
s
where
mitya
s
value
comes
in
he
has
no
money
but
he
s
ready
to
marry
her
yes
ready
to
marry
her
to
abandon
his
betrothed
a
rare
beauty
katerina
ivanovna
who
s
rich
and
the
daughter
of
a
colonel
and
to
marry
grushenka
who
has
been
the
mistress
of
a
dissolute
old
merchant
samsonov
a
coarse
uneducated
provincial
mayor
some
murderous
conflict
may
well
come
to
pass
from
all
this
and
that
s
what
your
brother
ivan
is
waiting
for
it
would
suit
him
down
to
the
ground
he
ll
carry
off
katerina
ivanovna
for
whom
he
is
languishing
and
pocket
her
dowry
of
sixty
thousand
that
s
very
alluring
to
start
with
for
a
man
of
no
consequence
and
a
beggar
and
take
note
he
won
t
be
wronging
mitya
but
doing
him
the
greatest
service
for
i
know
as
a
fact
that
mitya
only
last
week
when
he
was
with
some
gypsy
girls
drunk
in
a
tavern
cried
out
aloud
that
he
was
unworthy
of
his
betrothed
katya
but
that
his
brother
ivan
he
was
the
man
who
deserved
her
and
katerina
ivanovna
will
not
in
the
end
refuse
such
a
fascinating
man
as
ivan
she
s
hesitating
between
the
two
of
them
already
and
how
has
that
ivan
won
you
all
so
that
you
all
worship
him
he
is
laughing
at
you
and
enjoying
himself
at
your
expense
how
do
you
know
how
can
you
speak
so
confidently
alyosha
asked
sharply
frowning
why
do
you
ask
and
are
frightened
at
my
answer
it
shows
that
you
know
i
m
speaking
the
truth
you
don
t
like
ivan
ivan
wouldn
t
be
tempted
by
money
really
and
the
beauty
of
katerina
ivanovna
it
s
not
only
the
money
though
a
fortune
of
sixty
thousand
is
an
attraction
ivan
is
above
that
he
wouldn
t
make
up
to
any
one
for
thousands
it
is
not
money
it
s
not
comfort
ivan
is
seeking
perhaps
it
s
suffering
he
is
seeking
what
wild
dream
now
oh
you
aristocrats
ah
misha
he
has
a
stormy
spirit
his
mind
is
in
bondage
he
is
haunted
by
a
great
unsolved
doubt
he
is
one
of
those
who
don
t
want
millions
but
an
answer
to
their
questions
that
s
plagiarism
alyosha
you
re
quoting
your
elder
s
phrases
ah
ivan
has
set
you
a
problem
cried
rakitin
with
undisguised
malice
his
face
changed
and
his
lips
twitched
and
the
problem
s
a
stupid
one
it
is
no
good
guessing
it
rack
your
brains
you
ll
understand
it
his
article
is
absurd
and
ridiculous
and
did
you
hear
his
stupid
theory
just
now
if
there
s
no
immortality
of
the
soul
then
there
s
no
virtue
and
everything
is
lawful
and
by
the
way
do
you
remember
how
your
brother
mitya
cried
out
i
will
remember
an
attractive
theory
for
scoundrels
i
m
being
abusive
that
s
stupid
not
for
scoundrels
but
for
pedantic
poseurs
haunted
by
profound
unsolved
doubts
he
s
showing
off
and
what
it
all
comes
to
is
on
the
one
hand
we
cannot
but
admit
and
on
the
other
it
must
be
confessed
his
whole
theory
is
a
fraud
humanity
will
find
in
itself
the
power
to
live
for
virtue
even
without
believing
in
immortality
it
will
find
it
in
love
for
freedom
for
equality
for
fraternity
rakitin
could
hardly
restrain
himself
in
his
heat
but
suddenly
as
though
remembering
something
he
stopped
short
well
that
s
enough
he
said
with
a
still
more
crooked
smile
why
are
you
laughing
do
you
think
i
m
a
vulgar
fool
no
i
never
dreamed
of
thinking
you
a
vulgar
fool
you
are
clever
but
never
mind
i
was
silly
to
smile
i
understand
your
getting
hot
about
it
misha
i
guess
from
your
warmth
that
you
are
not
indifferent
to
katerina
ivanovna
yourself
i
ve
suspected
that
for
a
long
time
brother
that
s
why
you
don
t
like
my
brother
ivan
are
you
jealous
of
him
and
jealous
of
her
money
too
won
t
you
add
that
i
ll
say
nothing
about
money
i
am
not
going
to
insult
you
i
believe
it
since
you
say
so
but
confound
you
and
your
brother
ivan
with
you
don
t
you
understand
that
one
might
very
well
dislike
him
apart
from
katerina
ivanovna
and
why
the
devil
should
i
like
him
he
condescends
to
abuse
me
you
know
why
haven
t
i
a
right
to
abuse
him
i
never
heard
of
his
saying
anything
about
you
good
or
bad
he
doesn
t
speak
of
you
at
all
but
i
heard
that
the
day
before
yesterday
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
he
was
abusing
me
for
all
he
was
worth
you
see
what
an
interest
he
takes
in
your
humble
servant
and
which
is
the
jealous
one
after
that
brother
i
can
t
say
he
was
so
good
as
to
express
the
opinion
that
if
i
don
t
go
in
for
the
career
of
an
archimandrite
in
the
immediate
future
and
don
t
become
a
monk
i
shall
be
sure
to
go
to
petersburg
and
get
on
to
some
solid
magazine
as
a
reviewer
that
i
shall
write
for
the
next
ten
years
and
in
the
end
become
the
owner
of
the
magazine
and
bring
it
out
on
the
liberal
and
atheistic
side
with
a
socialistic
tinge
with
a
tiny
gloss
of
socialism
but
keeping
a
sharp
look
out
all
the
time
that
is
keeping
in
with
both
sides
and
hoodwinking
the
fools
according
to
your
brother
s
account
the
tinge
of
socialism
won
t
hinder
me
from
laying
by
the
proceeds
and
investing
them
under
the
guidance
of
some
jew
till
at
the
end
of
my
career
i
build
a
great
house
in
petersburg
and
move
my
publishing
offices
to
it
and
let
out
the
upper
stories
to
lodgers
he
has
even
chosen
the
place
for
it
near
the
new
stone
bridge
across
the
neva
which
they
say
is
to
be
built
in
petersburg
ah
misha
that
s
just
what
will
really
happen
every
word
of
it
cried
alyosha
unable
to
restrain
a
good
humored
smile
you
are
pleased
to
be
sarcastic
too
alexey
fyodorovitch
no
no
i
m
joking
forgive
me
i
ve
something
quite
different
in
my
mind
but
excuse
me
who
can
have
told
you
all
this
you
can
t
have
been
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
yourself
when
he
was
talking
about
you
i
wasn
t
there
but
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
and
i
heard
him
tell
it
with
my
own
ears
if
you
want
to
know
he
didn
t
tell
me
but
i
overheard
him
unintentionally
of
course
for
i
was
sitting
in
grushenka
s
bedroom
and
i
couldn
t
go
away
because
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
in
the
next
room
oh
yes
i
d
forgotten
she
was
a
relation
of
yours
a
relation
that
grushenka
a
relation
of
mine
cried
rakitin
turning
crimson
are
you
mad
you
re
out
of
your
mind
why
isn
t
she
a
relation
of
yours
i
heard
so
where
can
you
have
heard
it
you
karamazovs
brag
of
being
an
ancient
noble
family
though
your
father
used
to
run
about
playing
the
buffoon
at
other
men
s
tables
and
was
only
admitted
to
the
kitchen
as
a
favor
i
may
be
only
a
priest
s
son
and
dirt
in
the
eyes
of
noblemen
like
you
but
don
t
insult
me
so
lightly
and
wantonly
i
have
a
sense
of
honor
too
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
couldn
t
be
a
relation
of
grushenka
a
common
harlot
i
beg
you
to
understand
that
rakitin
was
intensely
irritated
forgive
me
for
goodness
sake
i
had
no
idea
besides
how
can
you
call
her
a
harlot
is
she
that
sort
of
woman
alyosha
flushed
suddenly
i
tell
you
again
i
heard
that
she
was
a
relation
of
yours
you
often
go
to
see
her
and
you
told
me
yourself
you
re
not
her
lover
i
never
dreamed
that
you
of
all
people
had
such
contempt
for
her
does
she
really
deserve
it
i
may
have
reasons
of
my
own
for
visiting
her
that
s
not
your
business
but
as
for
relationship
your
brother
or
even
your
father
is
more
likely
to
make
her
yours
than
mine
well
here
we
are
you
d
better
go
to
the
kitchen
hullo
what
s
wrong
what
is
it
are
we
late
they
can
t
have
finished
dinner
so
soon
have
the
karamazovs
been
making
trouble
again
no
doubt
they
have
here
s
your
father
and
your
brother
ivan
after
him
they
ve
broken
out
from
the
father
superior
s
and
look
father
isidor
s
shouting
out
something
after
them
from
the
steps
and
your
father
s
shouting
and
waving
his
arms
i
expect
he
s
swearing
bah
and
there
goes
mi
sov
driving
away
in
his
carriage
you
see
he
s
going
and
there
s
old
maximov
running
there
must
have
been
a
row
there
can
t
have
been
any
dinner
surely
they
ve
not
been
beating
the
father
superior
or
have
they
perhaps
been
beaten
it
would
serve
them
right
there
was
reason
for
rakitin
s
exclamations
there
had
been
a
scandalous
an
unprecedented
scene
it
had
all
come
from
the
impulse
of
a
moment
chapter
viii
the
scandalous
scene
mi
sov
as
a
man
of
breeding
and
delicacy
could
not
but
feel
some
inward
qualms
when
he
reached
the
father
superior
s
with
ivan
he
felt
ashamed
of
having
lost
his
temper
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
disdained
that
despicable
wretch
fyodor
pavlovitch
too
much
to
have
been
upset
by
him
in
father
zossima
s
cell
and
so
to
have
forgotten
himself
the
monks
were
not
to
blame
in
any
case
he
reflected
on
the
steps
and
if
they
re
decent
people
here
and
the
father
superior
i
understand
is
a
nobleman
why
not
be
friendly
and
courteous
with
them
i
won
t
argue
i
ll
fall
in
with
everything
i
ll
win
them
by
politeness
and
and
show
them
that
i
ve
nothing
to
do
with
that
sop
that
buffoon
that
pierrot
and
have
merely
been
taken
in
over
this
affair
just
as
they
have
he
determined
to
drop
his
litigation
with
the
monastery
and
relinquish
his
claims
to
the
wood
cutting
and
fishery
rights
at
once
he
was
the
more
ready
to
do
this
because
the
rights
had
become
much
less
valuable
and
he
had
indeed
the
vaguest
idea
where
the
wood
and
river
in
question
were
these
excellent
intentions
were
strengthened
when
he
entered
the
father
superior
s
dining
room
though
strictly
speaking
it
was
not
a
dining
room
for
the
father
superior
had
only
two
rooms
altogether
they
were
however
much
larger
and
more
comfortable
than
father
zossima
s
but
there
was
no
great
luxury
about
the
furnishing
of
these
rooms
either
the
furniture
was
of
mahogany
covered
with
leather
in
the
old
fashioned
style
of
1820
the
floor
was
not
even
stained
but
everything
was
shining
with
cleanliness
and
there
were
many
choice
flowers
in
the
windows
the
most
sumptuous
thing
in
the
room
at
the
moment
was
of
course
the
beautifully
decorated
table
the
cloth
was
clean
the
service
shone
there
were
three
kinds
of
well
baked
bread
two
bottles
of
wine
two
of
excellent
mead
and
a
large
glass
jug
of
kvas
both
the
latter
made
in
the
monastery
and
famous
in
the
neighborhood
there
was
no
vodka
rakitin
related
afterwards
that
there
were
five
dishes
fish
soup
made
of
sterlets
served
with
little
fish
patties
then
boiled
fish
served
in
a
special
way
then
salmon
cutlets
ice
pudding
and
compote
and
finally
blanc
mange
rakitin
found
out
about
all
these
good
things
for
he
could
not
resist
peeping
into
the
kitchen
where
he
already
had
a
footing
he
had
a
footing
everywhere
and
got
information
about
everything
he
was
of
an
uneasy
and
envious
temper
he
was
well
aware
of
his
own
considerable
abilities
and
nervously
exaggerated
them
in
his
self
conceit
he
knew
he
would
play
a
prominent
part
of
some
sort
but
alyosha
who
was
attached
to
him
was
distressed
to
see
that
his
friend
rakitin
was
dishonorable
and
quite
unconscious
of
being
so
himself
considering
on
the
contrary
that
because
he
would
not
steal
money
left
on
the
table
he
was
a
man
of
the
highest
integrity
neither
alyosha
nor
any
one
else
could
have
influenced
him
in
that
rakitin
of
course
was
a
person
of
too
little
consequence
to
be
invited
to
the
dinner
to
which
father
iosif
father
pa
ssy
and
one
other
monk
were
the
only
inmates
of
the
monastery
invited
they
were
already
waiting
when
mi
sov
kalganov
and
ivan
arrived
the
other
guest
maximov
stood
a
little
aside
waiting
also
the
father
superior
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
room
to
receive
his
guests
he
was
a
tall
thin
but
still
vigorous
old
man
with
black
hair
streaked
with
gray
and
a
long
grave
ascetic
face
he
bowed
to
his
guests
in
silence
but
this
time
they
approached
to
receive
his
blessing
mi
sov
even
tried
to
kiss
his
hand
but
the
father
superior
drew
it
back
in
time
to
avoid
the
salute
but
ivan
and
kalganov
went
through
the
ceremony
in
the
most
simple
hearted
and
complete
manner
kissing
his
hand
as
peasants
do
we
must
apologize
most
humbly
your
reverence
began
mi
sov
simpering
affably
and
speaking
in
a
dignified
and
respectful
tone
pardon
us
for
having
come
alone
without
the
gentleman
you
invited
fyodor
pavlovitch
he
felt
obliged
to
decline
the
honor
of
your
hospitality
and
not
without
reason
in
the
reverend
father
zossima
s
cell
he
was
carried
away
by
the
unhappy
dissension
with
his
son
and
let
fall
words
which
were
quite
out
of
keeping
in
fact
quite
unseemly
as
he
glanced
at
the
monks
your
reverence
is
no
doubt
already
aware
and
therefore
recognizing
that
he
had
been
to
blame
he
felt
sincere
regret
and
shame
and
begged
me
and
his
son
ivan
fyodorovitch
to
convey
to
you
his
apologies
and
regrets
in
brief
he
hopes
and
desires
to
make
amends
later
he
asks
your
blessing
and
begs
you
to
forget
what
has
taken
place
as
he
uttered
the
last
word
of
his
tirade
mi
sov
completely
recovered
his
self
complacency
and
all
traces
of
his
former
irritation
disappeared
he
fully
and
sincerely
loved
humanity
again
the
father
superior
listened
to
him
with
dignity
and
with
a
slight
bend
of
the
head
replied
i
sincerely
deplore
his
absence
perhaps
at
our
table
he
might
have
learnt
to
like
us
and
we
him
pray
be
seated
gentlemen
he
stood
before
the
holy
image
and
began
to
say
grace
aloud
all
bent
their
heads
reverently
and
maximov
clasped
his
hands
before
him
with
peculiar
fervor
it
was
at
this
moment
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
played
his
last
prank
it
must
be
noted
that
he
really
had
meant
to
go
home
and
really
had
felt
the
impossibility
of
going
to
dine
with
the
father
superior
as
though
nothing
had
happened
after
his
disgraceful
behavior
in
the
elder
s
cell
not
that
he
was
so
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
quite
the
contrary
perhaps
but
still
he
felt
it
would
be
unseemly
to
go
to
dinner
yet
his
creaking
carriage
had
hardly
been
brought
to
the
steps
of
the
hotel
and
he
had
hardly
got
into
it
when
he
suddenly
stopped
short
he
remembered
his
own
words
at
the
elder
s
i
always
feel
when
i
meet
people
that
i
am
lower
than
all
and
that
they
all
take
me
for
a
buffoon
so
i
say
let
me
play
the
buffoon
for
you
are
every
one
of
you
stupider
and
lower
than
i
he
longed
to
revenge
himself
on
every
one
for
his
own
unseemliness
he
suddenly
recalled
how
he
had
once
in
the
past
been
asked
why
do
you
hate
so
and
so
so
much
and
he
had
answered
them
with
his
shameless
impudence
i
ll
tell
you
he
has
done
me
no
harm
but
i
played
him
a
dirty
trick
and
ever
since
i
have
hated
him
remembering
that
now
he
smiled
quietly
and
malignantly
hesitating
for
a
moment
his
eyes
gleamed
and
his
lips
positively
quivered
well
since
i
have
begun
i
may
as
well
go
on
he
decided
his
predominant
sensation
at
that
moment
might
be
expressed
in
the
following
words
well
there
is
no
rehabilitating
myself
now
so
let
me
shame
them
for
all
i
am
worth
i
will
show
them
i
don
t
care
what
they
think
that
s
all
he
told
the
coachman
to
wait
while
with
rapid
steps
he
returned
to
the
monastery
and
straight
to
the
father
superior
s
he
had
no
clear
idea
what
he
would
do
but
he
knew
that
he
could
not
control
himself
and
that
a
touch
might
drive
him
to
the
utmost
limits
of
obscenity
but
only
to
obscenity
to
nothing
criminal
nothing
for
which
he
could
be
legally
punished
in
the
last
resort
he
could
always
restrain
himself
and
had
marveled
indeed
at
himself
on
that
score
sometimes
he
appeared
in
the
father
superior
s
dining
room
at
the
moment
when
the
prayer
was
over
and
all
were
moving
to
the
table
standing
in
the
doorway
he
scanned
the
company
and
laughing
his
prolonged
impudent
malicious
chuckle
looked
them
all
boldly
in
the
face
they
thought
i
had
gone
and
here
i
am
again
he
cried
to
the
whole
room
for
one
moment
every
one
stared
at
him
without
a
word
and
at
once
every
one
felt
that
something
revolting
grotesque
positively
scandalous
was
about
to
happen
mi
sov
passed
immediately
from
the
most
benevolent
frame
of
mind
to
the
most
savage
all
the
feelings
that
had
subsided
and
died
down
in
his
heart
revived
instantly
no
this
i
cannot
endure
he
cried
i
absolutely
cannot
and
i
certainly
cannot
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
he
positively
stammered
but
he
was
beyond
thinking
of
style
and
he
seized
his
hat
what
is
it
he
cannot
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
that
he
absolutely
cannot
and
certainly
cannot
your
reverence
am
i
to
come
in
or
not
will
you
receive
me
as
your
guest
you
are
welcome
with
all
my
heart
answered
the
superior
gentlemen
he
added
i
venture
to
beg
you
most
earnestly
to
lay
aside
your
dissensions
and
to
be
united
in
love
and
family
harmony
with
prayer
to
the
lord
at
our
humble
table
no
no
it
is
impossible
cried
mi
sov
beside
himself
well
if
it
is
impossible
for
pyotr
alexandrovitch
it
is
impossible
for
me
and
i
won
t
stop
that
is
why
i
came
i
will
keep
with
pyotr
alexandrovitch
everywhere
now
if
you
will
go
away
pyotr
alexandrovitch
i
will
go
away
too
if
you
remain
i
will
remain
you
stung
him
by
what
you
said
about
family
harmony
father

he
does
not
admit
he
is
my
relation
that

right

here

von

how

cried
fyodor

not
be

but
i

a
famous
murder
case
he
was
killed
in
a
house
of
harlotry
i
believe
that
is
what
such
places
are
called
among
you
he
was
killed
and
robbed
and
in
spite
of
his
venerable
age
he
was
nailed
up
in
a
box
and
sent
from
petersburg
to
moscow
in
the
luggage
van
and
while
they
were
nailing
him
up
the
harlots
sang
songs
and
played
the
harp
that
is
to
say
the
piano
so

mi

addressing
kalganov
no

fyodor
pavlovitch
broke
in
shrilly
taking
another
step
into
the
room
allow
me
to
finish
there
in
the
cell
you
blamed
me
for
behaving
disrespectfully
just
because
i
spoke
of
eating
gudgeon
pyotr

my

in
his

but
i
prefer

plus

and
damn
the
noblesse
that
s
right
isn
t
it
von
sohn
allow
me
father
superior
though
i
am
a
buffoon
and
play
the
buffoon
yet
i
am
the
soul
of
honor
and
i
want
to
speak
my
mind
yes
i
am
the
soul
of
honor
while
in
pyotr
alexandrovitch
there
is
wounded
vanity
and
nothing
else
i
came
here
perhaps
to
have
a
look
and
speak
my
mind
my
son
alexey
is
here
being
saved
i
am
his
father
i
care
for
his
welfare
and
it
is
my
duty
to
care
while
i
ve
been
playing
the
fool
i
have
been
listening
and
having
a
look
on
the
sly
and
now
i
want
to
give
you
the
last
act
of
the
performance
you
know
how
things
are
with
us
as
a
thing
falls
so
it
lies
as
a
thing
once
has
fallen
so
it
must
lie
for
ever
not
a
bit
of
it
i
want
to
get
up
again
holy
father
i
am
indignant
with
you
confession
is
a
great
sacrament
before
which
i
am
ready
to
bow
down
reverently
but
there
in
the
cell
they
all
kneel
down
and
confess
aloud
can
it
be
right
to
confess
aloud
it
was
ordained
by
the
holy
fathers
to
confess
in
secret
then
only
your
confession
will
be
a
mystery
and
so
it
was
of
old
but
how
can
i
explain
to
him
before
every
one
that
i
did
this
and
that
well
you
understand
what
sometimes
it
would
not
be
proper
to
talk
about
it
so
it
is
really
a
scandal
no
fathers
one
might
be
carried
along
with
you
to
the
flagellants
i
dare
say
at
the
first
opportunity
i
shall
write
to
the
synod
and
i
shall
take
my
son
alexey
home
we
must
note
here
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
knew
where
to
look
for
the
weak
spot
there
had
been
at
one
time
malicious
rumors
which
had
even
reached
the
archbishop
not
only
regarding
our
monastery
but
in
others
where
the
institution
of
elders
existed
that
too
much
respect
was
paid
to
the
elders
even
to
the
detriment
of
the
authority
of
the
superior
that
the
elders
abused
the
sacrament
of
confession
and
so
on
and
so
on
absurd
charges
which
had
died
away
of
themselves
everywhere
but
the
spirit
of
folly
which
had
caught
up
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
was
bearing
him
on
the
current
of
his
own
nerves
into
lower
and
lower
depths
of
ignominy
prompted
him
with
this
old
slander
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
understand
a
word
of
it
and
he
could
not
even
put
it
sensibly
for
on
this
occasion
no
one
had
been
kneeling
and
confessing
aloud
in
the
elder
s
cell
so
that
he
could
not
have
seen
anything
of
the
kind
he
was
only
speaking
from
confused
memory
of
old
slanders
but
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
his
foolish
tirade
he
felt
he
had
been
talking
absurd
nonsense
and
at
once
longed
to
prove
to
his
audience
and
above
all
to
himself
that
he
had
not
been
talking
nonsense
and
though
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
with
each
word
he
would
be
adding
more
and
more
absurdity
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
plunged
forward
blindly
how
disgraceful
cried
pyotr
alexandrovitch
pardon
me
said
the
father
superior
it
was
said
of
old
many
have
begun
to
speak
against
me
and
have
uttered
evil
sayings
about
me
and
hearing
it
i
have
said
to
myself
it
is
the
correction
of
the
lord
and
he
has
sent
it
to
heal
my
vain
soul
and
so
we
humbly
thank
you
honored
guest
and
he
made
fyodor
pavlovitch
a
low
bow
tut
tut
tut
sanctimoniousness
and
stock
phrases
old
phrases
and
old
gestures
the
old
lies
and
formal
prostrations
we
know
all
about
them
a
kiss
on
the
lips
and
a
dagger
in
the
heart
as
in
schiller
s
robbers
i
don
t
like
falsehood
fathers
i
want
the
truth
but
the
truth
is
not
to
be
found
in
eating
gudgeon
and
that
i
proclaim
aloud
father
monks
why
do
you
fast
why
do
you
expect
reward
in
heaven
for
that
why
for
reward
like
that
i
will
come
and
fast
too
no
saintly
monk
you
try
being
virtuous
in
the
world
do
good
to
society
without
shutting
yourself
up
in
a
monastery
at
other
people
s
expense
and
without
expecting
a
reward
up
aloft
for
it
you
ll
find
that
a
bit
harder
i
can
talk
sense
too
father
superior
what
have
they
got
here
he
went
up
to
the
table
old
port
wine
mead
brewed
by
the
eliseyev
brothers
fie
fie
fathers
that
is
something
beyond
gudgeon
look
at
the
bottles
the
fathers
have
brought
out
he

and
who
has
provided
it
all
the
russian
peasant
the
laborer
brings
here
the
farthing
earned
by
his
horny
hand
wringing
it
from
his
family
and
the
tax
gatherer
you
bleed
the
people
you
know
holy
fathers
this
is
too
disgraceful
said
father
iosif
father
pa
ssy
kept
obstinately
silent
mi
sov
rushed
from
the
room
and
kalganov
after
him
well
father
i
will
follow
pyotr
alexandrovitch
i
am
not
coming
to
see
you
again
you
may
beg
me
on
your
knees
i
shan
t
come
i
sent
you
a
thousand
roubles
so
you
have
begun
to
keep
your
eye
on
me
he
he
he
no
i
ll
say
no
more
i
am
taking
my
revenge
for
my
youth
for
all
the
humiliation
i
endured
he
thumped
the
table
with
his
fist
in
a
paroxysm
of
simulated
feeling
this
monastery
has
played
a
great
part
in
my
life
it
has
cost
me
many
bitter
tears
you
used
to
set
my
wife
the
crazy
one
against
me
you
cursed
me
with
bell
and
book
you
spread
stories
about
me
all
over
the
place
enough
fathers
this
is
the
age
of
liberalism
the
age
of
steamers
and
railways
neither
a
thousand
nor
a
hundred
roubles
no
nor
a
hundred
farthings
will
you
get
out
of
me
it
must
be
noted
again
that
our
monastery
never
had
played
any
great
part
in
his
life
and
he
never
had
shed
a
bitter
tear
owing
to
it
but
he
was
so
carried
away
by
his
simulated
emotion
that
he
was
for
one
moment
almost
believing
it
himself
he
was
so
touched
he
was
almost
weeping
but
at
that
very
instant
he
felt
that
it
was
time
to
draw
back
the
father
superior
bowed
his
head
at
his
malicious
lie
and
again
spoke
impressively
it
is
written
again
bear
circumspectly
and
gladly
dishonor
that
cometh
upon
thee
by
no
act
of
thine
own
be
not
confounded
and
hate
not
him
who
hath
dishonored
thee
and
so
will
we
tut
tut
tut
bethinking
thyself
and
the
rest
of
the
rigmarole
bethink
yourselves
fathers
i
will
go
but
i
will
take
my
son
alexey
away

he
went
out
shouting
and
gesticulating
it
was
at
that
moment
rakitin
saw
him
and
pointed
him
out
to
alyosha
alexey
his
father
shouted
from
far
off
catching
sight
of
him
you
come
home
to
me
to
day
for
good
and
bring
your
pillow
and
mattress
and
leave
no
trace
behind
alyosha
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
watching
the
scene
in
silence
meanwhile
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
got
into
the
carriage
and
ivan
was
about
to
follow
him
in
grim
silence
without
even
turning
to
say
good
by
to
alyosha
but
at
this
point
another
almost
incredible
scene
of
grotesque
buffoonery
gave
the
finishing
touch
to
the
episode
maximov
suddenly
appeared
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
he
ran
up
panting
afraid
of
being
too
late
rakitin
and
alyosha
saw
him
running
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
in
his
impatience
he
put
his
foot
on
the
step
on
which
ivan
s
left
foot
was
still
resting
and
clutching
the
carriage
he
kept
trying
to
jump
in
i
am
going
with
you
he
kept
shouting
laughing
a
thin
mirthful
laugh
with
a
look
of
reckless
glee
in
his
face
take
me
too
there
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
delighted
did
i
not
say
he
was
von
sohn
it
is
von
sohn
himself
risen
from
the
dead
why
how
did
you
tear
yourself
away
what
did
you

there
and
how
could
you
get
away
from
the
dinner
you
must
be
a
brazen
faced
fellow
i

that
myself
but
i
am
surprised
at
you

let
him

ivan
it
will
be
fun
he
can
lie
somewhere
at
our

at
our
feet
von
sohn
or
perch
on
the
box
with
the
coachman
skip
on
to
the
box
von
sohn
but
ivan
who
had
by
now
taken
his
seat
without
a
word
gave
maximov
a
violent
punch
in
the
breast
and
sent
him
flying
it
was
quite
by
chance
he
did
not
fall
drive
on
ivan
shouted
angrily
to
the
coachman
why
what
are
you
doing
what
are
you
about
why
did
you
do
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
protested
but
the
carriage
had
already
driven
away
ivan
made
no
reply
well
you
are
a
fellow
fyodor
pavlovitch
said
again
after
a
pause
of
two
minutes
looking
askance
at
his
son
why
it
was
you
got
up
all
this
monastery
business
you
urged
it
you
approved
of
it
why
are
you
angry
now
you
ve
talked
rot
enough
you
might
rest
a
bit
now
ivan
snapped
sullenly
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
silent
again
for
two
minutes
a
drop
of
brandy
would
be
nice
now
he
observed
sententiously
but
ivan
made
no
response
you
shall
have
some
too
when
we
get
home
ivan
was
still
silent
fyodor
pavlovitch
waited
another
two
minutes
but
i
shall
take
alyosha
away
from
the
monastery
though
you
will
dislike
it
so
much
most
honored
karl
von
moor
ivan
shrugged
his
shoulders
contemptuously
and
turning
away
stared
at
the
road
and
they
did
not
speak
again

the
way

in
the
servants
quarters
the
karamazovs
house
was
far
from
being
in
the
center
of
the
town
but
it
was
not
quite
outside
it
it
was
a
pleasant
looking
old
house
of
two
stories
painted
gray
with
a
red
iron
roof
it
was
roomy
and
snug
and
might
still
last
many
years
there
were
all
sorts
of
unexpected
little
cupboards
and
closets
and
staircases
there
were
rats
in
it
but
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
altogether
dislike
them
one
doesn
t
feel
so
solitary
when
one
s
left
alone
in
the
evening
he
used
to
say
it
was
his
habit
to
send
the
servants
away
to
the
lodge
for
the
night
and
to
lock
himself
up
alone
the
lodge
was
a
roomy
and
solid
building
in
the
yard
fyodor
pavlovitch
used
to
have
the
cooking
done
there
although
there
was
a
kitchen
in
the
house
he
did
not
like
the
smell
of
cooking
and
winter
and
summer
alike
the
dishes
were
carried
in
across
the
courtyard
the
house
was
built
for
a
large
family
there
was
room
for
five
times
as
many
with
their
servants
but
at
the
time
of
our
story
there
was
no
one
living
in
the
house
but
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
his
son
ivan
and
in
the
lodge
there
were
only
three
servants
old
grigory
and
his
old
wife
marfa
and
a
young
man
called
smerdyakov
of
these
three
we
must
say
a
few
words
of
old
grigory
we
have
said
something
already
he
was
firm
and
determined
and
went
blindly
and
obstinately
for
his
object
if
once
he
had
been
brought
by
any
reasons
and
they
were
often
very
illogical
ones
to
believe
that
it
was
immutably
right
he
was
honest
and
incorruptible
his
wife
marfa
ignatyevna
had
obeyed
her
husband
s
will
implicitly
all
her
life
yet
she
had
pestered
him
terribly
after
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
she
was
set
on
leaving
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
opening
a
little
shop
in
moscow
with
their
small
savings
but
grigory
decided
then
once
for
all
that
the
woman
s
talking
nonsense
for
every
woman
is
dishonest
and
that
they
ought
not
to
leave
their
old
master
whatever
he
might
be
for
that
was
now
their
duty
do
you
understand
what
duty
is
he
asked
marfa
ignatyevna
i
understand
what
duty
means
grigory
vassilyevitch
but
why
it
s
our
duty
to
stay
here
i
never
shall
understand
marfa
answered
firmly
well
don
t
understand
then
but
so
it
shall
be
and
you
hold
your
tongue
and
so
it
was
they
did
not
go
away
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
promised
them
a
small
sum
for
wages
and
paid
it
regularly
grigory
knew
too
that
he
had
an
indisputable
influence
over
his
master
it
was
true
and
he
was
aware
of
it
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
an
obstinate
and
cunning
buffoon
yet
though
his
will
was
strong
enough
in
some
of
the
affairs
of
life
as
he
expressed
it
he
found
himself
to
his
surprise
extremely
feeble
in
facing
certain
other
emergencies
he
knew
his
weaknesses
and
was
afraid
of
them
there
are
positions
in
which
one
has
to
keep
a
sharp
look
out
and
that
s
not
easy
without
a
trustworthy
man
and
grigory
was
a
most
trustworthy
man
many
times
in
the
course
of
his
life
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
only
just
escaped
a
sound
thrashing
through
grigory
s
intervention
and
on
each
occasion
the
old
servant
gave
him
a
good
lecture
but
it
wasn
t
only
thrashings
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
afraid
of
there
were
graver
occasions
and
very
subtle
and
complicated
ones
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
could
not
have
explained
the
extraordinary
craving
for
some
one
faithful
and
devoted
which
sometimes
unaccountably
came
upon
him
all
in
a
moment
it
was
almost
a
morbid
condition
corrupt
and
often
cruel
in
his
lust
like
some
noxious
insect
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
sometimes
in
moments
of
drunkenness
overcome
by
superstitious
terror
and
a
moral
convulsion
which
took
an
almost
physical
form
my
soul
s
simply
quaking
in
my
throat
at
those
times
he
used
to
say
at
such
moments
he
liked
to
feel
that
there
was
near
at
hand
in
the
lodge
if
not
in
the
room
a
strong
faithful
man
virtuous
and
unlike
himself
who
had
seen
all
his
debauchery
and
knew
all
his
secrets
but
was
ready
in
his
devotion
to
overlook
all
that
not
to
oppose
him
above
all
not
to
reproach
him
or
threaten
him
with
anything
either
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
and
in
case
of
need
to
defend
him
from
whom
from
somebody
unknown
but
terrible
and
dangerous
what
he
needed
was
to
feel
that
there
was
another
man
an
old
and
tried
friend
that
he
might
call
him
in
his
sick
moments
merely
to
look
at
his
face
or
perhaps
exchange
some
quite
irrelevant
words
with
him
and
if
the
old
servant
were
not
angry
he
felt
comforted
and
if
he
were
angry
he
was
more
dejected
it
happened
even
very
rarely
however
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
went
at
night
to
the
lodge
to
wake
grigory
and
fetch
him
for
a
moment
when
the
old
man
came
fyodor
pavlovitch
would
begin
talking
about
the
most
trivial
matters
and
would
soon
let
him
go
again
sometimes
even
with
a
jest
and
after
he
had
gone
fyodor
pavlovitch
would
get
into
bed
with
a
curse
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
just
something
of
the
same
sort
had
happened
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
on
alyosha
s
arrival
alyosha
pierced
his
heart
by
living
with
him
seeing
everything
and
blaming
nothing
moreover
alyosha
brought
with
him
something
his
father
had
never
known
before
a
complete
absence
of
contempt
for
him
and
an
invariable
kindness
a
perfectly
natural
unaffected
devotion
to
the
old
man
who
deserved
it
so
little
all
this
was
a
complete
surprise
to
the
old
profligate
who
had
dropped
all
family
ties
it
was
a
new
and
surprising
experience
for
him
who
had
till
then
loved
nothing
but
evil
when
alyosha
had
left
him
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
had
learnt
something
he
had
not
till
then
been
willing
to
learn
i
have
mentioned
already
that
grigory
had
detested
adela
da
ivanovna
the
first
wife
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
the
mother
of
dmitri
and
that
he
had
on
the
contrary
protected
sofya
ivanovna
the
poor
crazy
woman
against
his
master
and
any
one
who
chanced
to
speak
ill
or
lightly
of
her
his
sympathy
for
the
unhappy
wife
had
become
something
sacred
to
him
so
that
even
now
twenty
years
after
he
could
not
bear
a
slighting
allusion
to
her
from
any
one
and
would
at
once
check
the
offender
externally
grigory
was
cold
dignified
and
taciturn
and
spoke
weighing
his
words
without
frivolity
it
was
impossible
to
tell
at
first
sight
whether
he
loved
his
meek
obedient
wife
but
he
really
did
love
her
and
she
knew
it
marfa
ignatyevna
was
by
no
means
foolish
she
was
probably
indeed
cleverer
than
her
husband
or
at
least
more
prudent
than
he
in
worldly
affairs
and
yet
she
had
given
in
to
him
in
everything
without
question
or
complaint
ever
since
her
marriage
and
respected
him
for
his
spiritual
superiority
it
was
remarkable
how
little
they
spoke
to
one
another
in
the
course
of
their
lives
and
only
of
the
most
necessary
daily
affairs
the
grave
and
dignified
grigory
thought
over
all
his
cares
and
duties
alone
so
that
marfa
ignatyevna
had
long
grown
used
to
knowing
that
he
did
not
need
her
advice
she
felt
that
her
husband
respected
her
silence
and
took
it
as
a
sign
of
her
good
sense
he
had
never
beaten
her
but
once
and
then
only
slightly
once
during
the
year
after
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
marriage
with
adela
da
ivanovna
the
village
girls
and
women
at
that
time
serfs
were
called
together
before
the
house
to
sing
and
dance
they
were
beginning
in
the
green
meadows
when
marfa
at
that
time
a
young
woman
skipped
forward
and
danced
the
russian
dance
not
in
the
village
fashion
but
as
she
had
danced
it
when
she
was
a
servant
in
the
service
of
the
rich
mi
sov
family
in
their
private
theater
where
the
actors
were
taught
to
dance
by
a
dancing
master
from
moscow
grigory
saw
how
his
wife
danced
and
an
hour
later
at
home
in
their
cottage
he
gave
her
a
lesson
pulling
her
hair
a
little
but
there
it
ended
the
beating
was
never
repeated
and
marfa
ignatyevna
gave
up
dancing
god
had
not
blessed
them
with
children
one
child
was
born
but
it
died
grigory
was
fond
of
children
and
was
not
ashamed
of
showing
it
when
adela
da
ivanovna
had
run
away
grigory
took
dmitri
then
a
child
of
three
years
old
combed
his
hair
and
washed
him
in
a
tub
with
his
own
hands
and
looked
after
him
for
almost
a
year
afterwards
he
had
looked
after
ivan
and
alyosha
for
which
the
general
s
widow
had
rewarded
him
with
a
slap
in
the
face
but
i
have
already
related
all
that
the
only
happiness
his
own
child
had
brought
him
had
been
in
the
anticipation
of
its
birth
when
it
was
born
he
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
horror
the
baby
had
six
fingers
grigory
was
so
crushed
by
this
that
he
was
not
only
silent
till
the
day
of
the
christening
but
kept
away
in
the
garden
it
was
spring
and
he
spent
three
days
digging
the
kitchen
garden
the
third
day
was
fixed
for
christening
the
baby
mean
time
grigory
had
reached
a
conclusion
going
into
the
cottage
where
the
clergy
were
assembled
and
the
visitors
had
arrived
including
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
was
to
stand
god
father
he
suddenly
announced
that
the
baby
ought
not
to
be
christened
at
all
he
announced
this
quietly
briefly
forcing
out
his
words
and
gazing
with
dull
intentness
at
the
priest
why
not
asked
the
priest
with
good
humored
surprise
because
it
s
a
dragon
muttered
grigory
a
dragon
what
dragon
grigory
did
not
speak
for
some
time
it
s
a
confusion
of
nature
he
muttered
vaguely
but
firmly
and
obviously
unwilling
to
say
more
they
laughed
and
of
course
christened
the
poor
baby
grigory
prayed
earnestly
at
the
font
but
his
opinion
of
the
new
born
child
remained
unchanged
yet
he
did
not
interfere
in
any
way
as
long
as
the
sickly
infant
lived
he
scarcely
looked
at
it
tried
indeed
not
to
notice
it
and
for
the
most
part
kept
out
of
the
cottage
but
when
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
the
baby
died
of
thrush
he
himself
laid
the
child
in
its
little
coffin
looked
at
it
in
profound
grief
and
when
they
were
filling
up
the
shallow
little
grave
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
bowed
down
to
the
earth
he
did
not
for
years
afterwards
mention
his
child
nor
did
marfa
speak
of
the
baby
before
him
and
even
if
grigory
were
not
present
she
never
spoke
of
it
above
a
whisper
marfa
observed
that
from
the
day
of
the
burial
he
devoted
himself
to
religion
and
took
to
reading
the
lives
of
the
saints
for
the
most
part
sitting
alone
and
in
silence
and
always
putting
on
his
big
round
silver
rimmed
spectacles
he
rarely
read
aloud
only
perhaps
in
lent
he
was
fond
of
the
book
of
job
and
had
somehow
got
hold
of
a
copy
of
the
sayings
and
sermons
of
the
god
fearing
father
isaac
the
syrian
which
he
read
persistently
for
years
together
understanding
very
little
of
it
but
perhaps
prizing
and
loving
it
the
more
for
that
of
late
he
had
begun
to
listen
to
the
doctrines
of
the
sect
of
flagellants
settled
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
evidently
shaken
by
them
but
judged
it
unfitting
to
go
over
to
the
new
faith
his
habit
of
theological
reading
gave
him
an
expression
of
still
greater
gravity
he
was
perhaps
predisposed
to
mysticism
and
the
birth
of
his
deformed
child
and
its
death
had
as
though
by
special
design
been
accompanied
by
another
strange
and
marvelous
event
which
as
he
said
later
had
left
a
stamp
upon
his
soul
it
happened
that
on
the
very
night
after
the
burial
of
his
child
marfa
was
awakened
by
the
wail
of
a
new
born
baby
she
was
frightened
and
waked
her
husband
he
listened
and
said
he
thought
it
was
more
like
some
one
groaning
it
might
be
a
woman
he
got
up
and
dressed
it
was
a
rather
warm
night
in
may
as
he
went
down
the
steps
he
distinctly
heard
groans
coming
from
the
garden
but
the
gate
from
the
yard
into
the
garden
was
locked
at
night
and
there
was
no
other
way
of
entering
it
for
it
was
enclosed
all
round
by
a
strong
high
fence
going
back
into
the
house
grigory
lighted
a
lantern
took
the
garden
key
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
hysterical
fears
of
his
wife
who
was
still
persuaded
that
she
heard
a
child
crying
and
that
it
was
her
own
baby
crying
and
calling
for
her
went
into
the
garden
in
silence
there
he
heard
at
once
that
the
groans
came
from
the
bath
house
that
stood
near
the
garden
gate
and
that
they
were
the
groans
of
a
woman
opening
the
door
of
the
bath
house
he
saw
a
sight
which
petrified
him
an
idiot
girl
who
wandered
about
the
streets
and
was
known
to
the
whole
town
by
the
nickname
of
lizaveta
smerdyastchaya
stinking
lizaveta
had
got
into
the
bath
house
and
had
just
given
birth
to
a
child
she
lay
dying
with
the
baby
beside
her
she
said
nothing
for
she
had
never
been
able
to
speak
but
her
story
needs
a
chapter
to
itself
chapter
ii
lizaveta
there
was
one
circumstance
which
struck
grigory
particularly
and
confirmed
a
very
unpleasant
and
revolting
suspicion
this
lizaveta
was
a
dwarfish
creature
not
five
foot
within
a
wee
bit
as
many
of
the
pious
old
women
said
pathetically
about
her
after
her
death
her
broad
healthy
red
face
had
a
look
of
blank
idiocy
and
the
fixed
stare
in
her
eyes
was
unpleasant
in
spite
of
their
meek
expression
she
wandered
about
summer
and
winter
alike
barefooted
wearing
nothing
but
a
hempen
smock
her
coarse
almost
black
hair
curled
like
lamb
s
wool
and
formed
a
sort
of
huge
cap
on
her
head
it
was
always
crusted
with
mud
and
had
leaves
bits
of
stick
and
shavings
clinging
to
it
as
she
always
slept
on
the
ground
and
in
the
dirt
her
father
a
homeless
sickly
drunkard
called
ilya
had
lost
everything
and
lived
many
years
as
a
workman
with
some
well
to
do
tradespeople
her
mother
had
long
been
dead
spiteful
and
diseased
ilya
used
to
beat
lizaveta
inhumanly
whenever
she
returned
to
him
but
she
rarely
did
so
for
every
one
in
the
town
was
ready
to
look
after
her
as
being
an
idiot
and
so
specially
dear
to
god
ilya
s
employers
and
many
others
in
the
town
especially
of
the
tradespeople
tried
to
clothe
her
better
and
always
rigged
her
out
with
high
boots
and
sheepskin
coat
for
the
winter
but
although
she
allowed
them
to
dress
her
up
without
resisting
she
usually
went
away
preferably
to
the
cathedral
porch
and
taking
off
all
that
had
been
given
her
kerchief
sheepskin
skirt
or
boots
she
left
them
there
and
walked
away
barefoot
in
her
smock
as
before
it
happened
on
one
occasion
that
a
new
governor
of
the
province
making
a
tour
of
inspection
in
our
town
saw
lizaveta
and
was
wounded
in
his
tenderest
susceptibilities
and
though
he
was
told
she
was
an
idiot
he
pronounced
that
for
a
young
woman
of
twenty
to
wander
about
in
nothing
but
a
smock
was
a
breach
of
the
proprieties
and
must
not
occur
again
but
the
governor
went
his
way
and
lizaveta
was
left
as
she
was
at
last
her
father
died
which
made
her
even
more
acceptable
in
the
eyes
of
the
religious
persons
of
the
town
as
an
orphan
in
fact
every
one
seemed
to
like
her
even
the
boys
did
not
tease
her
and
the
boys
of
our
town
especially
the
schoolboys
are
a
mischievous
set
she
would
walk
into
strange
houses
and
no
one
drove
her
away
every
one
was
kind
to
her
and
gave
her
something
if
she
were
given
a
copper
she
would
take
it
and
at
once
drop
it
in
the
alms
jug
of
the
church
or
prison
if
she
were
given
a
roll
or
bun
in
the
market
she
would
hand
it
to
the
first
child
she
met
sometimes
she
would
stop
one
of
the
richest
ladies
in
the
town
and
give
it
to
her
and
the
lady
would
be
pleased
to
take
it
she
herself
never
tasted
anything
but
black
bread
and
water
if
she
went
into
an
expensive
shop
where
there
were
costly
goods
or
money
lying
about
no
one
kept
watch
on
her
for
they
knew
that
if
she
saw
thousands
of
roubles
overlooked
by
them
she
would
not
have
touched
a
farthing
she
scarcely
ever
went
to
church
she
slept
either
in
the
church
porch
or
climbed
over
a
hurdle
there
are
many
hurdles
instead
of
fences
to
this
day
in
our
town
into
a
kitchen
garden
she
used
at
least
once
a
week
to
turn
up
at
home
that
is
at
the
house
of
her
father
s
former
employers
and
in
the
winter
went
there
every
night
and
slept
either
in
the
passage
or
the
cowhouse
people
were
amazed
that
she
could
stand
such
a
life
but
she
was
accustomed
to
it
and
although
she
was
so
tiny
she
was
of
a
robust
constitution
some
of
the
townspeople
declared
that
she
did
all
this
only
from
pride
but
that
is
hardly
credible
she
could
hardly
speak
and
only
from
time
to
time
uttered
an
inarticulate
grunt
how
could
she
have
been
proud
it
happened
one
clear
warm
moonlight
night
in
september
many
years
ago
five
or
six
drunken
revelers
were
returning
from
the
club
at
a
very
late
hour
according
to
our
provincial
notions
they
passed
through
the
back
way
which
led
between
the
back
gardens
of
the
houses
with
hurdles
on
either
side
this
way
leads
out
on
to
the
bridge
over
the
long
stinking
pool
which
we
were
accustomed
to
call
a
river
among
the
nettles
and
burdocks
under
the
hurdle
our
revelers
saw
lizaveta
asleep
they
stopped
to
look
at
her
laughing
and
began
jesting
with
unbridled
licentiousness
it
occurred
to
one
young
gentleman
to
make
the
whimsical
inquiry
whether
any
one
could
possibly
look
upon
such
an
animal
as
a
woman
and
so
forth
they
all
pronounced
with
lofty
repugnance
that
it
was
impossible
but
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
was
among
them
sprang
forward
and
declared
that
it
was
by
no
means
impossible
and
that
indeed
there
was
a
certain
piquancy
about
it
and
so
on
it
is
true
that
at
that
time
he
was
overdoing
his
part
as
a
buffoon
he
liked
to
put
himself
forward
and
entertain
the
company
ostensibly
on
equal
terms
of
course
though
in
reality
he
was
on
a
servile
footing
with
them
it
was
just
at
the
time
when
he
had
received
the
news
of
his
first
wife
s
death
in
petersburg
and
with
crape
upon
his
hat
was
drinking
and
behaving
so
shamelessly
that
even
the
most
reckless
among
us
were
shocked
at
the
sight
of
him
the
revelers
of
course
laughed
at
this
unexpected
opinion
and
one
of
them
even
began
challenging
him
to
act
upon
it
the
others
repelled
the
idea
even
more
emphatically
although
still
with
the
utmost
hilarity
and
at
last
they
went
on
their
way
later
on
fyodor
pavlovitch
swore
that
he
had
gone
with
them
and
perhaps
it
was
so
no
one
knows
for
certain
and
no
one
ever
knew
but
five
or
six
months
later
all
the
town
was
talking
with
intense
and
sincere
indignation
of
lizaveta
s
condition
and
trying
to
find
out
who
was
the
miscreant
who
had
wronged
her
then
suddenly
a
terrible
rumor
was
all
over
the
town
that
this
miscreant
was
no
other
than
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
set
the
rumor
going
of
that
drunken
band
five
had
left
the
town
and
the
only
one
still
among
us
was
an
elderly
and
much
respected
civil
councilor
the
father
of
grown
up
daughters
who
could
hardly
have
spread
the
tale
even
if
there
had
been
any
foundation
for
it
but
rumor
pointed
straight
at
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
persisted
in
pointing
at
him
of
course
this
was
no
great
grievance
to
him
he
would
not
have
troubled
to
contradict
a
set
of
tradespeople
in
those
days
he
was
proud
and
did
not
condescend
to
talk
except
in
his
own
circle
of
the
officials
and
nobles
whom
he
entertained
so
well
at
the
time
grigory
stood
up
for
his
master
vigorously
he
provoked
quarrels
and
altercations
in
defense
of
him
and
succeeded
in
bringing
some
people
round
to
his
side
it
s
the
wench
s
own
fault
he
asserted
and
the
culprit
was
karp
a
dangerous
convict
who
had
escaped
from
prison
and
whose
name
was
well
known
to
us
as
he
had
hidden
in
our
town
this
conjecture
sounded
plausible
for
it
was
remembered
that
karp
had
been
in
the
neighborhood
just
at
that
time
in
the
autumn
and
had
robbed
three
people
but
this
affair
and
all
the
talk
about
it
did
not
estrange
popular
sympathy
from
the
poor
idiot
she
was
better
looked
after
than
ever
a
well
to
do
merchant
s
widow
named
kondratyev
arranged
to
take
her
into
her
house
at
the
end
of
april
meaning
not
to
let
her
go
out
until
after
the
confinement
they
kept
a
constant
watch
over
her
but
in
spite
of
their
vigilance
she
escaped
on
the
very
last
day
and
made
her
way
into
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
garden
how
in
her
condition
she
managed
to
climb
over
the
high
strong
fence
remained
a
mystery
some
maintained
that
she
must
have
been
lifted
over
by
somebody
others
hinted
at
something
more
uncanny
the
most
likely
explanation
is
that
it
happened
naturally
that
lizaveta
accustomed
to
clambering
over
hurdles
to
sleep
in
gardens
had
somehow
managed
to
climb
this
fence
in
spite
of
her
condition
and
had
leapt
down
injuring
herself
grigory
rushed
to
marfa
and
sent
her
to
lizaveta
while
he
ran
to
fetch
an
old
midwife
who
lived
close
by
they
saved
the
baby
but
lizaveta
died
at
dawn
grigory
took
the
baby
brought
it
home
and
making
his
wife
sit
down
put
it
on
her
lap
a
child
of
god
an
orphan
is
akin
to
all
he
said
and
to
us
above
others
our
little
lost
one
has
sent
us
this
who
has
come
from
the
devil
s
son
and
a
holy
innocent
nurse
him
and
weep
no
more
so
marfa
brought
up
the
child
he
was
christened
pavel
to
which
people
were
not
slow
in
adding
fyodorovitch
son
of
fyodor
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
object
to
any
of
this
and
thought
it
amusing
though
he
persisted
vigorously
in
denying
his
responsibility
the
townspeople
were
pleased
at
his
adopting
the
foundling
later
on
fyodor
pavlovitch
invented
a
surname
for
the
child
calling
him
smerdyakov
after
his
mother
s
nickname
so
this
smerdyakov
became
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
second
servant
and
was
living
in
the
lodge
with
grigory
and
marfa
at
the
time
our
story
begins
he
was
employed
as
cook
i
ought
to
say
something
of
this
smerdyakov
but
i
am
ashamed
of
keeping
my
readers
attention
so
long
occupied
with
these
common
menials
and
i
will
go
back
to
my
story
hoping
to
say
more
of
smerdyakov
in
the
course
of
it
chapter
iii
the
confession
of
a
passionate
heart
in
verse
alyosha
remained
for
some
time
irresolute
after
hearing
the
command
his
father
shouted
to
him
from
the
carriage
but
in
spite
of
his
uneasiness
he
did
not
stand
still
that
was
not
his
way
he
went
at
once
to
the
kitchen
to
find
out
what
his
father
had
been
doing
above
then
he
set
off
trusting
that
on
the
way
he
would
find
some
answer
to
the
doubt
tormenting
him
i
hasten
to
add
that
his
father
s
shouts
commanding
him
to
return
home
with
his
mattress
and
pillow
did
not
frighten
him
in
the
least
he
understood
perfectly
that
those
peremptory
shouts
were
merely
a
flourish
to
produce
an
effect
in
the
same
way
a
tradesman
in
our
town
who
was
celebrating
his
name
day
with
a
party
of
friends
getting
angry
at
being
refused
more
vodka
smashed
up
his
own
crockery
and
furniture
and
tore
his
own
and
his
wife
s
clothes
and
finally
broke
his
windows
all
for
the
sake
of
effect
next
day
of
course
when
he
was
sober
he
regretted
the
broken
cups
and
saucers
alyosha
knew
that
his
father
would
let
him
go
back
to
the
monastery
next
day
possibly
even
that
evening
moreover
he
was
fully
persuaded
that
his
father
might
hurt
any
one
else
but
would
not
hurt
him
alyosha
was
certain
that
no
one
in
the
whole
world
ever
would
want
to
hurt
him
and
what
is
more
he
knew
that
no
one
could
hurt
him
this
was
for
him
an
axiom
assumed
once
for
all
without
question
and
he
went
his
way
without
hesitation
relying
on
it
but
at
that
moment
an
anxiety
of
a
different
sort
disturbed
him
and
worried
him
the
more
because
he
could
not
formulate
it
it
was
the
fear
of
a
woman
of
katerina
ivanovna
who
had
so
urgently
entreated
him
in
the
note
handed
to
him
by
madame
hohlakov
to
come
and
see
her
about
something
this
request
and
the
necessity
of
going
had
at
once
aroused
an
uneasy
feeling
in
his
heart
and
this
feeling
had
grown
more
and
more
painful
all
the
morning
in
spite
of
the
scenes
at
the
hermitage
and
at
the
father
superior
s
he
was
not
uneasy
because
he
did
not
know
what
she
would
speak
of
and
what
he
must
answer
and
he
was
not
afraid
of
her
simply
as
a
woman
though
he
knew
little
of
women
he
had
spent
his
life
from
early
childhood
till
he
entered
the
monastery
entirely
with
women
he
was
afraid
of
that
woman
katerina
ivanovna
he
had
been
afraid
of
her
from
the
first
time
he
saw
her
he
had
only
seen
her
two
or
three
times
and
had
only
chanced
to
say
a
few
words
to
her
he
thought
of
her
as
a
beautiful
proud
imperious
girl
it
was
not
her
beauty
which
troubled
him
but
something
else
and
the
vagueness
of
his
apprehension
increased
the
apprehension
itself
the
girl
s
aims
were
of
the
noblest
he
knew
that
she
was
trying
to
save
his
brother
dmitri
simply
through
generosity
though
he
had
already
behaved
badly
to
her
yet
although
alyosha
recognized
and
did
justice
to
all
these
fine
and
generous
sentiments
a
shiver
began
to
run
down
his
back
as
soon
as
he
drew
near
her
house
he
reflected
that
he
would
not
find
ivan
who
was
so
intimate
a
friend
with
her
for
ivan
was
certainly
now
with
his
father
dmitri
he
was
even
more
certain
not
to
find
there
and
he
had
a
foreboding
of
the
reason
and
so
his
conversation
would
be
with
her
alone
he
had
a
great
longing
to
run
and
see
his
brother
dmitri
before
that
fateful
interview
without
showing
him
the
letter
he
could
talk
to
him
about
it
but
dmitri
lived
a
long
way
off
and
he
was
sure
to
be
away
from
home
too
standing
still
for
a
minute
he
reached
a
final
decision
crossing
himself
with
a
rapid
and
accustomed
gesture
and
at
once
smiling
he
turned
resolutely
in
the
direction
of
his
terrible
lady
he
knew
her
house
if
he
went
by
the
high
street
and
then
across
the
market
place
it
was
a
long
way
round
though
our
town
is
small
it
is
scattered
and
the
houses
are
far
apart
and
meanwhile
his
father
was
expecting
him
and
perhaps
had
not
yet
forgotten
his
command
he
might
be
unreasonable
and
so
he
had
to
make
haste
to
get
there
and
back
so
he
decided
to
take
a
short
cut
by
the
back
way
for
he
knew
every
inch
of
the
ground
this
meant
skirting
fences
climbing
over
hurdles
and
crossing
other
people
s
back
yards
where
every
one
he
met
knew
him
and
greeted
him
in
this
way
he
could
reach
the
high
street
in
half
the
time
he
had
to
pass
the
garden
adjoining
his
father
s
and
belonging
to
a
little
tumbledown
house
with
four
windows
the
owner
of
this
house
as
alyosha
knew
was
a
bedridden
old
woman
living
with
her
daughter
who
had
been
a
genteel
maid
servant
in
generals
families
in
petersburg
now
she
had
been
at
home
a
year
looking
after
her
sick
mother
she
always
dressed
up
in
fine
clothes
though
her
old
mother
and
she
had
sunk
into
such
poverty
that
they
went
every
day
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
kitchen
for
soup
and
bread
which
marfa
gave
readily
yet
though
the
young
woman
came
up
for
soup
she
had
never
sold
any
of
her
dresses
and
one
of
these
even
had
a
long
train
a
fact
which
alyosha
had
learned
from
rakitin
who
always
knew
everything
that
was
going
on
in
the
town
he
had
forgotten
it
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
but
now
on
reaching
the
garden
he
remembered
the
dress
with
the
train
raised
his
head
which
had
been
bowed
in
thought
and
came
upon
something
quite
unexpected
over
the
hurdle
in
the
garden
dmitri
mounted
on
something
was
leaning
forward
gesticulating
violently
beckoning
to
him
obviously
afraid
to
utter
a
word
for
fear
of
being
overheard
alyosha
ran
up
to
the
hurdle
it
s
a
good
thing
you
looked
up
i
was
nearly
shouting
to
you
mitya
said
in
a
joyful
hurried
whisper
climb
in
here
quickly
how
splendid
that
you
ve
come
i
was
just
thinking
of
you
alyosha
was
delighted
too
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
over
the
hurdle
mitya
put
his
powerful
hand
under
his
elbow
to
help
him
jump
tucking
up
his
cassock
alyosha
leapt
over
the
hurdle
with
the
agility
of
a
bare
legged
street
urchin
well
done
now
come
along
said
mitya
in
an
enthusiastic
whisper
where
whispered
alyosha
looking
about
him
and
finding
himself
in
a
deserted
garden
with
no
one
near
but
themselves
the
garden
was
small
but
the
house
was
at
least
fifty
paces
away
there
s
no
one
here
why
do
you
whisper
asked
alyosha
why
do
i
whisper
deuce
take
it
cried
dmitri
at
the
top
of
his
voice
you
see
what
silly
tricks
nature
plays
one
i
am
here
in
secret
and
on
the
watch
i
ll
explain
later
on
but
knowing
it
s
a
secret
i
began
whispering
like
a
fool
when
there
s
no
need
let
us
go
over
there
till
then
be
quiet
i
want
to
kiss
you
glory
to
god
in
the
world
glory
to
god
in
me
i
was
just
repeating
that
sitting
here
before
you
came
the
garden
was
about
three
acres
in
extent
and
planted
with
trees
only
along
the
fence
at
the
four
sides
there
were
apple
trees
maples
limes
and
birch
trees
the
middle
of
the
garden
was
an
empty
grass
space
from
which
several
hundredweight
of
hay
was
carried
in
the
summer
the
garden
was
let
out
for
a
few
roubles
for
the
summer
there
were
also
plantations
of
raspberries
and
currants
and
gooseberries
laid
out
along
the
sides
a
kitchen
garden
had
been
planted
lately
near
the
house
dmitri
led
his
brother
to
the
most
secluded
corner
of
the
garden
there
in
a
thicket
of
lime
trees
and
old
bushes
of
black
currant
elder
snowball
tree
and
lilac
there
stood
a
tumble
down
green
summer
house
blackened
with
age
its
walls
were
of
lattice
work
but
there
was
still
a
roof
which
could
give
shelter
god
knows
when
this
summer
house
was
built
there
was
a
tradition
that
it
had
been
put
up
some
fifty
years
before
by
a
retired
colonel
called
von
schmidt
who
owned
the
house
at
that
time
it
was
all
in
decay
the
floor
was
rotting
the
planks
were
loose
the
woodwork
smelled
musty
in
the
summer
house
there
was
a
green
wooden
table
fixed
in
the
ground
and
round
it
were
some
green
benches
upon
which
it
was
still
possible
to
sit
alyosha
had
at
once
observed
his
brother
s
exhilarated
condition
and
on
entering
the
arbor
he
saw
half
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
a
wineglass
on
the
table
that
s
brandy
mitya
laughed
i
see
your
look
he
s
drinking
again
distrust
the
apparition
distrust
the
worthless
lying
crowd
and
lay
aside
thy
doubts
i
m
not
drinking
i
m
only
indulging
as
that
pig
your
rakitin
says
he
ll
be
a
civil
councilor
one
day
but
he
ll
always
talk
about
indulging
sit
down
i
could
take
you
in
my
arms
alyosha
and
press
you
to
my
bosom
till
i
crush
you
for
in
the
whole
world
in
reality
in
re
al
i
ty
can
you
take
it
in
i
love
no
one
but
you
he
uttered
the
last
words
in
a
sort
of
exaltation
no
one
but
you
and
one
jade
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
to
my
ruin
but
being
in
love
doesn
t
mean
loving
you
may
be
in
love
with
a
woman
and
yet
hate
her
remember
that
i
can
talk
about
it
gayly
still
sit
down
here
by
the
table
and
i
ll
sit
beside
you
and
look
at
you
and
go
on
talking
you
shall
keep
quiet
and
i
ll
go
on
talking
for
the
time
has
come
but
on
reflection
you
know
i
d
better
speak
quietly
for
here
here
you
can
never
tell
what
ears
are
listening
i
will
explain
everything

story

be
continued
why

i
been
longing
for
you

i
been
thirsting
for
you
all
these
days
and
just
now
it

five
days
since

anchor
here
because

you
ever
dreamt
of
falling
down
a
precipice
into
a
pit
that

just
how
i
m
falling
but
not
in
a
dream
and
i
m
not
afraid
and
don
t
you

least
i
am
afraid
but
i
enjoy
it
it
s
not
enjoyment
though
but
ecstasy
damn

all
whatever
it
is
a
strong
spirit
a
weak
spirit
a
womanish
spirit

it
is
let

what
sunshine
how
clear
the
sky

o

i
waiting

cranny
of
my
soul

an
angel

alyosha
with

distressed
expression

it
all
at
once
but
be
quiet

quiet
for
a
time

t
be
sorry

dmitri
stood
up
thought
a
moment
and
put
his
finger
to
his
forehead
she
s
asked
you
written
to
you
a
letter
or
something
that
s
why
you
re
going
to
her
you
wouldn
t
be
going
except
for
that
here
is
her
note
alyosha
took
it
out
of
his
pocket
mitya
looked
through
it
quickly
and
you
were
going
the
back
way
oh
gods
i
thank
you
for
sending
him
by
the
back
way
and
he
came
to
me
like
the
golden
fish
to
the
silly
old
fishermen
in
the
fable
listen
alyosha
listen
brother
now
i
mean
to
tell
you
everything
for
i
must
tell
some
one
an
angel
in
heaven
i
ve
told
already
but
i
want
to
tell
an
angel
on
earth
you
are
an
angel
on
earth
you
will
hear
and
judge
and
forgive
and
that
s
what
i
need
that
some
one
above
me
should
forgive
listen
if
two
people
break
away
from
everything
on
earth
and
fly
off
into
the
unknown
or
at
least
one
of
them
and
before
flying
off
or
going
to
ruin
he
comes
to
some
one
else
and
says
do
this
for
me
some
favor
never
asked
before
that
could
only
be
asked
on
one
s
deathbed
would
that
other
refuse
if
he
were
a
friend
or
a
brother
i
will
do
it
but
tell
me
what
it
is
and
make
haste
said
alyosha
make
haste
h
m
don
t
be
in
a
hurry
alyosha
you
hurry
and
worry
yourself
there
s
no
need
to
hurry
now
now
the
world
has
taken
a
new
turning
ah
alyosha
what
a
pity
you
can
t
understand
ecstasy
but
what
am
i
saying
to
him
as
though
you
didn
t
understand
it
what
an
ass
i
am
what
am
i
saying
be
noble
o
man
who
says
that
alyosha
made
up
his
mind
to
wait
he
felt
that
perhaps
indeed
his
work
lay
here
mitya
sank
into
thought
for
a
moment
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hand
both
were
silent
alyosha
said
mitya
you
re
the
only
one
who
won
t
laugh
i
should
like
to
begin
my
confession
with
schiller
s
hymn
to
joy
an
die
freude
i
don
t
know
german
i
only
know
it
s
called
that
don
t
think
i
m
talking
nonsense
because
i
m
drunk
i
m
not
a
bit
drunk
brandy
s
all
very
well
but
i
need
two
bottles
to
make
me
drunk
silenus
with
his
rosy
phiz
upon
his
stumbling
ass
but
i
ve
not
drunk
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
and
i
m
not
silenus
i
m
not
silenus
though
i
am
strong
1
for
i
ve
made
a
decision
once
for
all
forgive
me
the
pun
you
ll
have
to
forgive
me
a
lot
more
than
puns
to
day
don
t
be
uneasy
i
m
not
spinning
it
out
i
m
talking
sense
and
i
ll
come
to
the
point
in
a
minute
i
won
t
keep
you
in
suspense
stay
how
does
it
go
he
raised
his
head
thought
a
minute
and
began
with
enthusiasm
wild
and
fearful
in
his
cavern
hid
the
naked
troglodyte
and
the
homeless
nomad
wandered
laying
waste
the
fertile
plain
menacing
with
spear
and
arrow
in
the
woods
the
hunter
strayed
woe
to
all
poor
wretches
stranded
on
those
cruel
and
hostile
shores
from
the
peak
of
high
olympus
came
the
mother
ceres
down
seeking
in
those
savage
regions
her
lost
daughter
proserpine
but
the
goddess
found
no
refuge
found
no
kindly
welcome
there
and
no
temple
bearing
witness
to
the
worship
of
the
gods
from
the
fields
and
from
the
vineyards
came
no
fruits
to
deck
the
feasts
only
flesh
of
bloodstained
victims
smoldered
on
the
altar
fires
and
where
er
the
grieving
goddess
turns
her
melancholy
gaze
sunk
in
vilest
degradation
man
his
loathsomeness
displays
mitya
broke
into
sobs
and
seized
alyosha
s
hand
my
dear
my
dear
in
degradation
in
degradation
now
too
there
s
a
terrible
amount
of
suffering
for
man
on
earth
a
terrible
lot
of
trouble
don
t
think
i
m
only
a
brute
in
an
officer
s
uniform
wallowing
in
dirt
and
drink
i
hardly
think
of
anything
but
of
that
degraded
man
if
only
i
m
not
lying
i
pray
god
i
m
not
lying
and
showing
off
i
think
about
that
man
because
i
am
that
man
myself
would
he
purge
his
soul
from
vileness
and
attain
to
light
and
worth
he
must
turn
and
cling
for
ever
to
his
ancient
mother
earth
but
the
difficulty
is
how
am
i
to
cling
for
ever
to
mother
earth
i
don
t
kiss
her
i
don
t
cleave
to
her
bosom
am
i
to
become
a
peasant
or
a
shepherd
i
go
on
and
i
don
t
know
whether
i
m
going
to
shame
or
to
light
and
joy
that
s
the
trouble
for
everything
in
the
world
is
a
riddle
and
whenever
i
ve
happened
to
sink
into
the
vilest
degradation
and
it
s
always
been
happening
i
always
read
that
poem
about
ceres
and
man
has
it
reformed
me
never
for
i
m
a
karamazov
for
when
i
do
leap
into
the
pit
i
go
headlong
with
my
heels
up
and
am
pleased
to
be
falling
in
that
degrading
attitude
and
pride
myself
upon
it
and
in
the
very
depths
of
that
degradation
i
begin
a
hymn
of
praise
let
me
be
accursed
let
me
be
vile
and
base
only
let
me
kiss
the
hem
of
the
veil
in
which
my
god
is
shrouded
though
i
may
be
following
the
devil
i
am
thy
son
o
lord
and
i
love
thee
and
i
feel
the
joy
without
which
the
world
cannot
stand
joy
everlasting
fostereth
the
soul
of
all
creation
it
is
her
secret
ferment
fires
the
cup
of
life
with
flame
tis
at
her
beck
the
grass
hath
turned
each
blade
towards
the
light
and
solar
systems
have
evolved
from
chaos
and
dark
night
filling
the
realms
of
boundless
space
beyond
the
sage
s
sight
at
bounteous
nature
s
kindly
breast
all
things
that
breathe
drink
joy
and
birds
and
beasts
and
creeping
things
all
follow
where
she
leads
her
gifts
to
man
are
friends
in
need
the
wreath
the
foaming
must
to
angels
vision
of
god
s
throne
to
insects
sensual
lust
but
enough
poetry
i
am
in
tears
let
me
cry
it
may
be
foolishness
that
every
one
would
laugh
at
but
you
won
t
laugh
your
eyes
are
shining
too
enough
poetry
i
want
to
tell
you
now
about
the
insects
to
whom
god
gave
sensual
lust
to
insects
sensual
lust
i
am
that
insect
brother
and
it
is
said
of
me
specially
all
we
karamazovs
are
such
insects
and
angel
as
you
are
that
insect
lives
in
you
too
and
will
stir
up
a
tempest
in
your
blood
tempests
because
sensual
lust
is
a
tempest
worse
than
a
tempest
beauty
is
a
terrible
and
awful
thing
it
is
terrible
because
it
has
not
been
fathomed
and
never
can
be
fathomed
for
god
sets
us
nothing
but
riddles
here
the
boundaries
meet
and
all
contradictions
exist
side
by
side
i
am
not
a
cultivated
man
brother
but
i
ve
thought
a
lot
about
this
it
s
terrible
what
mysteries
there
are
too
many
riddles
weigh
men
down
on
earth
we
must
solve
them
as
we
can
and
try
to
keep
a
dry
skin
in
the
water
beauty
i
can
t
endure
the
thought
that
a
man
of
lofty
mind
and
heart
begins
with
the
ideal
of
the
madonna
and
ends
with
the
ideal
of
sodom
what
s
still
more
awful
is
that
a
man
with
the
ideal
of
sodom
in
his
soul
does
not
renounce
the
ideal
of
the
madonna
and
his
heart
may
be
on
fire
with
that
ideal
genuinely
on
fire
just
as
in
his
days
of
youth
and
innocence
yes
man
is
broad
too
broad
indeed
i
d
have
him
narrower
the
devil
only
knows
what
to
make
of
it
what
to
the
mind
is
shameful
is
beauty
and
nothing
else
to
the
heart
is
there
beauty
in
sodom
believe
me
that
for
the
immense
mass
of
mankind
beauty
is
found
in
sodom
did
you
know
that
secret
the
awful
thing
is
that
beauty
is
mysterious
as
well
as
terrible
god
and
the
devil
are
fighting
there
and
the
battlefield
is
the
heart
of
man
but
a
man
always
talks
of
his
own
ache
listen
now
to
come
to
facts
chapter
iv
the
confession
of
a
passionate
heart
in
anecdote
i
was
leading
a
wild
life
then
father
said
just
now
that
i
spent
several
thousand
roubles
in
seducing
young
girls
that
s
a
swinish
invention
and
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
and
if
there
was
i
didn
t
need
money
simply
for
that
with
me
money
is
an
accessory
the
overflow
of
my
heart
the
framework
to
day
she
would
be
my
lady
to
morrow
a
wench
out
of
the
streets
in
her
place
i
entertained
them
both
i
threw
away
money
by
the
handful
on
music
rioting
and
gypsies
sometimes
i
gave
it
to
the
ladies
too
for
they
ll
take
it
greedily
that
must
be
admitted
and
be
pleased
and
thankful
for
it
ladies
used
to
be
fond
of
me
not
all
of
them
but
it
happened
it
happened
but
i
always
liked
side
paths
little
dark
back
alleys
behind
the
main
road
there
one
finds
adventures
and
surprises
and
precious
metal
in
the
dirt
i
am
speaking
figuratively
brother
in
the
town
i
was
in
there
were
no
such
back
alleys
in
the
literal
sense
but
morally
there
were
if
you
were
like
me
you
d
know
what
that
means
i
loved
vice
i
loved
the
ignominy
of
vice
i
loved
cruelty
am
i
not
a
bug
am
i
not
a
noxious
insect
in
fact
a
karamazov
once
we
went
a
whole
lot
of
us
for
a
picnic
in
seven
sledges
it
was
dark
it
was
winter
and
i
began
squeezing
a
girl
s
hand
and
forced
her
to
kiss
me
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
official
a
sweet
gentle
submissive
creature
she
allowed
me
she
allowed
me
much
in
the
dark
she
thought
poor
thing
that
i
should
come
next
day
to
make
her
an
offer
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
good
match
too
but
i
didn
t
say
a
word
to
her
for
five
months
i
used
to
see
her
in
a
corner
at
dances
we
were
always
having
dances
her
eyes
watching
me
i
saw
how
they
glowed
with
fire
a
fire
of
gentle
indignation
this
game
only
tickled
that
insect
lust
i
cherished
in
my
soul
five
months
later
she
married
an
official
and
left
the
town
still
angry
and
still
perhaps
in
love
with
me
now
they
live
happily
observe
that
i
told
no
one
i
didn
t
boast
of
it
though
i
m
full
of
low
desires
and
love
what
s
low
i
m
not
dishonorable
you
re
blushing
your
eyes
flashed
enough
of
this
filth
with
you
and
all
this
was
nothing
much
wayside
blossoms
la
paul
de
kock
though
the
cruel
insect
had
already
grown
strong
in
my
soul
i
ve
a
perfect
album
of
reminiscences
brother
god
bless
them
the
darlings
i
tried
to
break
it
off
without
quarreling
and
i
never
gave
them
away
i
never
bragged
of
one
of
them
but
that
s
enough
you
can
t
suppose
i
brought
you
here
simply
to
talk
of
such
nonsense
no
i
m
going
to
tell
you
something
more
curious
and
don
t
be
surprised
that
i
m
glad
to
tell
you
instead
of
being
ashamed
you
say
that
because
i
blushed
alyosha
said
suddenly
i
wasn
t
blushing
at
what
you
were
saying
or
at
what
you
ve
done
i
blushed
because
i
am
the
same
as
you
are
you
come
that
s
going
a
little
too
far
no
it
s
not
too
far
said
alyosha
warmly
obviously
the
idea
was
not
a
new
one
the
ladder
s
the
same
i
m
at
the
bottom
step
and
you
re
above
somewhere
about
the
thirteenth
that
s
how
i
see
it
but
it
s
all
the
same
absolutely
the
same
in
kind
any
one
on
the
bottom
step
is
bound
to
go
up
to
the
top
one
then
one
ought
not
to
step
on
at
all
any
one
who
can
help
it
had
better
not
but
can
you
i
think
not
hush
alyosha
hush
darling
i
could
kiss
your
hand
you
touch
me
so
that
rogue
grushenka
has
an
eye
for
men
she
told
me
once
that
she
d
devour
you
one
day
there
there
i
won
t
from
this
field
of
corruption
fouled
by
flies
let
s
pass
to
my
tragedy
also
befouled
by
flies
that
is
by
every
sort
of
vileness
although
the
old
man
told
lies
about
my
seducing
innocence
there
really
was
something
of
the
sort
in
my
tragedy
though
it
was
only
once
and
then
it
did
not
come
off
the
old
man
who
has
reproached
me
with
what
never
happened
does
not
even
know
of
this
fact
i
never
told
any
one
about
it
you
re
the
first
except
ivan
of
course
ivan
knows
everything
he
knew
about
it
long
before
you
but
ivan
s
a
tomb
ivan
s
a
tomb
yes
alyosha
listened
with
great
attention
i
was
lieutenant
in
a
line
regiment
but
still
i
was
under
supervision
like
a
kind
of
convict
yet
i
was
awfully
well
received
in
the
little
town
i
spent
money
right
and
left
i
was
thought
to
be
rich
i
thought
so
myself
but
i
must
have
pleased
them
in
other
ways
as
well
although
they
shook
their
heads
over
me
they
liked
me
my
colonel
who
was
an
old
man
took
a
sudden
dislike
to
me
he
was
always
down
upon
me
but
i
had
powerful
friends
and
moreover
all
the
town
was
on
my
side
so
he
couldn
t
do
me
much
harm
i
was
in
fault
myself
for
refusing
to
treat
him
with
proper
respect
i
was
proud
this
obstinate
old
fellow
who
was
really
a
very
good
sort
kind
hearted
and
hospitable
had
had
two
wives
both
dead
his
first
wife
who
was
of
a
humble
family
left
a
daughter
as
unpretentious
as
herself
she
was
a
young
woman
of
four
and
twenty
when
i
was
there
and
was
living
with
her
father
and
an
aunt
her
mother
s
sister
the
aunt
was
simple
and
illiterate
the
niece
was
simple
but
lively
i
like
to
say
nice
things
about
people
i
never
knew
a
woman
of
more
charming
character
than
agafya
fancy
her
name
was
agafya
ivanovna
and
she
wasn
t
bad
looking
either
in
the
russian
style
tall
stout
with
a
full
figure
and
beautiful
eyes
though
a
rather
coarse
face
she
had
not
married
although
she
had
had
two
suitors
she
refused
them
but
was
as
cheerful
as
ever
i
was
intimate
with
her
not
in
that
way
it
was
pure
friendship
i
have
often
been
friendly
with
women
quite
innocently
i
used
to
talk
to
her
with
shocking
frankness
and
she
only
laughed
many
women
like
such
freedom
and
she
was
a
girl
too
which
made
it
very
amusing
another
thing
one
could
never
think
of
her
as
a
young
lady
she
and
her
aunt
lived
in
her
father
s
house
with
a
sort
of
voluntary
humility
not
putting
themselves
on
an
equality
with
other
people
she
was
a
general
favorite
and
of
use
to
every
one
for
she
was
a
clever
dressmaker
she
had
a
talent
for
it
she
gave
her
services
freely
without
asking
for
payment
but
if
any
one
offered
her
payment
she
didn
t
refuse
the
colonel
of
course
was
a
very
different
matter
he
was
one
of
the
chief
personages
in
the
district
he
kept
open
house
entertained
the
whole
town
gave
suppers
and
dances
at
the
time
i
arrived
and
joined
the
battalion
all
the
town
was
talking
of
the
expected
return
of
the
colonel
s
second
daughter
a
great
beauty
who
had
just
left
a
fashionable
school
in
the
capital
this
second
daughter
is
katerina
ivanovna
and
she
was
the
child
of
the
second
wife
who
belonged
to
a
distinguished
general
s
family
although
as
i
learnt
on
good
authority
she
too
brought
the
colonel
no
money
she
had
connections
and
that
was
all
there
may
have
been
expectations
but
they
had
come
to
nothing
yet
when
the
young
lady
came
from
boarding
school
on
a
visit
the
whole
town
revived
our
most
distinguished
ladies
two
excellencies
and
a
colonel
s
wife
and
all
the
rest
following
their
lead
at
once
took
her
up
and
gave
entertainments
in
her
honor
she
was
the
belle
of
the
balls
and
picnics
and
they
got
up
tableaux
vivants
in
aid
of
distressed
governesses
i
took
no
notice
i
went
on
as
wildly
as
before
and
one
of
my
exploits
at
the
time
set
all
the
town
talking
i
saw
her
eyes
taking
my
measure
one
evening
at
the
battery
commander
s
but
i
didn
t
go
up
to
her
as
though
i
disdained
her
acquaintance
i
did
go
up
and
speak
to
her
at
an
evening
party
not
long
after
she
scarcely
looked
at
me
and
compressed
her
lips
scornfully
wait
a
bit
i
ll
have
my
revenge
thought
i
i
behaved
like
an
awful
fool
on
many
occasions
at
that
time
and
i
was
conscious
of
it
myself
what
made
it
worse
was
that
i
felt
that
katenka
was
not
an
innocent
boarding
school
miss
but
a
person
of
character
proud
and
really
high
principled
above
all
she
had
education
and
intellect
and
i
had
neither
you
think
i
meant
to
make
her
an
offer
no
i
simply
wanted
to
revenge
myself
because
i
was
such
a
hero
and
she
didn
t
seem
to
feel
it
meanwhile
i
spent
my
time
in
drink
and
riot
till
the
lieutenant
colonel
put
me
under
arrest
for
three
days
just
at
that
time
father
sent
me
six
thousand
roubles
in
return
for
my
sending
him
a
deed
giving
up
all
claims
upon
him
settling
our
accounts
so
to
speak
and
saying
that
i
wouldn
t
expect
anything
more
i
didn
t
understand
a
word
of
it
at
the
time
until
i
came
here
alyosha
till
the
last
few
days
indeed
perhaps
even
now
i
haven
t
been
able
to
make
head
or
tail
of
my
money
affairs
with
father
but
never
mind
that
we
ll
talk
of
it
later
just
as
i
received
the
money
i
got
a
letter
from
a
friend
telling
me
something
that
interested
me
immensely
the
authorities
i
learnt
were
dissatisfied
with
our
lieutenant
colonel
he
was
suspected
of
irregularities
in
fact
his
enemies
were
preparing
a
surprise
for
him
and
then
the
commander
of
the
division
arrived
and
kicked
up
the
devil
of
a
shindy
shortly
afterwards
he
was
ordered
to
retire
i
won
t
tell
you
how
it
all
happened
he
had
enemies
certainly
suddenly
there
was
a
marked
coolness
in
the
town
towards
him
and
all
his
family
his
friends
all
turned
their
backs
on
him
then
i
took
my
first
step
i
met
agafya
ivanovna
with
whom
i
d
always
kept
up
a
friendship
and
said
do
you
know
there
s
a
deficit
of
4
500
roubles
of
government
money
in
your
father
s
accounts
what
do
you
mean
what
makes
you
say
so
the
general
was
here
not
long
ago
and
everything
was
all
right
then
it
was
but
now
it
isn
t
she
was
terribly
scared
don
t
frighten
me
she
said
who
told
you
so
don
t
be
uneasy
i
said
i
won
t
tell
any
one
you
know
i
m
as
silent
as
the
tomb
i
only
wanted
in
view
of
possibilities
to
add
that
when
they
demand
that
4
500
roubles
from
your
father
and
he
can
t
produce
it
he
ll
be
tried
and
made
to
serve
as
a
common
soldier
in
his
old
age
unless
you
like
to
send
me
your
young
lady
secretly
i
ve
just
had
money
paid
me
i
ll
give
her
four
thousand
if
you
like
and
keep
the
secret
religiously
ah
you
scoundrel
that
s
what
she
said
you
wicked
scoundrel
how
dare
you
she
went
away
furiously
indignant
while
i
shouted
after
her
once
more
that
the
secret
should
be
kept
sacred
those
two
simple
creatures
agafya
and
her
aunt
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
behaved
like
perfect
angels
all
through
this
business
they
genuinely
adored
their
katya
thought
her
far
above
them
and
waited
on
her
hand
and
foot
but
agafya
told
her
of
our
conversation
i
found
that
out
afterwards
she
didn
t
keep
it
back
and
of
course
that
was
all
i
wanted
suddenly
the
new
major
arrived
to
take
command
of
the
battalion
the
old
lieutenant
colonel
was
taken
ill
at
once
couldn
t
leave
his
room
for
two
days
and
didn
t
hand
over
the
government
money
dr
kravchenko
declared
that
he
really
was
ill
but
i
knew
for
a
fact
and
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
for
the
last
four
years
the
money
had
never
been
in
his
hands
except
when
the
commander
made
his
visits
of
inspection
he
used
to
lend
it
to
a
trustworthy
person
a
merchant
of
our
town
called
trifonov
an
old
widower
with
a
big
beard
and
gold
rimmed
spectacles
he
used
to
go
to
the
fair
do
a
profitable
business
with
the
money
and
return
the
whole
sum
to
the
colonel
bringing
with
it
a
present
from
the
fair
as
well
as
interest
on
the
loan
but
this
time
i
heard
all
about
it
quite
by
chance
from
trifonov
s
son
and
heir
a
driveling
youth
and
one
of
the
most
vicious
in
the
world
this
time
i
say
trifonov
brought
nothing
back
from
the
fair
the
lieutenant
colonel
flew
to
him
i
ve
never
received
any
money
from
you
and
couldn
t
possibly
have
received
any
that
was
all
the
answer
he
got
so
now
our
lieutenant
colonel
is
confined
to
the
house
with
a
towel
round
his
head
while
they
re
all
three
busy
putting
ice
on
it
all
at
once
an
orderly
arrives
on
the
scene
with
the
book
and
the
order
to
hand
over
the
battalion
money
immediately
within
two
hours
he
signed
the
book
i
saw
the
signature
in
the
book
afterwards
stood
up
saying
he
would
put
on
his
uniform
ran
to
his
bedroom
loaded
his
double
barreled
gun
with
a
service
bullet
took
the
boot
off
his
right
foot
fixed
the
gun
against
his
chest
and
began
feeling
for
the
trigger
with
his
foot
but
agafya
remembering
what
i
had
told
her
had
her
suspicions
she
stole
up
and
peeped
into
the
room
just
in
time
she
rushed
in
flung
herself
upon
him
from
behind
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
the
gun
went
off
hit
the
ceiling
but
hurt
no
one
the
others
ran
in
took
away
the
gun
and
held
him
by
the
arms
i
heard
all
about
this
afterwards
i
was
at
home
it
was
getting
dusk
and
i
was
just
preparing
to
go
out
i
had
dressed
brushed
my
hair
scented
my
handkerchief
and
taken
up
my
cap
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
facing
me
in
the
room
stood
katerina
ivanovna
it
s
strange
how
things
happen
sometimes
no
one
had
seen
her
in
the
street
so
that
no
one
knew
of
it
in
the
town
i
lodged
with
two
decrepit
old
ladies
who
looked
after
me
they
were
most
obliging
old
things
ready
to
do
anything
for
me
and
at
my
request
were
as
silent
afterwards
as
two
cast
iron
posts
of
course
i
grasped
the
position
at
once
she
walked
in
and
looked
straight
at
me
her
dark
eyes
determined
even
defiant
but
on
her
lips
and
round
her
mouth
i
saw
uncertainty
my
sister
told
me
she
began
that
you
would
give
me
4
500
roubles
if
i
came
to
you
for
it
myself
i
have
come
give
me
the
money
she
couldn
t
keep
it
up
she
was
breathless
frightened
her
voice
failed
her
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
the
lines
round
it
quivered
alyosha
are
you
listening
or
are
you
asleep
mitya
i
know
you
will
tell
the
whole
truth
said
alyosha
in
agitation
i
am
telling
it
if
i
tell
the
whole
truth
just
as
it
happened
i
shan
t
spare
myself
my
first
idea
was
a
karamazov
one
once
i
was
bitten
by
a
centipede
brother
and
laid
up
a
fortnight
with
fever
from
it
well
i
felt
a
centipede
biting
at
my
heart
then
a
noxious
insect
you
understand
i
looked
her
up
and
down
you
ve
seen
her
she
s
a
beauty
but
she
was
beautiful
in
another
way
then
at
that
moment
she
was
beautiful
because
she
was
noble
and
i
was
a
scoundrel
she
in
all
the
grandeur
of
her
generosity
and
sacrifice
for
her
father
and
i
a
bug
and
scoundrel
as
i
was
she
was
altogether
at
my
mercy
body
and
soul
she
was
hemmed
in
i
tell
you
frankly
that
thought
that
venomous
thought
so
possessed
my
heart
that
it
almost
swooned
with
suspense
it
seemed
as
if
there
could
be
no
resisting
it
as
though
i
should
act
like
a
bug
like
a
venomous
spider
without
a
spark
of
pity
i
could
scarcely
breathe
understand
i
should
have
gone
next
day
to
ask
for
her
hand
so
that
it
might
end
honorably
so
to
speak
and
that
nobody
would
or
could
know
for
though
i
m
a
man
of
base
desires
i
m
honest
and
at
that
very
second
some
voice
seemed
to
whisper
in
my
ear
but
when
you
come
to
morrow
to
make
your
proposal
that
girl
won
t
even
see
you
she
ll
order
her
coachman
to
kick
you
out
of
the
yard
publish
it
through
all
the
town
she
would
say
i
m
not
afraid
of
you
i
looked
at
the
young
lady
my
voice
had
not
deceived
me
that
is
how
it
would
be
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
could
see
from
her
face
now
that
i
should
be
turned
out
of
the
house
my
spite
was
roused
i
longed
to
play
her
the
nastiest
swinish
cad
s
trick
to
look
at
her
with
a
sneer
and
on
the
spot
where
she
stood
before
me
to
stun
her
with
a
tone
of
voice
that
only
a
shopman
could
use
four
thousand
what
do
you
mean
i
was
joking
you
ve
been
counting
your
chickens
too
easily
madam
two
hundred
if
you
like
with
all
my
heart
but
four
thousand
is
not
a
sum
to
throw
away
on
such
frivolity
you
ve
put
yourself
out
to
no
purpose
i
should
have
lost
the
game
of
course
she
d
have
run
away
but
it
would
have
been
an
infernal
revenge
it
would
have
been
worth
it
all
i
d
have
howled
with
regret
all
the
rest
of
my
life
only
to
have
played
that
trick
would
you
believe
it
it
has
never
happened
to
me
with
any
other
woman
not
one
to
look
at
her
at
such
a
moment
with
hatred
but
on
my
oath
i
looked
at
her
for
three
seconds
or
five
perhaps
with
fearful
hatred
that
hate
which
is
only
a
hair
s
breadth
from
love
from
the
maddest
love
i
went
to
the
window
put
my
forehead
against
the
frozen
pane
and
i
remember
the
ice
burnt
my
forehead
like
fire
i
did
not
keep
her
long
don
t
be
afraid
i
turned
round
went
up
to
the
table
opened
the
drawer
and
took
out
a
banknote
for
five
thousand
roubles
it
was
lying
in
a
french
dictionary
then
i
showed
it
her
in
silence
folded
it
handed
it
to
her
opened
the
door
into
the
passage
and
stepping
back
made
her
a
deep
bow
a
most
respectful
a
most
impressive
bow
believe
me
she
shuddered
all
over
gazed
at
me
for
a
second
turned
horribly
pale
white
as
a
sheet
in
fact
and
all
at
once
not
impetuously
but
softly
gently
bowed
down
to
my
feet
not
a
boarding
school
curtsey
but
a
russian
bow
with
her
forehead
to
the
floor
she
jumped
up
and
ran
away
i
was
wearing
my
sword
i
drew
it
and
nearly
stabbed
myself
with
it
on
the
spot
why
i
don
t
know
it
would
have
been
frightfully
stupid
of
course
i
suppose
it
was
from
delight
can
you
understand
that
one
might
kill
oneself
from
delight
but
i
didn
t
stab
myself
i
only
kissed
my
sword
and
put
it
back
in
the
scabbard
which
there
was
no
need
to
have
told
you
by
the
way
and
i
fancy
that
in
telling
you
about
my
inner
conflict
i
have
laid
it
on
rather
thick
to
glorify
myself
but
let
it
pass
and
to
hell
with
all
who
pry
into
the
human
heart
well
so
much
for
that
adventure
with
katerina
ivanovna
so
now
ivan
knows
of
it
and
you
no
one
else
dmitri
got
up
took
a
step
or
two
in
his
excitement
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
forehead
then
sat
down
again
not
in
the
same
place
as
before
but
on
the
opposite
side
so
that
alyosha
had
to
turn
quite
round
to
face
him
chapter
v
the
confession
of
a
passionate
heart
heels
up
now
said
alyosha
i
understand
the
first
half
you
understand
the
first
half
that
half
is
a
drama
and
it
was
played
out
there
the
second
half
is
a
tragedy
and
it
is
being
acted
here
and
i
understand
nothing
of
that
second
half
so
far
said
alyosha
and
i
do
you
suppose
i
understand
it
stop
dmitri
there
s
one
important
question
tell
me
you
were
betrothed
you
are
betrothed
still
we
weren
t
betrothed
at
once
not
for
three
months
after
that
adventure
the
next
day
i
told
myself
that
the
incident
was
closed
concluded
that
there
would
be
no
sequel
it
seemed
to
me
caddish
to
make
her
an
offer
on
her
side
she
gave
no
sign
of
life
for
the
six
weeks
that
she
remained
in
the
town
except
indeed
for
one
action
the
day
after
her
visit
the
maid
servant
slipped
round
with
an
envelope
addressed
to
me
i
tore
it
open
it
contained
the
change
out
of
the
banknote
only
four
thousand
five
hundred
roubles
was
needed
but
there
was
a
discount
of
about
two
hundred
on
changing
it
she
only
sent
me
about
two
hundred
and
sixty
i
don
t
remember
exactly
but
not
a
note
not
a
word
of
explanation
i
searched
the
packet
for
a
pencil
mark
n
nothing
well
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
money
on
such
an
orgy
that
the
new
major
was
obliged
to
reprimand
me
well
the
lieutenant
colonel
produced
the
battalion
money
to
the
astonishment
of
every
one
for
nobody
believed
that
he
had
the
money
untouched
he
d
no
sooner
paid
it
than
he
fell
ill
took
to
his
bed
and
three
weeks
later
softening
of
the
brain
set
in
and
he
died
five
days
afterwards
he
was
buried
with
military
honors
for
he
had
not
had
time
to
receive
his
discharge
ten
days
after
his
funeral
katerina
ivanovna
with
her
aunt
and
sister
went
to
moscow
and
behold
on
the
very
day
they
went
away
i
hadn
t
seen
them
didn
t
see
them
off
or
take
leave
i
received
a
tiny
note
a
sheet
of
thin
blue
paper
and
on
it
only
one
line
in
pencil
i
will
write
to
you
wait
k
and
that
was
all
i
ll
explain
the
rest
now
in
two
words
in
moscow
their
fortunes
changed
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
and
the
unexpectedness
of
an
arabian
fairy
tale
that
general
s
widow
their
nearest
relation
suddenly
lost
the
two
nieces
who
were
her
heiresses
and
next
of
kin
both
died
in
the
same
week
of
small
pox
the
old
lady
prostrated
with
grief
welcomed
katya
as
a
daughter
as
her
one
hope
clutched
at
her
altered
her
will
in
katya
s
favor
but
that
concerned
the
future
meanwhile
she
gave
her
for
present
use
eighty
thousand
roubles
as
a
marriage
portion
to
do
what
she
liked
with
she
was
an
hysterical
woman
i
saw
something
of
her
in
moscow
later
well
suddenly
i
received
by
post
four
thousand
five
hundred
roubles
i
was
speechless
with
surprise
as
you
may
suppose
three
days
later
came
the
promised
letter
i
have
it
with
me
now
you
must
read
it
she
offers
to
be
my
wife
offers
herself
to
me
i
love
you
madly
she
says
even
if
you
don
t
love
me
never
mind
be
my
husband
don
t
be
afraid
i
won
t
hamper
you
in
any
way
i
will
be
your
chattel
i
will
be
the
carpet
under
your
feet
i
want
to
love
you
for
ever
i
want
to
save
you
from
yourself
alyosha
i
am
not
worthy
to
repeat
those
lines
in
my
vulgar
words
and
in
my
vulgar
tone
my
everlastingly
vulgar
tone
that
i
can
never
cure
myself
of
that
letter
stabs
me
even
now
do
you
think
i
don
t
mind
that
i
don
t
mind
still
i
wrote
her
an
answer
at
once
as
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
go
to
moscow
i
wrote
to
her
with
tears
one
thing
i
shall
be
ashamed
of
for
ever
i
referred
to
her
being
rich
and
having
a
dowry
while
i
was
only
a
stuck
up
beggar
i
mentioned
money
i
ought
to
have
borne
it
in
silence
but
it
slipped
from
my
pen
then
i
wrote
at
once
to
ivan
and
told
him
all
i
could
about
it
in
a
letter
of
six
pages
and
sent
him
to
her
why
do
you
look
like
that
why
are
you
staring
at
me
yes
ivan
fell
in
love
with
her
he
s
in
love
with
her
still
i
know
that
i
did
a
stupid
thing
in
the
world
s
opinion
but
perhaps
that
one
stupid
thing
may
be
the
saving
of
us
all
now
oo
don
t
you
see
what
a
lot
she
thinks
of
ivan
how
she
respects
him
when
she
compares
us
do
you
suppose
she
can
love
a
man
like
me
especially
after
all
that
has
happened
here
but
i
am
convinced
that
she
does
love
a
man
like
you
and
not
a
man
like
him
she
loves
her
own
virtue
not
me
the
words
broke
involuntarily
and
almost
malignantly
from
dmitri
he
laughed
but
a
minute
later
his
eyes
gleamed
he
flushed
crimson
and
struck
the
table
violently
with
his
fist
i
swear
alyosha
he
cried
with
intense
and
genuine
anger
at
himself
you
may
not
believe
me
but
as
god
is
holy
and
as
christ
is
god
i
swear
that
though
i
smiled
at
her
lofty
sentiments
just
now
i
know
that
i
am
a
million
times
baser
in
soul
than
she
and
that
these
lofty
sentiments
of
hers
are
as
sincere
as
a
heavenly
angel
s
that
s
the
tragedy
of
it
that
i
know
that
for
certain
what
if
any
one
does
show
off
a
bit
don
t
i
do
it
myself
and
yet
i
m
sincere
i
m
sincere
as
for
ivan
i
can
understand
how
he
must
be
cursing
nature
now
with
his
intellect
too
to
see
the
preference
given
to
whom
to
what
to
a
monster
who
though
he
is
betrothed
and
all
eyes
are
fixed
on
him
can
t
restrain
his
debaucheries
and
before
the
very
eyes
of
his
betrothed
and
a
man
like
me
is
preferred
while
he
is
rejected
and
why
because
a
girl
wants
to
sacrifice
her
life
and
destiny
out
of
gratitude
it
s
ridiculous
i
ve
never
said
a
word
of
this
to
ivan
and
ivan
of
course
has
never
dropped
a
hint
of
the
sort
to
me
but
destiny
will
be
accomplished
and
the
best
man
will
hold
his
ground
while
the
undeserving
one
will
vanish
into
his
back
alley
for
ever
his
filthy
back
alley
his
beloved
back
alley
where
he
is
at
home
and
where
he
will
sink
in
filth
and
stench
at
his
own
free
will
and
with
enjoyment
i
ve
been
talking
foolishly
i
ve
no
words
left
i
use
them
at
random
but
it
will
be
as
i
have
said
i
shall
drown
in
the
back
alley
and
she
will
marry
ivan
stop
dmitri
alyosha
interrupted
again
with
great
anxiety
there
s
one
thing
you
haven
t
made
clear
yet
you
are
still
betrothed
all
the
same
aren
t
you
how
can
you
break
off
the
engagement
if
she
your
betrothed
doesn
t
want
to
yes
formally
and
solemnly
betrothed
it
was
all
done
on
my
arrival
in
moscow
with
great
ceremony
with
ikons
all
in
fine
style
the
general
s
wife
blessed
us
and
would
you
believe
it
congratulated
katya
you
ve
made
a
good
choice
she
said
i
see
right
through
him
and
would
you
believe
it
she
didn
t
like
ivan
and
hardly
greeted
him
i
had
a
lot
of
talk
with
katya
in
moscow
i
told
her
about
myself
sincerely
honorably
she
listened
to
everything
there
was
sweet
confusion
there
were
tender
words
though
there
were
proud
words
too
she
wrung
out
of
me
a
mighty
promise
to
reform
i
gave
my
promise
and
here
what
why
i
called
to
you
and
brought
you
out
here
to
day
this
very
day
remember
it
to
send
you
this
very
day
again
to
katerina
ivanovna
and
what
to
tell
her
that
i
shall
never
come
to
see
her
again
say
he
sends
you
his
compliments
but
is
that
possible
that
s
just
the
reason
i
m
sending
you
in
my
place
because
it
s
impossible
and
how
could
i
tell
her
myself
and
where
are
you
going
to
the
back
alley
to
grushenka
then
alyosha
exclaimed
mournfully
clasping
his
hands
can
rakitin
really
have
told
the
truth
i
thought
that
you
had
just
visited
her
and
that
was
all
can
a
betrothed
man
pay
such
visits
is
such
a
thing
possible
and
with
such
a
betrothed
and
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
confound
it
i
have
some
honor
as
soon
as
i
began
visiting
grushenka
i
ceased
to
be
betrothed
and
to
be
an
honest
man
i
understand
that
why
do
you
look
at
me
you
see
i
went
in
the
first
place
to
beat
her
i
had
heard
and
i
know
for
a
fact
now
that
that
captain
father
s
agent
had
given
grushenka
an
i
o
u
of
mine
for
her
to
sue
me
for
payment
so
as
to
put
an
end
to
me
they
wanted
to
scare
me
i
went
to
beat
her
i
had
had
a
glimpse
of
her
before
she
doesn
t
strike
one
at
first
sight
i
knew
about
her
old
merchant
who
s
lying
ill
now
paralyzed
but
he
s
leaving
her
a
decent
little
sum
i
knew
too
that
she
was
fond
of
money
that
she
hoarded
it
and
lent
it
at
a
wicked
rate
of
interest
that
she
s
a
merciless
cheat
and
swindler
i
went
to
beat
her
and
i
stayed
the
storm
broke
it
struck
me
down
like
the
plague
i
m
plague
stricken
still
and
i
know
that
everything
is
over
that
there
will
never
be
anything
more
for
me
the
cycle
of
the
ages
is
accomplished
that
s
my
position
and
though
i
m
a
beggar
as
fate
would
have
it
i
had
three
thousand
just
then
in
my
pocket
i
drove
with
grushenka
to
mokroe
a
place
twenty
five
versts
from
here
i
got
gypsies
there
and
champagne
and
made
all
the
peasants
there
drunk
on
it
and
all
the
women
and
girls
i
sent
the
thousands
flying
in
three
days
time
i
was
stripped
bare
but
a
hero
do
you
suppose
the
hero
had
gained
his
end
not
a
sign
of
it
from
her
i
tell
you
that
rogue
grushenka
has
a
supple
curve
all
over
her
body
you
can
see
it
in
her
little
foot
even
in
her
little
toe
i
saw
it
and
kissed
it
but
that
was
all
i
swear
i
ll
marry
you
if
you
like
she
said
you
re
a
beggar
you
know
say
that
you
won
t
beat
me
and
will
let
me
do
anything
i
choose
and
perhaps
i
will
marry
you
she
laughed
and
she
s
laughing
still
dmitri
leapt
up
with
a
sort
of
fury
he
seemed
all
at
once
as
though
he
were
drunk
his
eyes
became
suddenly
bloodshot
and
do
you
really
mean
to
marry
her
at
once
if
she
will
and
if
she
won
t
i
shall
stay
all
the
same
i
ll
be
the
porter
at
her
gate
alyosha
he
cried
he
stopped
short
before
him
and
taking
him
by
the
shoulders
began
shaking
him
violently
do
you
know
you
innocent
boy
that
this
is
all
delirium
senseless
delirium
for
there
s
a
tragedy
here
let
me
tell
you
alexey
that
i
may
be
a
low
man
with
low
and
degraded
passions
but
a
thief
and
a
pickpocket
dmitri
karamazov
never
can
be
well
then
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
a
thief
and
a
pickpocket
that
very
morning
just
before
i
went
to
beat
grushenka
katerina
ivanovna
sent
for
me
and
in
strict
secrecy
why
i
don
t
know
i
suppose
she
had
some
reason
asked
me
to
go
to
the
chief
town
of
the
province
and
to
post
three
thousand
roubles
to
agafya
ivanovna
in
moscow
so
that
nothing
should
be
known
of
it
in
the
town
here
so
i
had
that
three
thousand
roubles
in
my
pocket
when
i
went
to
see
grushenka
and
it
was
that
money
we
spent
at
mokroe
afterwards
i
pretended
i
had
been
to
the
town
but
did
not
show
her
the
post
office
receipt
i
said
i
had
sent
the
money
and
would
bring
the
receipt
and
so
far
i
haven
t
brought
it
i
ve
forgotten
it
now
what
do
you
think
you
re
going
to
her
to
day
to
say
he
sends
his
compliments
and
she
ll
ask
you
what
about
the
money
you
might
still
have
said
to
her
he
s
a
degraded
sensualist
and
a
low
creature
with
uncontrolled
passions
he
didn
t
send
your
money
then
but
wasted
it
because
like
a
low
brute
he
couldn
t
control
himself
but
still
you
might
have
added
he
isn
t
a
thief
though
here
is
your
three
thousand
he
sends
it
back
send
it
yourself
to
agafya
ivanovna
but
he
told
me
to
say
he
sends
his
compliments
but
as
it
is
she
will
ask
but
where
is
the
money
mitya
you
are
unhappy
yes
but
not
as
unhappy
as
you
think
don
t
worry
yourself
to

meaning
of
despair
alexey
yes

had
it
all
from

that
but
morally

owes
me
something
doesn
t
he
you
know
he
started
with
twenty
eight
thousand
of
my
mother
s
money
and
made
a
hundred
thousand
with
it
let
him
give
me
back
only
three
out
of
the
twenty
eight
thousand
and
he

draw
my
soul
out
of
hell
and

for
many
of
his
sins
for
that
three
thousand

you
my
solemn
word
i

make
an
end
of
everything
and

the
last
time
i
give
him
the
chance
to
be
a
father
tell
him
god
himself
sends
him
this
chance
mitya
he
won
t
give
it
for
anything
i
know
he
won
t
i
know
it
perfectly
well
now
especially
that
s
not
all
i
know
something
more
now
only
a
few
days
ago
perhaps
only
yesterday
he
found
out
for
the
first
time
in
earnest
underline
in
earnest
that
grushenka
is
really
perhaps
not
joking
and
really
means
to
marry
me
he
knows
her
nature
he
knows
the
cat
and
do
you
suppose
he
s
going
to
give
me
money
to
help
to
bring
that
about
when
he
s
crazy
about
her
himself
and
that
s
not
all
either
i
can
tell
you
more
than
that
i
know
that
for
the
last
five
days
he
has
had
three
thousand
drawn
out
of
the
bank
changed
into
notes
of
a
hundred
roubles
packed
into
a
large
envelope
sealed
with
five
seals
and
tied
across
with
red
tape
you
see
how
well
i
know
all
about
it
on
the
envelope
is
written
to
my
angel
grushenka
when
she
will
come
to
me
he
scrawled
it
himself
in
silence
and
in
secret
and
no
one
knows
that
the
money
s
there
except
the
valet
smerdyakov
whom
he
trusts
like
himself
so
now
he
has
been
expecting
grushenka
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
he
hopes
she
ll
come
for
the
money
he
has
sent
her
word
of
it
and
she
has
sent
him
word
that
perhaps
she
ll
come
and
if
she
does
go
to
the
old
man
can
i
marry
her
after
that
you
understand
now
why
i
m
here
in
secret
and
what
i
m
on
the
watch
for
for
her
yes
for
her
foma
has
a
room
in
the
house
of
these
sluts
here
foma
comes
from
our
parts
he
was
a
soldier
in
our
regiment
he
does
jobs
for
them
he
s
watchman
at
night
and
goes
grouse
shooting
in
the
day
time
and
that
s
how
he
lives
i
ve
established
myself
in
his
room
neither
he
nor
the
women
of
the
house
know
the
secret
that
is
that
i
am
on
the
watch
here
no
one
but
smerdyakov
knows
then
no
one
else
he
will
let
me
know
if
she
goes
to
the
old
man
it
was
he
told
you
about
the
money
then
yes
it
s
a
dead
secret
even
ivan
doesn
t
know
about
the
money
or
anything
the
old
man
is
sending
ivan
to
tchermashnya
on
a
two
or
three
days
journey
a
purchaser
has
turned
up
for
the
copse
he
ll
give
eight
thousand
for
the
timber
so
the
old
man
keeps
asking
ivan
to
help
him
by
going
to
arrange
it
it
will
take
him
two
or
three
days
that
s
what
the
old
man
wants
so
that
grushenka
can
come
while
he
s
away
then
he
s
expecting
grushenka
to
day
no
she
won
t
come
to
day
there
are
signs
she
s
certain
not
to
come
cried
mitya
suddenly
smerdyakov
thinks
so
too
father
s
drinking
now
he
s
sitting
at
table
with
ivan
go
to
him
alyosha
and
ask
for
the
three
thousand
mitya
dear
what
s
the
matter
with
you
cried
alyosha
jumping
up
from
his
place
and
looking
keenly
at
his
brother
s
frenzied
face
for
one
moment
the
thought
struck
him
that
dmitri
was
mad
what
is
it
i
m
not
insane
said
dmitri
looking
intently
and
earnestly
at
him
no
fear
i
am
sending
you
to
father
and
i
know
what
i
m
saying
i
believe
in
miracles
in
miracles
in
a
miracle
of
divine
providence
god
knows
my
heart
he
sees
my
despair
he
sees
the
whole
picture
surely
he
won
t
let
something
awful
happen
alyosha
i
believe
in
miracles
go
i
am
going
tell
me
will
you
wait
for
me
here
yes
i
know
it
will
take
some
time
you
can
t
go
at
him
point
blank
he
s
drunk
now
i
ll
wait
three
hours
four
five
six
seven
only
remember
you
must
go
to
katerina
ivanovna
to
day
if
it
has
to
be
at
midnight
with
the
money
or
without
the
money
and
say
he
sends
his
compliments
to
you
i
want
you
to
say
that
verse
to
her
he
sends
his
compliments
to
you
mitya
and
what
if
grushenka
comes
to
day
if
not
to
day
to
morrow
or
the
next
day
grushenka
i
shall
see
her
i
shall
rush
out
and
prevent
it
and
if
if
there
s
an
if
it
will
be
murder
i
couldn

endure
it
who

the
old
man
i

her
brother
what
are
you
saying
oh
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
perhaps
i
shan

and
perhaps
i
shall
i
m
afraid
that
he
will
suddenly
become
so
loathsome
to
me
with
his
face
at
that
moment
i
hate
his
ugly
throat
his
nose
his
eyes
his
shameless
snigger
i
feel
a
physical
repulsion
that
s
what
i
m
afraid
of
that
s
what
may
be
too
much
for
me
i
ll
go
mitya
i
believe
that
god
will
order
things
for
the
best
that
nothing
awful
may
happen
and
i
will
sit
and
wait
for
the
miracle
and
if
it
doesn
t
come
to
pass
alyosha
went
thoughtfully
towards
his
father
s
house
chapter
vi
smerdyakov
he
did
in
fact
find
his
father
still
at
table
though
there
was
a
dining
room
in
the
house
the
table
was
laid
as
usual
in
the
drawing
room
which
was
the
largest
room
and
furnished
with
old
fashioned
ostentation
the
furniture
was
white
and
very
old
upholstered
in
old
red
silky
material
in
the
spaces
between
the
windows
there
were
mirrors
in
elaborate
white
and
gilt
frames
of
old
fashioned
carving
on
the
walls
covered
with
white
paper
which
was
torn
in
many
places
there
hung
two
large
portraits
one
of
some
prince
who
had
been
governor
of
the
district
thirty
years
before
and
the
other
of
some
bishop
also
long
since
dead
in
the
corner
opposite
the
door
there
were
several
ikons
before
which
a
lamp
was
lighted
at
nightfall
not
so
much
for
devotional
purposes
as
to
light
the
room
fyodor
pavlovitch
used
to
go
to
bed
very
late
at
three
or
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
would
wander
about
the
room
at
night
or
sit
in
an
arm
chair
thinking
this
had
become
a
habit
with
him
he
often
slept
quite
alone
in
the
house
sending
his
servants
to
the
lodge
but
usually
smerdyakov
remained
sleeping
on
a
bench
in
the
hall
when
alyosha
came
in
dinner
was
over
but
coffee
and
preserves
had
been
served
fyodor
pavlovitch
liked
sweet
things
with
brandy
after
dinner
ivan
was
also
at
table
sipping
coffee
the
servants
grigory
and
smerdyakov
were
standing
by
both
the
gentlemen
and
the
servants
seemed
in
singularly
good
spirits
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
roaring
with
laughter
before
he
entered
the
room
alyosha
heard
the
shrill
laugh
he
knew
so
well
and
could
tell
from
the
sound
of
it
that
his
father
had
only
reached
the
good
humored
stage
and
was
far
from
being
completely
drunk
here
he
is
here
he
is
yelled
fyodor
pavlovitch
highly
delighted
at
seeing
alyosha

alyosha
began
refusing
the
liqueur
never
mind
if
you
won
t
have
it
we
will
said
fyodor
pavlovitch
beaming
but
stay

you
dined
yes
answered
alyosha
who
had
in
truth
only
eaten
a
piece
of
bread
and
drunk
a
glass
of
kvas
in
the
father
superior

kitchen
though

over
i
m
so
fond
of

alyosha
let
me
give
you
my
blessing
a
father
s
blessing
alyosha
rose
but
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
already
changed
his
mind
no
no
he
said
i
ll
just
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
you
for
now
sit
still
now
we
ve
a
treat
for
you
in
your
own
line
too
it
ll
make
you
laugh
balaam
s
ass
has
begun
talking
to
us
here
and
how
he
talks
how
he
talks
balaam
s
ass
it
appeared
was
the
valet
smerdyakov
he
was
a
young
man
of
about
four
and
twenty
remarkably
unsociable
and
taciturn
not
that
he
was
shy
or
bashful
on
the
contrary
he
was
conceited
and
seemed
to
despise
everybody
but
we
must
pause
to
say
a
few
words
about
him
now
he
was
brought
up
by
grigory
and
marfa
but
the
boy
grew
up
with
no
sense
of
gratitude
as
grigory
expressed
it
he
was
an
unfriendly
boy
and
seemed
to
look
at
the
world
mistrustfully
in
his
childhood
he
was
very
fond
of
hanging
cats
and
burying
them
with
great
ceremony
he
used
to
dress
up
in
a
sheet
as
though
it
were
a
surplice
and
sang
and
waved
some
object
over
the
dead
cat
as
though
it
were
a
censer
all
this
he
did
on
the
sly
with
the
greatest
secrecy
grigory
caught
him
once
at
this
diversion
and
gave
him
a
sound
beating
he
shrank
into
a
corner
and
sulked
there
for
a
week
he
doesn
t
care
for
you
or
me
the
monster
grigory
used
to
say
to
marfa
and
he
doesn
t
care
for
any
one
are
you
a
human
being
he
said
addressing
the
boy
directly
you
re
not
a
human
being
you
grew
from
the
mildew
in
the
bath
house
2
that
s
what
you
are
smerdyakov
it
appeared
afterwards
could
never
forgive
him
those
words
grigory
taught
him
to
read
and
write
and
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
began
teaching
him
the
scriptures
but
this
teaching
came
to
nothing
at
the
second
or
third
lesson
the
boy
suddenly
grinned
what
s
that
for
asked
grigory
looking
at
him
threateningly
from
under
his
spectacles
oh
nothing
god
created
light
on
the
first
day
and
the
sun
moon
and
stars
on
the
fourth
day
where
did
the
light
come
from
on
the
first
day
grigory
was
thunderstruck
the
boy
looked
sarcastically
at
his
teacher
there
was
something
positively
condescending
in
his
expression
grigory
could
not
restrain
himself
i
ll
show
you
where
he
cried
and
gave
the
boy
a
violent
slap
on
the
cheek
the
boy
took
the
slap
without
a
word
but
withdrew
into
his
corner
again
for
some
days
a
week
later
he
had
his
first
attack
of
the
disease
to
which
he
was
subject
all
the
rest
of
his
life
epilepsy
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
heard
of
it
his
attitude
to
the
boy
seemed
changed
at
once
till
then
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
him
though
he
never
scolded
him
and
always
gave
him
a
copeck
when
he
met
him
sometimes
when
he
was
in
good
humor
he
would
send
the
boy
something
sweet
from
his
table
but
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
his
illness
he
showed
an
active
interest
in
him
sent
for
a
doctor
and
tried
remedies
but
the
disease
turned
out
to
be
incurable
the
fits
occurred
on
an
average
once
a
month
but
at
various
intervals
the
fits
varied
too
in
violence
some
were
light
and
some
were
very
severe
fyodor
pavlovitch
strictly
forbade
grigory
to
use
corporal
punishment
to
the
boy
and
began
allowing
him
to
come
upstairs
to
him
he
forbade
him
to
be
taught
anything
whatever
for
a
time
too
one
day
when
the
boy
was
about
fifteen
fyodor
pavlovitch
noticed
him
lingering
by
the
bookcase
and
reading
the
titles
through
the
glass
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
a
fair
number
of
books
over
a
hundred
but
no
one
ever
saw
him
reading
he
at
once
gave
smerdyakov
the
key
of
the
bookcase
come
read
you
shall
be
my
librarian
you
ll
be
better
sitting
reading
than
hanging
about
the
courtyard
come
read
this
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
gave
him
evenings
in
a
cottage
near
dikanka
he
read
a
little
but
didn
t
like
it
he
did
not
once
smile
and
ended
by
frowning
why
isn
t
it
funny
asked
fyodor
pavlovitch
smerdyakov
did
not
speak
answer
stupid
it
s
all
untrue
mumbled
the
boy
with
a
grin
then
go
to
the
devil
you
have
the
soul
of
a
lackey
stay
here
s
smaragdov
s
universal
history
that
s
all
true
read
that
but
smerdyakov
did
not
get
through
ten
pages
of
smaragdov
he
thought
it
dull
so
the
bookcase
was
closed
again
shortly
afterwards
marfa
and
grigory
reported
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
that
smerdyakov
was
gradually
beginning
to
show
an
extraordinary
fastidiousness
he
would
sit
before
his
soup
take
up
his
spoon
and
look
into
the
soup
bend
over
it
examine
it
take
a
spoonful
and
hold
it
to
the
light
what
is
it
a
beetle
grigory
would
ask
a
fly
perhaps
observed
marfa
the
squeamish
youth
never
answered
but
he
did
the
same
with
his
bread
his
meat
and
everything
he
ate
he
would
hold
a
piece
on
his
fork
to
the
light
scrutinize
it
microscopically
and
only
after
long
deliberation
decide
to
put
it
in
his
mouth
ach
what
fine
gentlemen
s
airs
grigory
muttered
looking
at
him
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
heard
of
this
development
in
smerdyakov
he
determined
to
make
him
his
cook
and
sent
him
to
moscow
to
be
trained
he
spent
some
years
there
and
came
back
remarkably
changed
in
appearance
he
looked
extraordinarily
old
for
his
age
his
face
had
grown
wrinkled
yellow
and
strangely
emasculate
in
character
he
seemed
almost
exactly
the
same
as
before
he
went
away
he
was
just
as
unsociable
and
showed
not
the
slightest
inclination
for
any
companionship
in
moscow
too
as
we
heard
afterwards
he
had
always
been
silent
moscow
itself
had
little
interest
for
him
he
saw
very
little
there
and
took
scarcely
any
notice
of
anything
he
went
once
to
the
theater
but
returned
silent
and
displeased
with
it
on
the
other
hand
he
came
back
to
us
from
moscow
well
dressed
in
a
clean
coat
and
clean
linen
he
brushed
his
clothes
most
scrupulously
twice
a
day
invariably
and
was
very
fond
of
cleaning
his
smart
calf
boots
with
a
special
english
polish
so
that
they
shone
like
mirrors
he
turned
out
a
first
rate
cook
fyodor
pavlovitch
paid
him
a
salary
almost
the
whole
of
which
smerdyakov
spent
on
clothes
pomade
perfumes
and
such
things
but
he
seemed
to
have
as
much
contempt
for
the
female
sex
as
for
men
he
was
discreet
almost
unapproachable
with
them
fyodor
pavlovitch
began
to
regard
him
rather
differently
his
fits
were
becoming
more
frequent
and
on
the
days
he
was
ill
marfa
cooked
which
did
not
suit
fyodor
pavlovitch
at
all
why
are
your
fits
getting
worse
asked
fyodor
pavlovitch
looking
askance
at
his
new
cook
would
you
like
to
get
married
shall
i
find
you
a
wife
but
smerdyakov
turned
pale
with
anger
and
made
no
reply
fyodor
pavlovitch
left
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
the
great
thing
was
that
he
had
absolute
confidence
in
his
honesty
it
happened
once
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
drunk
that
he
dropped
in
the
muddy
courtyard
three
hundred
rouble
notes
which
he
had
only
just
received
he
only
missed
them
next
day
and
was
just
hastening
to
search
his
pockets
when
he
saw
the
notes
lying
on
the
table
where
had
they
come
from
smerdyakov
had
picked
them
up
and
brought
them
in
the
day
before
well
my
lad
i
ve
never
met
any
one
like
you
fyodor
pavlovitch
said
shortly
and
gave
him
ten
roubles
we
may
add
that
he
not
only
believed
in
his
honesty
but
had
for
some
reason
a
liking
for
him
although
the
young
man
looked
as
morosely
at
him
as
at
every
one
and
was
always
silent
he
rarely
spoke
if
it
had
occurred
to
any
one
to
wonder
at
the
time
what
the
young
man
was
interested
in
and
what
was
in
his
mind
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
tell
by
looking
at
him
yet
he
used
sometimes
to
stop
suddenly
in
the
house
or
even
in
the
yard
or
street
and
would
stand
still
for
ten
minutes
lost
in
thought
a
physiognomist
studying
his
face
would
have
said
that
there
was
no
thought
in
it
no
reflection
but
only
a
sort
of
contemplation
there
is
a
remarkable
picture
by
the
painter
kramskoy
called
contemplation
there
is
a
forest
in
winter
and
on
a
roadway
through
the
forest
in
absolute
solitude
stands
a
peasant
in
a
torn
kaftan
and
bark
shoes
he
stands
as
it
were
lost
in
thought
yet
he
is
not
thinking
he
is
contemplating
if
any
one
touched
him
he
would
start
and
look
at
one
as
though
awakening
and
bewildered
it
s
true
he
would
come
to
himself
immediately
but
if
he
were
asked
what
he
had
been
thinking
about
he
would
remember
nothing
yet
probably
he
has
hidden
within
himself
the
impression
which
had
dominated
him
during
the
period
of
contemplation
those
impressions
are
dear
to
him
and
no
doubt
he
hoards
them
imperceptibly
and
even
unconsciously
how
and
why
of
course
he
does
not
know
either
he
may
suddenly
after
hoarding
impressions
for
many
years
abandon
everything
and
go
off
to
jerusalem
on
a
pilgrimage
for
his
soul
s
salvation
or
perhaps
he
will
suddenly
set
fire
to
his
native
village
and
perhaps
do
both
there
are
a
good
many
contemplatives
among
the
peasantry
well
smerdyakov
was
probably
one
of
them
and
he
probably
was
greedily
hoarding
up
his
impressions
hardly
knowing
why
chapter
vii
the
controversy
but
balaam
s
ass
had
suddenly
spoken
the
subject
was
a
strange
one
grigory
had
gone
in
the
morning
to
make
purchases
and
had
heard
from
the
shopkeeper
lukyanov
the
story
of
a
russian
soldier
which
had
appeared
in
the
newspaper
of
that
day
this
soldier
had
been
taken
prisoner
in
some
remote
part
of
asia
and
was
threatened
with
an
immediate
agonizing
death
if
he
did
not
renounce
christianity
and
follow
islam
he
refused
to
deny
his
faith
and
was
tortured
flayed
alive
and
died
praising
and
glorifying
christ
grigory
had
related
the
story
at
table
fyodor
pavlovitch
always
liked
over
the
dessert
after
dinner
to
laugh
and
talk
if
only
with
grigory
this
afternoon
he
was
in
a
particularly
good
humored
and
expansive
mood
sipping
his
brandy
and
listening
to
the
story
he
observed
that
they
ought
to
make
a
saint
of
a
soldier
like
that
and
to
take
his
skin
to
some
monastery
that
would
make
the
people
flock
and
bring
the
money
in
grigory
frowned
seeing
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
by
no
means
touched
but
as
usual
was
beginning
to
scoff
at
that
moment
smerdyakov
who
was
standing
by
the
door
smiled
smerdyakov
often
waited
at
table
towards
the
end
of
dinner
and
since
ivan
s
arrival
in
our
town
he
had
done
so
every
day
what
are
you
grinning
at
asked
fyodor
pavlovitch
catching
the
smile
instantly
and
knowing
that
it
referred
to
grigory
well
my
opinion
is
smerdyakov
began
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
in
a
loud
voice
that
if
that
laudable
soldier
s
exploit
was
so
very
great
there
would
have
been
to
my
thinking
no
sin
in
it
if
he
had
on
such
an
emergency
renounced
so
to
speak
the
name
of
christ
and
his
own
christening
to
save
by
that
same
his
life
for
good
deeds
by
which
in
the
course
of
years
to
expiate
his
cowardice
how
could
it
not
be
a
sin
you
re
talking
nonsense
for
that
you
ll
go
straight
to
hell
and
be
roasted
there
like
mutton
put
in
fyodor
pavlovitch
it
was
at
this
point
that
alyosha
came
in
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
as
we
have
seen
was
highly
delighted
at
his
appearance
we
re
on
your
subject
your
subject
he
chuckled
gleefully
making
alyosha
sit
down
to
listen
as
for
mutton
that
s
not
so
and
there
ll
be
nothing
there
for
this
and
there
shouldn
t
be
either
if
it
s
according
to
justice
smerdyakov
maintained
stoutly
how
do
you
mean
according
to
justice
fyodor
pavlovitch
cried
still
more
gayly
nudging
alyosha
with
his
knee
he
s
a
rascal
that
s
what
he
is
burst
from
grigory
he
looked
smerdyakov
wrathfully
in
the
face
as
for
being
a
rascal
wait
a
little
grigory
vassilyevitch
answered
smerdyakov
with
perfect
composure
you
d
better
consider
yourself
that
once
i
am
taken
prisoner
by
the
enemies
of
the
christian
race
and
they
demand
from
me
to
curse
the
name
of
god
and
to
renounce
my
holy
christening
i
am
fully
entitled
to
act
by
my
own
reason
since
there
would
be
no
sin
in
it
but
you
ve
said
that
before
don
t
waste
words
prove
it
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
soup
maker
muttered
grigory
contemptuously
as
for
being
a
soup
maker
wait
a
bit
too
and
consider
for
yourself
grigory
vassilyevitch
without
abusing
me
for
as
soon
as
i
say
to
those
enemies
no
i
m
not
a
christian
and
i
curse
my
true
god
then
at
once
by
god
s
high
judgment
i
become
immediately
and
specially
anathema
accursed
and
am
cut
off
from
the
holy
church
exactly
as
though
i
were
a
heathen
so
that
at
that
very
instant
not
only
when
i
say
it
aloud
but
when
i
think
of
saying
it
before
a
quarter
of
a
second
has
passed
i
am
cut
off
is
that
so
or
not
grigory
vassilyevitch
he
addressed
grigory
with
obvious
satisfaction
though
he
was
really
answering
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
questions
and
was
well
aware
of
it
and
intentionally
pretending
that
grigory
had
asked
the
questions
ivan
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
suddenly
stoop
down
for
me
to
whisper
he
s
got
this
all
up
for
your
benefit
he
wants
you
to
praise
him
praise
him
ivan
listened
with
perfect
seriousness
to
his
father
s
excited
whisper
stay
smerdyakov
be
quiet
a
minute
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
once
more
ivan
your
ear
again
ivan
bent
down
again
with
a
perfectly
grave
face
i
love
you
as
i
do
alyosha
don
t
think
i
don
t
love
you
some
brandy
yes
but
you
re
rather
drunk
yourself
thought
ivan
looking
steadily
at
his
father
he
was
watching
smerdyakov
with
great
curiosity
you
re
anathema
accursed
as
it
is
grigory
suddenly
burst
out
and
how
dare
you
argue
you
rascal
after
that
if
don
t
scold
him
grigory
don
t
scold
him
fyodor
pavlovitch
cut
him
short
you
should
wait
grigory
vassilyevitch
if
only
a
short
time
and
listen
for
i
haven
t
finished
all
i
had
to
say
for
at
the
very
moment
i
become
accursed
at
that
same
highest
moment
i
become
exactly
like
a
heathen
and
my
christening
is
taken
off
me
and
becomes
of
no
avail
isn
t
that
so
make
haste
and
finish
my
boy
fyodor
pavlovitch
urged
him
sipping
from
his
wine
glass
with
relish
and
if
i
ve
ceased
to
be
a
christian
then
i
told
no
lie
to
the
enemy
when
they
asked
whether
i
was
a
christian
or
not
a
christian
seeing
i
had
already
been
relieved
by
god
himself
of
my
christianity
by
reason
of
the
thought
alone
before
i
had
time
to
utter
a
word
to
the
enemy
and
if
i
have
already
been
discharged
in
what
manner
and
with
what
sort
of
justice
can
i
be
held
responsible
as
a
christian
in
the
other
world
for
having
denied
christ
when
through
the
very
thought
alone
before
denying
him
i
had
been
relieved
from
my
christening
if
i
m
no
longer
a
christian
then
i
can
t
renounce
christ
for
i
ve
nothing
then
to
renounce
who
will
hold
an
unclean
tatar
responsible
grigory
vassilyevitch
even
in
heaven
for
not
having
been
born
a
christian
and
who
would
punish
him
for
that
considering
that
you
can
t
take
two
skins
off
one
ox
for
god
almighty
himself
even
if
he
did
make
the
tatar
responsible
when
he
dies
would
give
him
the
smallest
possible
punishment
i
imagine
since
he
must
be
punished
judging
that
he
is
not
to
blame
if
he
has
come
into
the
world
an
unclean
heathen
from
heathen
parents
the
lord
god
can
t
surely
take
a
tatar
and
say
he
was
a
christian
that
would
mean
that
the
almighty
would
tell
a
real
untruth
and
can
the
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
tell
a
lie
even
in
one
word
grigory
was
thunderstruck
and
looked
at
the
orator
his
eyes
nearly
starting
out
of
his
head
though
he
did
not
clearly
understand
what
was
said
he
had
caught
something
in
this
rigmarole
and
stood
looking
like
a
man
who
has
just
hit
his
head
against
a
wall
fyodor
pavlovitch
emptied
his
glass
and
went
off
into
his
shrill
laugh
alyosha
alyosha
what
do
you
say
to
that
ah
you
casuist
he
must
have
been
with
the
jesuits
somewhere
ivan
oh
you
stinking
jesuit
who
taught
you
but
you
re
talking
nonsense
you
casuist
nonsense
nonsense
nonsense
don
t
cry
grigory
we
ll
reduce
him
to
smoke
and
ashes
in
a
moment
tell
me
this
o
ass
you
may
be
right
before
your
enemies
but
you
have
renounced
your
faith
all
the
same
in
your
own
heart
and
you
say
yourself
that
in
that
very
hour
you
became
anathema
accursed
and
if
once
you
re
anathema
they
won
t
pat
you
on
the
head
for
it
in
hell
what
do
you
say
to
that
my
fine
jesuit
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
have
renounced
it
in
my
own
heart
but
there
was
no
special
sin
in
that
or
if
there
was
sin
it
was
the
most
ordinary
how
s
that
the
most
ordinary
you
lie
accursed
one
hissed
grigory
consider
yourself
grigory
vassilyevitch
smerdyakov
went
on
staid
and
unruffled
conscious
of
his
triumph
but
as
it
were
generous
to
the
vanquished
foe
consider
yourself
grigory
vassilyevitch
it
is
said
in
the
scripture
that
if
you
have
faith
even
as
a
mustard
seed
and
bid
a
mountain
move
into
the
sea
it
will
move
without
the
least
delay
at
your
bidding
well
grigory
vassilyevitch
if
i
m
without
faith
and
you
have
so
great
a
faith
that
you
are
continually
swearing
at
me
you
try
yourself
telling
this
mountain
not
to
move
into
the
sea
for
that
s
a
long
way
off
but
even
to
our
stinking
little
river
which
runs
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
you
ll
see
for
yourself
that
it
won
t
budge
but
will
remain
just
where
it
is
however
much
you
shout
at
it
and
that
shows
grigory
vassilyevitch
that
you
haven
t
faith
in
the
proper
manner
and
only
abuse
others
about
it
again
taking
into
consideration
that
no
one
in
our
day
not
only
you
but
actually
no
one
from
the
highest
person
to
the
lowest
peasant
can
shove
mountains
into
the
sea
except
perhaps
some
one
man
in
the
world
or
at
most
two
and
they
most
likely
are
saving
their
souls
in
secret
somewhere
in
the
egyptian
desert
so
you
wouldn
t
find
them
if
so
it
be
if
all
the
rest
have
no
faith
will
god
curse
all
the
rest
that
is
the
population
of
the
whole
earth
except
about
two
hermits
in
the
desert
and
in
his
well
known
mercy
will
he
not
forgive
one
of
them
and
so
i
m
persuaded
that
though
i
may
once
have
doubted
i
shall
be
forgiven
if
i
shed
tears
of
repentance
stay
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
a
transport
of
delight
so
you
do
suppose
there
are
two
who
can
move
mountains
ivan
make
a
note
of
it
write
it
down
there
you
have
the
russian
all
over
you
re
quite
right
in
saying
it
s
characteristic
of
the
people
s
faith
ivan
assented
with
an
approving
smile
you
agree
then
it
must
be
so
if
you
agree
it
s
true
isn
t
it
alyosha
that
s
the
russian
faith
all
over
isn
t
it
no
smerdyakov
has
not
the
russian
faith
at
all
said
alyosha
firmly
and
gravely
i
m
not
talking
about
his
faith
i
mean
those
two
in
the
desert
only
that
idea
surely
that
s
russian
isn
t
it
yes
that
s
purely
russian
said
alyosha
smiling
your
words
are
worth
a
gold
piece
o
ass
and
i
ll
give
it
to
you
to
day
but
as
to
the
rest
you
talk
nonsense
nonsense
nonsense
let
me
tell
you
stupid
that
we
here
are
all
of
little
faith
only
from
carelessness
because
we
haven
t
time
things
are
too
much
for
us
and
in
the
second
place
the
lord
god
has
given
us
so
little
time
only
twenty
four
hours
in
the
day
so
that
one
hasn
t
even
time
to
get
sleep
enough
much
less
to
repent
of
one
s
sins
while
you
have
denied
your
faith
to
your
enemies
when
you
d
nothing
else
to
think
about
but
to
show
your
faith
so
i
consider
brother
that
it
constitutes
a
sin
constitute
a
sin
it
may
but
consider
yourself
grigory
vassilyevitch
that
it
only
extenuates
it
if
it
does
constitute
if
i
had
believed
then
in
very
truth
as
i
ought
to
have
believed
then
it
really
would
have
been
sinful
if
i
had
not
faced
tortures
for
my
faith
and
had
gone
over
to
the
pagan
mohammedan
faith
but
of
course
it
wouldn
t
have
come
to
torture
then
because
i
should
only
have
had
to
say
at
that
instant
to
the
mountain
move
and
crush
the
tormentor
and
it
would
have
moved
and
at
the
very
instant
have
crushed
him
like
a
black
beetle
and
i
should
have
walked
away
as
though
nothing
had
happened
praising
and
glorifying
god
but
suppose
at
that
very
moment
i
had
tried
all
that
and
cried
to
that
mountain
crush
these
tormentors
and
it
hadn
t
crushed
them
how
could
i
have
helped
doubting
pray
at
such
a
time
and
at
such
a
dread
hour
of
mortal
terror
and
apart
from
that
i
should
know
already
that
i
could
not
attain
to
the
fullness
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
since
the
mountain
had
not
moved
at
my
word
they
could
not
think
very
much
of
my
faith
up
aloft
and
there
could
be
no
very
great
reward
awaiting
me
in
the
world
to
come
so
why
should
i
let
them
flay
the
skin
off
me
as
well
and
to
no
good
purpose
for
even
though
they
had
flayed
my
skin
half
off
my
back
even
then
the
mountain
would
not
have
moved
at
my
word
or
at
my
cry
and
at
such
a
moment
not
only
doubt
might
come
over
one
but
one
might
lose
one
s
reason
from
fear
so
that
one
would
not
be
able
to
think
at
all
and
therefore
how
should
i
be
particularly
to
blame
if
not
seeing
my
advantage
or
reward
there
or
here
i
should
at
least
save
my
skin
and
so
trusting
fully
in
the
grace
of
the
lord
i
should
cherish
the
hope
that
i
might
be
altogether
forgiven
chapter
viii
over
the
brandy
the
controversy
was
over
but
strange
to
say
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
had
been
so
gay
suddenly
began
frowning
he
frowned
and
gulped
brandy
and
it
was
already
a
glass
too
much
get
along
with
you
jesuits
he
cried
to
the
servants
go
away
smerdyakov
i
ll
send
you
the
gold
piece
i
promised
you
to
day
but
be
off
don
t
cry
grigory
go
to
marfa
she
ll
comfort
you
and
put
you
to
bed
the
rascals
won
t
let
us
sit
in
peace
after
dinner
he
snapped
peevishly
as
the
servants
promptly
withdrew
at
his
word
smerdyakov
always
pokes
himself
in
now
after
dinner
it
s
you
he
s
so
interested
in
what
have
you
done
to
fascinate
him
he
added
to
ivan
nothing
whatever
answered
ivan
he
s
pleased
to
have
a
high
opinion
of
me
he
s
a
lackey
and
a
mean
soul
raw
material
for
revolution
however
when
the
time
comes
for
revolution
there
will
be
others
and
better
ones
but
there
will
be
some
like
him
as
well
his
kind
will
come
first
and
better
ones
after
and
when
will
the
time
come
the
rocket
will
go
off
and
fizzle
out
perhaps
the
peasants
are
not
very
fond
of
listening
to
these
soup
makers
so
far
ah
brother
but
a
balaam
s
ass
like
that
thinks
and
thinks
and
the
devil
knows
where
he
gets
to
he
s
storing
up
ideas
said
ivan
smiling
you
see
i
know
he
can
t
bear
me
nor
any
one
else
even
you
though
you
fancy
that
he
has
a
high
opinion
of
you
worse
still
with
alyosha
he
despises
alyosha
but
he
doesn
t
steal
that
s
one
thing
and
he
s
not
a
gossip
he
holds
his
tongue
and
doesn
t
wash
our
dirty
linen
in
public
he
makes
capital
fish
pasties
too
but
damn
him
is
he
worth
talking
about
so
much
of
course
he
isn
t
and
as
for
the
ideas
he
may
be
hatching
the
russian
peasant
generally
speaking
needs
thrashing
that
i
ve
always
maintained
our
peasants
are
swindlers
and
don
t
deserve
to
be
pitied
and
it
s
a
good
thing
they
re
still
flogged
sometimes
russia
is
rich
in
birches
if
they
destroyed
the
forests
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
russia
i
stand
up
for
the
clever
people
we
ve
left
off
thrashing
the
peasants
we
ve
grown
so
clever
but
they
go
on
thrashing
themselves
and
a
good
thing
too
for
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
or
how
does
it
go
anyhow
it
will
be
measured
but
russia
s
all
swinishness
my
dear
if
you
only
knew
how
i
hate
russia
that
is
not
russia
but
all
this
vice
but
maybe
i
mean
russia
tout
cela
c
est
de
la
cochonnerie
do
you
know
what
i
like
i
like
wit
you
ve
had
another
glass
that
s
enough
wait
a
bit
i
ll
have
one
more
and
then
another
and
then
i
ll
stop
no
stay
you
interrupted
me
at
mokroe
i
was
talking
to
an
old
man
and
he
told
me
there
s
nothing
we
like
so
much
as
sentencing
girls
to
be
thrashed
and
we
always
give
the
lads
the
job
of
thrashing
them
and
the
girl
he
has
thrashed
to
day
the
young
man
will
ask
in
marriage
to
morrow
so
it
quite
suits
the
girls
too
he
said
there
s
a
set
of
de
sades
for
you
but
it
s
clever
anyway
shall
we
go
over
and
have
a
look
at
it
eh
alyosha
are
you
blushing
don
t
be
bashful
child
i
m
sorry
i
didn
t
stay
to
dinner
at
the
superior
s
and
tell
the
monks
about
the
girls
at
mokroe
alyosha
don
t
be
angry
that
i
offended
your
superior
this
morning
i
lost
my
temper
if
there
is
a
god
if
he
exists
then
of
course
i
m
to
blame
and
i
shall
have
to
answer
for
it
but
if
there
isn
t
a
god
at
all
what
do
they
deserve
your
fathers
it
s
not
enough
to
cut
their
heads
off
for
they
keep
back
progress
would
you
believe
it
ivan
that
that
lacerates
my
sentiments
no
you
don
t
believe
it
as
i
see
from
your
eyes
you
believe
what
people
say
that
i
m
nothing
but
a
buffoon
alyosha
do
you
believe
that
i
m
nothing
but
a
buffoon
no
i
don
t
believe
it
and
i
believe
you
don
t
and
that
you
speak
the
truth
you
look
sincere
and
you
speak
sincerely
but
not
ivan
ivan
s
supercilious
i
d
make
an
end
of
your
monks
though
all
the
same
i
d
take
all
that
mystic
stuff
and
suppress
it
once
for
all
all
over
russia
so
as
to
bring
all
the
fools
to
reason
and
the
gold
and
the
silver
that
would
flow
into
the
mint
but
why
suppress
it
asked
ivan
that
truth
may
prevail
that
s
why
well
if
truth
were
to
prevail
you
know
you
d
be
the
first
to
be
robbed
and
suppressed
ah
i
dare
say
you
re
right
ah
i
m
an
ass
burst
out
fyodor
pavlovitch
striking
himself
lightly
on
the
forehead
well
your
monastery
may
stand
then
alyosha
if
that
s
how
it
is
and
we
clever
people
will
sit
snug
and
enjoy
our
brandy
you
know
ivan
it
must
have
been
so
ordained
by
the
almighty
himself
ivan
speak
is
there
a
god
or
not
stay
speak
the
truth
speak
seriously
why
are
you
laughing
again
i
m
laughing
that
you
should
have
made
a
clever
remark
just
now
about
smerdyakov
s
belief
in
the
existence
of
two
saints
who
could
move
mountains
why
am
i
like
him
now
then
very
much
well
that
shows
i
m
a
russian
too
and
i
have
a
russian
characteristic
and
you
may
be
caught
in
the
same
way
though
you
are
a
philosopher
shall
i
catch
you
what
do
you
bet
that
i
ll
catch
you
to
morrow
speak
all
the
same
is
there
a
god
or
not
only
be
serious
i
want
you
to
be
serious
now
no
there
is
no
god
alyosha
is
there
a
god
there
is
ivan
and
is
there
immortality
of
some
sort
just
a
little
just
a
tiny
bit
there
is
no
immortality
either
none
at
all
none
at
all
there
s
absolute
nothingness
then
perhaps
there
is
just
something
anything
is
better
than
nothing
absolute
nothingness
alyosha
is
there
immortality
there
is
god
and
immortality
god
and
immortality
in
god
is
immortality
h
m
it
s
more
likely
ivan
s
right
good
lord
to
think
what
faith
what
force
of
all
kinds
man
has
lavished
for
nothing
on
that
dream
and
for
how
many
thousand
years
who
is
it
laughing
at
man
ivan
for
the
last
time
once
for
all
is
there
a
god
or
not
i
ask
for
the
last
time
and
for
the
last
time
there
is
not
who
is
laughing
at
mankind
ivan
it
must
be
the
devil
said
ivan
smiling
and
the
devil
does
he
exist
no
there
s
no
devil
either
it
s
a
pity
damn
it
all
what
wouldn
t
i
do
to
the
man
who
first
invented
god
hanging
on
a
bitter
aspen
tree
would
be
too
good
for
him
there
would
have
been
no
civilization
if
they
hadn
t
invented
god
wouldn
t
there
have
been
without
god
no
and
there
would
have
been
no
brandy
either
but
i
must
take
your
brandy
away
from
you
anyway
stop
stop
stop
dear
boy
one
more
little
glass
i
ve
hurt
alyosha
s
feelings
you
re
not
angry
with
me
alyosha
my
dear
little
alexey
no
i
am
not
angry
i
know
your
thoughts
your
heart
is
better
than
your
head
my
heart
better
than
my
head
is
it
oh
lord
and
that
from
you
ivan
do
you
love
alyosha
yes
you
must
love
him
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
by
this
time
very
drunk
listen
alyosha
i
was
rude
to
your
elder
this
morning
but
i
was
excited
but
there
s
wit
in
that
elder
don
t
you
think
ivan
very
likely
there
is
there
is
il
y
a
du
piron
l
dedans
he
s
a
jesuit
a
russian
one
that
is
as
he
s
an
honorable
person
there
s
a
hidden
indignation
boiling
within
him
at
having
to
pretend
and
affect
holiness
but
of
course
he
believes
in
god
not
a
bit
of
it
didn
t
you
know
why
he
tells
every
one
so
himself
that
is
not
every
one
but
all
the
clever
people
who
come
to
him
he
said
straight
out
to
governor
schultz
not
long
ago
credo
but
i
don
t
know
in
what
really
he
really
did
but
i
respect
him
there
s
something
of
mephistopheles
about
him
or
rather
of
the
hero
of
our
time
arbenin
or
what
s
his
name
you
see
he
s
a
sensualist
he
s
such
a
sensualist
that
i
should
be
afraid
for
my
daughter
or
my
wife
if
she
went
to
confess
to
him
you
know
when
he
begins
telling
stories
the
year
before
last
he
invited
us
to
tea
tea
with
liqueur
the
ladies
send
him
liqueur
and
began
telling
us
about
old
times
till
we
nearly
split
our
sides
especially
how
he
once
cured
a
paralyzed
woman
if
my
legs
were
not
bad
i
know
a
dance
i
could
dance
you
he
said
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
ve
plenty
of
tricks
in
my
time
said
he
he
did
dernidov
the
merchant
out
of
sixty
thousand
what
he
stole
it
he
brought
him
the
money
as
a
man
he
could
trust
saying
take
care
of
it
for
me
friend
there
ll
be
a
police
search
at
my
place
to
morrow
and
he
kept
it
you
have
given
it
to
the
church
he
declared
i
said
to
him
you
re
a
scoundrel
i
said
no
said
he
i
m
not
a
scoundrel
but
i
m
broad
minded
but
that
wasn
t
he
that
was
some
one
else
i
ve
muddled
him
with
some
one
else
without
noticing
it
come
another
glass
and
that
s
enough
take
away
the
bottle
ivan
i
ve
been
telling
lies
why
didn
t
you
stop
me
ivan
and
tell
me
i
was
lying
i
knew
you
d
stop
of
yourself
that
s
a
lie
you
did
it
from
spite
from
simple
spite
against
me
you
despise
me
you
have
come
to
me
and
despised
me
in
my
own
house
well
i
m
going
away
you
ve
had
too
much
brandy
i
ve
begged
you
for
christ
s
sake
to
go
to
tchermashnya
for
a
day
or
two
and
you
don
t
go
i
ll
go
to
morrow
if
you

so
set
upon
it

won
t
go

want
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
that
s
what
you
want
spiteful
fellow
that
s
why
you
won
t
go
the
old
man
persisted
he
had
reached
that
state
of
drunkenness
when
the
drunkard
who
has
till
then
been
inoffensive
tries
to
pick
a
quarrel
and
to
assert
himself
why
are
you
looking
at
me
why
do
you
look
like
that
your
eyes
look
at
me
and
say
you
ugly
drunkard
your
eyes
are
mistrustful
they
re
contemptuous
you
ve
come
here
with
some
design
alyosha
here
looks
at
me
and
his
eyes
shine
alyosha
doesn
t
despise
me
alexey
you
mustn
t
love
ivan
don
t
be
ill
tempered
with
my
brother
leave
off
attacking
him
alyosha
said
emphatically
oh
all
right
ugh
my
head
aches
take
away
the
brandy
ivan
it
s
the
third
time
i
ve
told
you
he
mused
and
suddenly
a
slow
cunning
grin
spread
over
his
face
don
t
be
angry
with
a
feeble
old
man
ivan
i
know
you
don
t
love
me
but
don
t
be
angry
all
the
same
you
ve
nothing
to
love
me
for
you
go
to
tchermashnya
i
ll
come
to
you
myself
and
bring
you
a
present
i
ll
show
you
a
little
wench
there
i
ve
had
my
eye
on
her
a
long
time
she
s
still
running
about
bare
foot
don
t
be
afraid
of
bare
footed
wenches
don
t
despise
them
they
re
pearls
and
he
kissed
his
hand
with
a
smack
to
my
thinking
he
revived
at
once
seeming
to
grow
sober
the
instant
he
touched
on
his
favorite
topic
to
my
thinking
ah
you
boys
you
children
little
sucking
pigs
to
my
thinking
i
never
thought
a
woman
ugly
in
my
life
that
s
been
my
rule
can
you
understand
that
how
could
you
understand
it
you
ve
milk
in
your
veins
not
blood
you
re
not
out
of
your
shells
yet
my
rule
has
been
that
you
can
always
find
something
devilishly
interesting
in
every
woman
that
you
wouldn
t
find
in
any
other
only
one
must
know
how
to
find
it
that
s
the
point
that
s
a
talent
to
my
mind
there
are
no
ugly
women
the
very
fact
that
she
is
a
woman
is
half
the
battle
but
how
could
you
understand
that
even
in
vieilles
filles
even
in
them
you
may
discover
something
that
makes
you
simply
wonder
that
men
have
been
such
fools
as
to
let
them
grow
old
without
noticing
them
bare
footed
girls
or
unattractive
ones
you
must
take
by
surprise
didn

that
you
must
astound
them
till
they
re
fascinated
upset
ashamed
that
such
a
gentleman
should
fall
in
love
with
such
a
little
slut
it
s
a
jolly
good
thing
that
there
always
are
and
will
be
masters
and
slaves
in

world
so
there

stay
listen
alyosha
i
always
used
to
surprise
your
mother
but
in
a
different
way
i
paid
no
attention
to
her
at
all
but
all
at
once
when
the
minute
came
i
d
be
all
devotion
to
her
crawl
on
my
knees
kiss
her
feet
and
i
always
always
i
remember
it
as
though
it
were
to
day
reduced
her
to
that
tinkling
quiet
nervous
queer
little
laugh
it
was
peculiar
to
her
i
knew
her
attacks
always
used
to
begin
like
that
the
next
day
she
would
begin
shrieking
hysterically
and
this
little
laugh
was
not
a
sign
of
delight
though
it
made
a
very
good
counterfeit
that
s
the
great
thing
to
know
how
to
take
every
one
once
belyavsky
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
and
rich
used
to
like
to
come
here
and
hang
about
her
suddenly
gave
me
a
slap
in
the
face
in
her
presence
and
she
such
a
mild
sheep
why
i
thought
she
would
have
knocked
me
down
for
that
blow
how
she
set
on
me
you
re
beaten
beaten
now
she
said
you
ve
taken
a
blow
from
him
you
have
been
trying
to
sell
me
to
him
she
said
and
how
dared
he
strike
you
in
my
presence
don
t
dare
come
near
me
again
never
never
run
at
once
challenge
him
to
a
duel
i
took
her
to
the
monastery
then
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
the
holy
fathers
prayed
her
back
to
reason
but
i
swear
by
god
alyosha
i
never
insulted
the
poor
crazy
girl
only
once
perhaps
in
the
first
year
then
she
was
very
fond
of
praying
she
used
to
keep
the
feasts
of
our
lady
particularly
and
used
to
turn
me
out
of
her
room
then
i
ll
knock
that
mysticism
out
of
her
thought
i
here
said
i
you
see
your
holy
image
here
it
is
here
i
take
it
down
you
believe
it
s
miraculous
but
here
i
ll
spit
on
it
directly
and
nothing
will
happen
to
me
for
it
when
she
saw
it
good
lord
i
thought
she
would
kill
me
but
she
only
jumped
up
wrung
her
hands
then
suddenly
hid
her
face
in
them
began
trembling
all
over
and
fell
on
the
floor
fell
all
of
a
heap
alyosha
alyosha
what
s
the
matter
the
old
man
jumped
up
in
alarm
from
the
time
he
had
begun
speaking
about
his
mother
a
change
had
gradually
come
over
alyosha
s
face
he
flushed
crimson
his
eyes
glowed
his
lips
quivered
the
old
sot
had
gone
spluttering
on
noticing
nothing
till
the
moment
when
something
very
strange
happened
to
alyosha
precisely
what
he
was
describing
in
the
crazy
woman
was
suddenly
repeated
with
alyosha
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
exactly
as
his
mother
was
said
to
have
done
wrung
his
hands
hid
his
face
in
them
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
shaking
all
over
in
an
hysterical
paroxysm
of
sudden
violent
silent
weeping
his
extraordinary
resemblance
to
his
mother
particularly
impressed
the
old
man
ivan
ivan
water
quickly
it
s
like
her
exactly
as
she
used
to
be
then
his
mother
spurt
some
water
on
him
from
your
mouth
that
s
what
i
used
to
do
to
her
he
s
upset
about
his
mother
his
mother
he
muttered
to
ivan
but
she
was
my
mother
too
i
believe
his
mother
was
she
not
said
ivan
with
uncontrolled
anger
and
contempt
the
old
man
shrank
before
his
flashing
eyes
but
something
very
strange
had
happened
though
only
for
a
second
it
seemed
really
to
have
escaped
the
old
man
s
mind
that
alyosha
s
mother
actually
was
the
mother
of
ivan
too
your
mother
he
muttered
not
understanding
what
do
you
mean
what
mother
are
you
talking
about
was
she
why
damn
it
of
course
she
was
yours
too
damn
it
my
mind
has
never
been
so
darkened
before
excuse
me
why
i
was
thinking
ivan
he
he
he
he
stopped
a
broad
drunken
half
senseless
grin
overspread
his
face
at
that
moment
a
fearful
noise
and
clamor
was
heard
in
the
hall
there
were
violent
shouts
the
door
was
flung
open
and
dmitri
burst
into
the
room
the
old
man
rushed
to
ivan
in
terror
he
ll
kill
me
he
ll
kill
me
don
t
let
him
get
at
me
he
screamed
clinging
to
the
skirt
of
ivan
s
coat
chapter
ix
the
sensualists
grigory
and
smerdyakov
ran
into
the
room
after
dmitri
they
had
been
struggling
with
him
in
the
passage
refusing
to
admit
him
acting
on
instructions
given
them
by
fyodor
pavlovitch
some
days
before
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
dmitri
stopped
a
moment
on
entering
the
room
to
look
about
him
grigory
ran
round
the
table
closed
the
double
doors
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
leading
to
the
inner
apartments
and
stood
before
the
closed
doors
stretching
wide
his
arms
prepared
to
defend
the
entrance
so
to
speak
with
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
seeing
this
dmitri
uttered
a
scream
rather
than
a
shout
and
rushed
at
grigory
then
she
s
there
she
s
hidden
there
out
of
the
way
scoundrel
he
tried
to
pull
grigory
away
but
the
old
servant
pushed
him
back
beside
himself
with
fury
dmitri
struck
out
and
hit
grigory
with
all
his
might
the
old
man
fell
like
a
log
and
dmitri
leaping
over
him
broke
in
the
door
smerdyakov
remained
pale
and
trembling
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
huddling
close
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
she
s
here
shouted
dmitri
i
saw
her
turn
towards
the
house
just
now
but
i
couldn
t
catch
her
where
is
she
where
is
she
that
shout
she
s
here
produced
an
indescribable
effect
on
fyodor
pavlovitch
all
his
terror
left
him
hold
him
hold
him
he
cried
and
dashed
after
dmitri
meanwhile
grigory
had
got
up
from
the
floor
but
still
seemed
stunned
ivan
and
alyosha
ran
after
their
father
in
the
third
room
something
was
heard
to
fall
on
the
floor
with
a
ringing
crash
it
was
a
large
glass
vase
not
an
expensive
one
on
a
marble
pedestal
which
dmitri
had
upset
as
he
ran
past
it
at
him
shouted
the
old
man
help
ivan
and
alyosha
caught
the
old
man
and
were
forcibly
bringing
him
back
why
do
you
run
after
him
he
ll
murder
you
outright
ivan
cried
wrathfully
at
his
father
ivan
alyosha
she
must
be
here
grushenka
s
here
he
said
he
saw
her
himself
running
he
was
choking
he
was
not
expecting
grushenka
at
the
time
and
the
sudden
news
that
she
was
here
made
him
beside
himself
he
was
trembling
all
over
he
seemed
frantic
but
you
ve
seen
for
yourself
that
she
hasn
t
come
cried
ivan
but
she
may
have
come
by
that
other
entrance
you
know
that
entrance
is
locked
and
you
have
the
key
dmitri
suddenly
reappeared
in
the
drawing
room
he
had
of
course
found
the
other
entrance
locked
and
the
key
actually
was
in
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
pocket
the
windows
of
all
the
rooms
were
also
closed
so
grushenka
could
not
have
come
in
anywhere
nor
have
run
out
anywhere
hold
him
shrieked
fyodor
pavlovitch
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
again
he
s
been
stealing
money
in
my
bedroom
and
tearing
himself
from
ivan
he
rushed
again
at
dmitri
but
dmitri
threw
up
both
hands
and
suddenly
clutched
the
old
man
by
the
two
tufts
of
hair
that
remained
on
his
temples
tugged
at
them
and
flung
him
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
he
kicked
him
two
or
three
times
with
his
heel
in
the
face
the
old
man
moaned
shrilly
ivan
though
not
so
strong
as
dmitri
threw
his
arms
round
him
and
with
all
his
might
pulled
him
away
alyosha
helped
him
with
his
slender
strength
holding
dmitri
in
front
madman

ve
killed
him
cried
ivan
serve
him
right
shouted
dmitri
breathlessly

again
and

protect
him
dmitri

alyosha
commandingly
alexey

and
farewell
describe
the
scene
to
her
meanwhile
ivan
and
grigory
had
raised
the
old
man
and
seated
him
in
an
arm
chair
his
face
was
covered
with
blood
but
he
was
conscious
and
listened
greedily
to
dmitri
s
cries
he
was
still
fancying
that
grushenka
really
was
somewhere
in
the
house
dmitri
looked
at
him
with
hatred
as
he
went
out
i
don
t
repent
shedding
your
blood
he
cried
beware
old
man
beware
of
your
dream
for
i
have
my
dream
too
i
curse
you
and
disown
you
altogether
he
ran
out
of
the
room
she
s
here
she
must
be
here
smerdyakov
smerdyakov
the
old
man
wheezed
scarcely
audibly
beckoning
to
him
with
his
finger
no

old
lunatic
ivan
shouted
at
him
angrily

smerdyakov
smerdyakov
ran
for
water
at
last
they
got
the
old
man
undressed
and
put
him
to
bed
they
wrapped
a
wet
towel
round
his
head
exhausted
by
the
brandy
by
his
violent
emotion
and
the
blows
he
had
received
he
shut
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
ivan
and
alyosha
went
back
to
the
drawing
room
smerdyakov
removed
the
fragments
of
the
broken
vase
while
grigory
stood
by
the
table
looking
gloomily
at
the
floor
shouldn
t
you
put
a
wet
bandage
on
your
head
and
go
to
bed
too
alyosha
said
to
him
we
ll
look
after
him
my
brother
gave
you
a
terrible
blow
on
the
head
he
s
insulted
me
grigory
articulated
gloomily
and
distinctly
he
s
insulted
his
father
not
only
you
observed
ivan
with
a
forced
smile
i
used
to
wash
him
in
his
tub
he
s
insulted
me
repeated
grigory
damn
it
all
if
i
hadn
t
pulled
him
away
perhaps
he
d
have
murdered
him
it
wouldn
t
take
much
to
do
for
sop
would
it
whispered
ivan
to
alyosha
god
forbid
cried
alyosha
why
should
he
forbid
ivan
went
on
in
the
same
whisper
with
a
malignant
grimace
one
reptile
will
devour
the
other
and
serve
them
both
right
too
alyosha
shuddered
of
course
i
won
t
let
him
be
murdered
as
i
didn
t
just
now
stay
here
alyosha
i
ll
go
for
a
turn
in
the
yard
my
head
s
begun
to
ache
alyosha
went
to
his
father
s
bedroom
and
sat
by
his
bedside
behind
the
screen
for
about
an
hour
the
old
man
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
for
a
long
while
at
alyosha
evidently
remembering
and
meditating
all
at
once
his
face
betrayed
extraordinary
excitement
alyosha
he
whispered
apprehensively
where
s
ivan
in
the
yard
he
s
got
a
headache
he
s
on
the
watch
give
me
that
looking
glass

stands
over
there
give
it
me
alyosha
gave
him
a
little
round
folding
looking
glass
which
stood
on
the
chest
of
drawers
the
old
man
looked
at
himself
in
it
his
nose
was
considerably
swollen
and
on
the
left
side
of
his
forehead
there
was
a
rather
large
crimson
bruise
what

ivan
say
alyosha

the
old
man
fairly
fluttered
with
joy
as
though
nothing
more
comforting
could
have
been
said
to
him
in
his
delight
he
seized
alyosha
s
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
to
his
heart
tears
positively
glittered
in
his
eyes
that
image
of
the
mother
of
god
of
which
i
was
telling
you
just

said

now
and
part
of
what
went
before
dmitri
has
asked
you
to
go
to
her
and
say
that
he
well
in
fact
takes
his
leave
of
her
brother
how
will
all
this
horror
end
between
father
and
dmitri
exclaimed
alyosha
one
can
t
tell
for
certain
perhaps
in
nothing
it
may
all
fizzle
out
that
woman
is
a
beast
in
any
case
we
must
keep
the
old
man
indoors
and
not
let
dmitri
in
the
house
brother
let
me
ask
one
thing
more
has
any
man
a
right
to
look
at
other
men
and
decide
which
is
worthy
to
live
why
bring
in
the
question
of
worth
the
matter
is
most
often
decided
in
men
s
hearts
on
other
grounds
much
more
natural
and
as
for
rights
who
has
not
the
right
to
wish
not
for
another
man
s
death
what
even
if
for
another
man
s
death
why
lie
to
oneself
since
all
men
live
so
and
perhaps
cannot
help
living
so
are
you
referring
to
what
i
said
just
now
that
one
reptile
will
devour
the
other
in
that
case
let
me
ask
you
do
you
think
me
like
dmitri
capable
of
shedding
sop
s
blood
murdering
him
eh
what
are
you
saying
ivan
such
an
idea
never
crossed
my
mind
i
don
t
think
dmitri
is
capable
of
it
either
thanks
if
only
for
that
smiled
ivan
be
sure
i
should
always
defend
him
but
in
my
wishes
i
reserve
myself
full
latitude
in
this
case
good
by
till
to
morrow
don
t
condemn
me
and
don
t
look
on
me
as
a
villain
he
added
with
a
smile
they
shook
hands
warmly
as
they
had
never
done
before
alyosha
felt
that
his
brother
had
taken
the
first
step
towards
him
and
that
he
had
certainly
done
this
with
some
definite
motive
chapter
x
both
together
alyosha
left
his
father
s
house
feeling
even
more
exhausted
and
dejected
in
spirit
than
when
he
had
entered
it
his
mind
too
seemed
shattered
and
unhinged
while
he
felt
that
he
was
afraid
to
put
together
the
disjointed
fragments
and
form
a
general
idea
from
all
the
agonizing
and
conflicting
experiences
of
the
day
he
felt
something
bordering
upon
despair
which
he
had
never
known
till
then
towering
like
a
mountain
above
all
the
rest
stood
the
fatal
insoluble
question
how
would
things
end
between
his
father
and
his
brother
dmitri
with
this
terrible
woman
now
he
had
himself
been
a
witness
of
it
he
had
been
present
and
seen
them
face
to
face
yet
only
his
brother
dmitri
could
be
made
unhappy
terribly
completely
unhappy
there
was
trouble
awaiting
him
it
appeared
too
that
there
were
other
people
concerned
far
more
so
than
alyosha
could
have
supposed
before
there
was
something
positively
mysterious
in
it
too
ivan
had
made
a
step
towards
him
which
was
what
alyosha
had
been
long
desiring
yet
now
he
felt
for
some
reason
that
he
was
frightened
at
it
and
these
women
strange
to
say
that
morning
he
had
set
out
for
katerina
ivanovna
s
in
the
greatest
embarrassment
now
he
felt
nothing
of
the
kind
on
the
contrary
he
was
hastening
there
as
though
expecting
to
find
guidance
from
her
yet
to
give
her
this
message
was
obviously
more
difficult
than
before
the
matter
of
the
three
thousand
was
decided
irrevocably
and
dmitri
feeling
himself
dishonored
and
losing
his
last
hope
might
sink
to
any
depth
he
had
moreover
told
him
to
describe
to
katerina
ivanovna
the
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
with
his
father
it
was
by
now
seven
o
clock
and
it
was
getting
dark
as
alyosha
entered
the
very
spacious
and
convenient
house
in
the
high
street
occupied
by
katerina
ivanovna
alyosha
knew
that
she
lived
with
two
aunts
one
of
them
a
woman
of
little
education
was
that
aunt
of
her
half
sister
agafya
ivanovna
who
had
looked
after
her
in
her
father
s
house
when
she
came
from
boarding
school
the
other
aunt
was
a
moscow
lady
of
style
and
consequence
though
in
straitened
circumstances
it
was
said
that
they
both
gave
way
in
everything
to
katerina
ivanovna
and
that
she
only
kept
them
with
her
as
chaperons
katerina
ivanovna
herself
gave
way
to
no
one
but
her
benefactress
the
general
s
widow
who
had
been
kept
by
illness
in
moscow
and
to
whom
she
was
obliged
to
write
twice
a
week
a
full
account
of
all
her
doings
when
alyosha
entered
the
hall
and
asked
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
to
him
to
take
his
name
up
it
was
evident
that
they
were
already
aware
of
his
arrival
possibly
he
had
been
noticed
from
the
window
at
least
alyosha
heard
a
noise
caught
the
sound
of
flying
footsteps
and
rustling
skirts
two
or
three
women
perhaps
had
run
out
of
the
room
alyosha
thought
it
strange
that
his
arrival
should
cause
such
excitement
he
was
conducted
however
to
the
drawing
room
at
once
it
was
a
large
room
elegantly
and
amply
furnished
not
at
all
in
provincial
style
there
were
many
sofas
lounges
settees
big
and
little
tables
there
were
pictures
on
the
walls
vases
and
lamps
on
the
tables
masses
of
flowers
and
even
an
aquarium
in
the
window
it
was
twilight
and
rather
dark
alyosha
made
out
a
silk
mantle
thrown
down
on
the
sofa
where
people
had
evidently
just
been
sitting
and
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
were
two
unfinished
cups
of
chocolate
cakes
a
glass
saucer
with
blue
raisins
and
another
with
sweetmeats
alyosha
saw
that
he
had
interrupted
visitors
and
frowned
but
at
that
instant
the
porti
re
was
raised
and
with
rapid
hurrying
footsteps
katerina
ivanovna
came
in
holding
out
both
hands
to
alyosha
with
a
radiant
smile
of
delight
at
the
same
instant
a
servant
brought
in
two
lighted
candles
and
set
them
on
the
table
thank
god
at
last
you
have
come
too
i
ve
been
simply
praying
for
you
all
day
sit
down
alyosha
had
been
struck
by
katerina
ivanovna
s
beauty
when
three
weeks
before
dmitri
had
first
brought
him
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
special
request
to
be
introduced
to
her
there
had
been
no
conversation
between
them
at
that
interview
however
supposing
alyosha
to
be
very
shy
katerina
ivanovna
had
talked
all
the
time
to
dmitri
to
spare
him
alyosha
had
been
silent
but
he
had
seen
a
great
deal
very
clearly
he
was
struck
by
the
imperiousness
proud
ease
and
self
confidence
of
the
haughty
girl
and
all
that
was
certain
alyosha
felt
that
he
was
not
exaggerating
it
he
thought
her
great
glowing
black
eyes
were
very
fine
especially
with
her
pale
even
rather
sallow
longish
face
but
in
those
eyes
and
in
the
lines
of
her
exquisite
lips
there
was
something
with
which
his
brother
might
well
be
passionately
in
love
but
which
perhaps
could
not
be
loved
for
long
he
expressed
this
thought
almost
plainly
to
dmitri
when
after
the
visit
his
brother
besought
and
insisted
that
he
should
not
conceal
his
impressions
on
seeing
his
betrothed
you
ll
be
happy
with
her
but
perhaps
not
tranquilly
happy
quite
so
brother
such
people
remain
always
the
same
they
don
t
yield
to
fate
so
you
think
i
shan
t
love
her
for
ever
no
perhaps
you
will
love
her
for
ever
but
perhaps
you
won
t
always
be
happy
with
her
alyosha
had
given
his
opinion
at
the
time
blushing
and
angry
with
himself
for
having
yielded
to
his
brother
s
entreaties
and
put
such
foolish
ideas
into
words
for
his
opinion
had
struck
him
as
awfully
foolish
immediately
after
he
had
uttered
it
he
felt
ashamed
too
of
having
given
so
confident
an
opinion
about
a
woman
it
was
with
the
more
amazement
that
he
felt
now
at
the
first
glance
at
katerina
ivanovna
as
she
ran
in
to
him
that
he
had
perhaps
been
utterly
mistaken
this
time
her
face
was
beaming
with
spontaneous
good
natured
kindliness
and
direct
warm
hearted
sincerity
the
pride
and
haughtiness
which
had
struck
alyosha
so
much
before
was
only
betrayed
now
in
a
frank
generous
energy
and
a
sort
of
bright
strong
faith
in
herself
alyosha
realized
at
the
first
glance
at
the
first
word
that
all
the
tragedy
of
her
position
in
relation
to
the
man
she
loved
so
dearly
was
no
secret
to
her
that
she
perhaps
already
knew
everything
positively
everything
and
yet
in
spite
of
that
there
was
such
brightness
in
her
face
such
faith
in
the
future
alyosha
felt
at
once
that
he
had
gravely
wronged
her
in
his
thoughts
he
was
conquered
and
captivated
immediately
besides
all
this
he
noticed
at
her
first
words
that
she
was
in
great
excitement
an
excitement
perhaps
quite
exceptional
and
almost
approaching
ecstasy
i
was
so
eager
to
see
you
because
i
can
learn
from
you
the
whole
truth
from
you
and
no
one
else
i
have
come
muttered
alyosha
confusedly
i
he
sent
me
ah
he
sent
you
i
foresaw
that
now
i
know
everything
everything
cried
katerina
ivanovna
her
eyes
flashing
wait
a
moment
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
ve
been
so
longing
to
see
you
you
see
i
know
perhaps
far
more
than
you
do
yourself
and
there
s
no
need
for
you
to
tell
me
anything
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
want
from
you
i
want
to
know
your
own
last
impression
of
him
i
want
you
to
tell
me
most
directly
plainly
coarsely
even
oh
as
coarsely
as
you
like
what
you
thought
of
him
just
now
and
of
his
position
after
your
meeting
with
him
to
day
that
will
perhaps
be
better
than
if
i
had
a
personal
explanation
with
him
as
he
does
not
want
to
come
to
me
do
you
understand
what
i
want
from
you
now
tell
me
simply
tell
me
every
word
of
the
message
he
sent
you
with
i
knew
he
would
send
you
he
told
me
to
give
you
his
compliments
and
to
say
that
he
would
never
come
again
but
to
give
you
his
compliments
his
compliments
was
that
what
he
said
his
own
expression
yes
accidentally
perhaps
he
made
a
mistake
in
the
word
perhaps
he
did
not
use
the
right
word
no
he
told
me
precisely
to
repeat
that
word
he
begged
me
two
or
three
times
not
to
forget
to
say
so
katerina
ivanovna
flushed
hotly
help
me
now
alexey
fyodorovitch
now
i
really
need
your
help
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
think
and
you
must
simply
say
whether
it
s
right
or
not
listen
if
he
had
sent
me
his
compliments
in
passing
without
insisting
on
your
repeating
the
words
without
emphasizing
them
that
would
be
the
end
of
everything
but
if
he
particularly
insisted
on
those
words
if
he
particularly
told
you
not
to
forget
to
repeat
them
to
me
then
perhaps
he
was
in
excitement
beside
himself
he
had
made
his
decision
and
was
frightened
at
it
he
wasn
t
walking
away
from
me
with
a
resolute
step
but
leaping
headlong
the
emphasis
on
that
phrase
may
have
been
simply
bravado
yes
yes
cried
alyosha
warmly
i
believe
that
is
it
and
if
so
he
s
not
altogether
lost
i
can
still
save
him
stay
did
he
not
tell
you
anything
about
money
about
three
thousand
roubles
he
did
speak
about
it
and
it
s
that
more
than
anything
that
s
crushing
him
he
said
he
had
lost
his
honor
and
that
nothing
matters
now
alyosha
answered
warmly
feeling
a
rush
of
hope
in
his
heart
and
believing
that
there
really
might
be
a
way
of
escape
and
salvation
for
his
brother
but
do
you
know
about
the
money
he
added
and
suddenly
broke
off
i
ve
known
of
it
a
long
time
i
telegraphed
to
moscow
to
inquire
and
heard
long
ago
that
the
money
had
not
arrived
he
hadn
t
sent
the
money
but
i
said
nothing
last
week
i
learnt
that
he
was
still
in
need
of
money
my
only
object
in
all
this
was
that
he
should
know
to
whom
to
turn
and
who
was
his
true
friend
no
he
won
t
recognize
that
i
am
his
truest
friend
he
won
t
know
me
and
looks
on
me
merely
as
a
woman
i
ve
been
tormented
all
the
week
trying
to
think
how
to
prevent
him
from
being
ashamed
to
face
me
because
he
spent
that
three
thousand
let
him
feel
ashamed
of
himself
let
him
be
ashamed
of
other
people
s
knowing
but
not
of
my
knowing
he
can
tell
god
everything
without
shame
why
is
it
he
still
does
not
understand
how
much
i
am
ready
to
bear
for
his
sake
why
why
doesn
t
he
know
me
how
dare
he
not
know
me
after
all
that
has
happened
i
want
to
save
him
for
ever
let
him
forget
me
as
his
betrothed
and
here
he
fears
that
he
is
dishonored
in
my
eyes
why
he
wasn
t
afraid
to
be
open
with
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
how
is
it
that
i
don
t
deserve
the
same
the
last
words
she
uttered
in
tears
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
i
must
tell
you
alyosha
began
his
voice
trembling
too
what
happened
just
now
between
him
and
my
father
and
he
described
the
whole
scene
how
dmitri
had
sent
him
to
get
the
money
how
he
had
broken
in
knocked
his
father
down
and
after
that
had
again
specially
and
emphatically
begged
him
to
take
his
compliments
and
farewell
he
went
to
that
woman
alyosha
added
softly
and
do
you
suppose
that
i
can
t
put
up
with
that
woman
does
he
think
i
can
t
but
he
won
t
marry
her
she
suddenly
laughed
nervously
could
such
a
passion
last
for
ever
in
a
karamazov
it
s
passion
not
love
he
won
t
marry
her
because
she
won
t
marry
him
again
katerina
ivanovna
laughed
strangely
he
may
marry
her
said
alyosha
mournfully
looking
down
he
won
t
marry
her
i
tell
you
that
girl
is
an
angel
do
you
know
that
do
you
know
that
katerina
ivanovna
exclaimed
suddenly
with
extraordinary
warmth
she
is
one
of
the
most
fantastic
of
fantastic
creatures
i
know
how
bewitching
she
is
but
i
know
too
that
she
is
kind
firm
and
noble
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
alexey
fyodorovitch
perhaps
you
are
wondering
at
my
words
perhaps
you
don
t
believe
me
agrafena
alexandrovna
my
angel
she
cried
suddenly
to
some
one
peeping
into
the
next
room
come
in
to
us
this
is
a
friend
this
is
alyosha
he
knows
all
about
our
affairs
show
yourself
to
him
i
ve
only
been
waiting
behind
the
curtain
for
you
to
call
me
said
a
soft
one
might
even
say
sugary
feminine
voice
the
porti
re
was
raised
and
grushenka
herself
smiling
and
beaming
came
up
to
the
table
a
violent
revulsion
passed
over
alyosha
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
and
could
not
take
them
off
here
she
was
that
awful
woman
the
beast
as
ivan
had
called
her
half
an
hour
before
and
yet
one
would
have
thought
the
creature
standing
before
him
most
simple
and
ordinary
a
good
natured
kind
woman
handsome
certainly
but
so
like
other
handsome
ordinary
women
it
is
true
she
was
very
very
good
looking
with
that
russian
beauty
so
passionately
loved
by
many
men
she
was
a
rather
tall
woman
though
a
little
shorter
than
katerina
ivanovna
who
was
exceptionally
tall
she
had
a
full
figure
with
soft
as
it
were
noiseless
movements
softened
to
a
peculiar
over
sweetness
like
her
voice
she
moved
not
like
katerina
ivanovna
with
a
vigorous
bold
step
but
noiselessly
her
feet
made
absolutely
no
sound
on
the
floor
she
sank
softly
into
a
low
chair
softly
rustling
her
sumptuous
black
silk
dress
and
delicately
nestling
her
milk
white
neck
and
broad
shoulders
in
a
costly
cashmere
shawl
she
was
twenty
two
years
old
and
her
face
looked
exactly
that
age
she
was
very
white
in
the
face
with
a
pale
pink
tint
on
her
cheeks
the
modeling
of
her
face
might
be
said
to
be
too
broad
and
the
lower
jaw
was
set
a
trifle
forward
her
upper
lip
was
thin
but
the
slightly
prominent
lower
lip
was
at
least
twice
as
full
and
looked
pouting
but
her
magnificent
abundant
dark
brown
hair
her
sable
colored
eyebrows
and
charming
gray
blue
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
would
have
made
the
most
indifferent
person
meeting
her
casually
in
a
crowd
in
the
street
stop
at
the
sight
of
her
face
and
remember
it
long
after
what
struck
alyosha
most
in
that
face
was
its
expression
of
childlike
good
nature
there
was
a
childlike
look
in
her
eyes
a
look
of
childish
delight
she
came
up
to
the
table
beaming
with
delight
and
seeming
to
expect
something
with
childish
impatient
and
confiding
curiosity
the
light
in
her
eyes
gladdened
the
soul
alyosha
felt
that
there
was
something
else
in
her
which
he
could
not
understand
or
would
not
have
been
able
to
define
and
which
yet
perhaps
unconsciously
affected
him
it
was
that
softness
that
voluptuousness
of
her
bodily
movements
that
catlike
noiselessness
yet
it
was
a
vigorous
ample
body
under
the
shawl
could
be
seen
full
broad
shoulders
a
high
still
quite
girlish
bosom
her
figure
suggested
the
lines
of
the
venus
of
milo
though
already
in
somewhat
exaggerated
proportions
that
could
be
divined
connoisseurs
of
russian
beauty
could
have
foretold
with
certainty
that
this
fresh
still
youthful
beauty
would
lose
its
harmony
by
the
age
of
thirty
would
spread
that
the
face
would
become
puffy
and
that
wrinkles
would
very
soon
appear
upon
her
forehead
and
round
the
eyes
the
complexion
would
grow
coarse
and
red
perhaps
in
fact
that
it
was
the
beauty
of
the
moment
the
fleeting
beauty
which
is
so
often
met
with
in
russian
women
alyosha
of
course
did
not
think
of
this
but
though
he
was
fascinated
yet
he
wondered
with
an
unpleasant
sensation
and
as
it
were
regretfully
why
she
drawled
in
that
way
and
could
not
speak
naturally
she
did
so
evidently
feeling
there
was
a
charm
in
the
exaggerated
honeyed
modulation
of
the
syllables
it
was
of
course
only
a
bad
underbred
habit
that
showed
bad
education
and
a
false
idea
of
good
manners
and
yet
this
intonation
and
manner
of
speaking
impressed
alyosha
as
almost
incredibly
incongruous
with
the
childishly
simple
and
happy
expression
of
her
face
the
soft
babyish
joy
in
her
eyes
katerina
ivanovna
at
once
made
her
sit
down
in
an
arm
chair
facing
alyosha
and
ecstatically
kissed
her
several
times
on
her
smiling
lips
she
seemed
quite
in
love
with
her
this
is
the
first
time
we
ve
met
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
said
rapturously
i
wanted
to
know
her
to
see
her
i
wanted
to
go
to
her
but
i
d
no
sooner
expressed
the
wish
than
she
came
to
me
i
knew
we
should
settle
everything
together
everything
my
heart
told
me
so
i
was
begged
not
to
take
the
step
but
i
foresaw
it
would
be
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
i
was
not
mistaken
grushenka
has
explained
everything
to
me
told
me
all
she
means
to
do
she
flew
here
like
an
angel
of
goodness
and
brought
us
peace
and
joy
you
did
not
disdain
me
sweet
excellent
young
lady
drawled
grushenka
in
her
sing
song
voice
still
with
the
same
charming
smile
of
delight
don
t
dare
to
speak
to
me
like
that
you
sorceress
you
witch
disdain
you
here
i
must
kiss
your
lower
lip
once
more
it
looks
as
though
it
were
swollen
and
now
it
will
be
more
so
and
more
and
more
look
how
she
laughs
alexey
fyodorovitch
it
does
one
s
heart
good
to
see
the
angel
alyosha
flushed
and
faint
imperceptible
shivers
kept
running
down
him
you
make
so
much
of
me
dear
young
lady
and
perhaps
i
am
not
at
all
worthy
of
your
kindness
not
worthy
she
s
not
worthy
of
it
katerina
ivanovna
cried
again
with
the
same
warmth
you
know
alexey
fyodorovitch
we
re
fanciful
we
re
self
willed
but
proudest
of
the
proud
in
our
little
heart
we
re
noble
we
re
generous
alexey
fyodorovitch
let
me
tell
you
we
have
only
been
unfortunate
we
were
too
ready
to
make
every
sacrifice
for
an
unworthy
perhaps
or
fickle
man
there
was
one
man
one
an
officer
too
we
loved
him
we
sacrificed
everything
to
him
that
was
long
ago
five
years
ago
and
he
has
forgotten
us
he
has
married
now
he
is
a
widower
he
has
written
he
is
coming
here
and
do
you
know
we
ve
loved
him
none
but
him
all
this
time
and
we
ve
loved
him
all
our
life
he
will
come
and
grushenka
will
be
happy
again
for
the
last
five
years
she
s
been
wretched
but
who
can
reproach
her
who
can
boast
of
her
favor
only
that
bedridden
old
merchant
but
he
is
more
like
her
father
her
friend
her
protector
he
found
her
then
in
despair
in
agony
deserted
by
the
man
she
loved
she
was
ready
to
drown
herself
then
but
the
old
merchant
saved
her
saved
her
you
defend
me
very
kindly
dear
young
lady
you
are
in
a
great
hurry
about
everything
grushenka
drawled
again
defend
you
is
it
for
me
to
defend
you
should
i
dare
to
defend
you
grushenka
angel
give
me
your
hand
look
at
that
charming
soft
little
hand
alexey
fyodorovitch
look
at
it
it
has
brought
me
happiness
and
has
lifted
me
up
and
i
m
going
to
kiss
it
outside
and
inside
here
here
here
and
three
times
she
kissed
the
certainly
charming
though
rather
fat
hand
of
grushenka
in
a
sort
of
rapture
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
charming
musical
nervous
little
laugh
watched
the
sweet
young
lady
and
obviously
liked
having
her
hand
kissed
perhaps
there
s
rather
too
much
rapture
thought
alyosha
he
blushed
he
felt
a
peculiar
uneasiness
at
heart
the
whole
time
you
won
t
make
me
blush
dear
young
lady
kissing
my
hand
like
this
before
alexey
fyodorovitch
do
you
think
i
meant
to
make
you
blush
said
katerina
ivanovna
somewhat
surprised
ah
my
dear
how
little
you
understand
me
yes
and
you
too
perhaps
quite
misunderstand
me
dear
young
lady
maybe
i
m
not
so
good
as
i
seem
to
you
i
ve
a
bad
heart
i
will
have
my
own
way
i
fascinated
poor
dmitri
fyodorovitch
that
day
simply
for
fun
but
now
you
ll
save
him
you
ve
given
me
your
word
you
ll
explain
it
all
to
him
you
ll
break
to
him
that
you
have
long
loved
another
man
who
is
now
offering
you
his
hand
oh
no
i
didn
t
give
you
my
word
to
do
that
it
was
you
kept
talking
about
that
i
didn
t
give
you
my
word
then
i
didn
t
quite
understand
you
said
katerina
ivanovna
slowly
turning
a
little
pale
you
promised
oh
no
angel
lady
i
ve
promised
nothing
grushenka
interrupted
softly
and
evenly
still
with
the
same
gay
and
simple
expression
you
see
at
once
dear
young
lady
what
a
willful
wretch
i
am
compared
with
you
if
i
want
to
do
a
thing
i
do
it
i
may
have
made
you
some
promise
just
now
but
now
again
i
m
thinking
i
may
take
to
mitya
again
i
liked
him
very
much
once
liked
him
for
almost
a
whole
hour
now
maybe
i
shall
go
and
tell
him
to
stay
with
me
from
this
day
forward
you
see
i
m
so
changeable
just
now
you
said
something
quite
different
katerina
ivanovna
whispered
faintly
ah
just
now
but
you
know
i
m
such
a
soft
hearted
silly
creature
only
think
what
he
s
gone
through
on
my
account
what
if
when
i
go
home
i
feel
sorry
for
him
what
then
i
never
expected
ah
young
lady
how
good
and
generous
you
are
compared
with
me
now
perhaps
you
won
t
care
for
a
silly
creature
like
me
now
you
know
my
character
give
me
your
sweet
little
hand
angelic
lady
she
said
tenderly
and
with
a
sort
of
reverence
took
katerina
ivanovna
s
hand
here
dear
young
lady
i
ll
take
your
hand
and
kiss
it
as
you
did
mine
you
kissed
mine
three
times
but
i
ought
to
kiss
yours
three
hundred
times
to
be
even
with
you
well
but
let
that
pass
and
then
it
shall
be
as
god
wills
perhaps
i
shall
be
your
slave
entirely
and
want
to
do
your
bidding
like
a
slave
let
it
be
as
god
wills
without
any
agreements
and
promises
what
a
sweet
hand
what
a
sweet
hand
you
have
you
sweet
young
lady
you
incredible
beauty
she
slowly
raised
the
hands
to
her
lips
with
the
strange
object
indeed
of
being
even
with
her
in
kisses
katerina
ivanovna
did
not
take
her
hand
away
she
listened
with
timid
hope
to
the
last
words
though
grushenka
s
promise
to
do
her
bidding
like
a
slave
was
very
strangely
expressed
she
looked
intently
into
her
eyes
she
still
saw
in
those
eyes
the
same
simple
hearted
confiding
expression
the
same
bright
gayety
she
s
perhaps
too
na
ve
thought
katerina
ivanovna
with
a
gleam
of
hope
grushenka
meanwhile
seemed
enthusiastic
over
the
sweet
hand
she
raised
it
deliberately
to
her
lips
but
she
held
it
for
two
or
three
minutes
near
her
lips
as
though
reconsidering
something
do
you
know
angel
lady
she
suddenly
drawled
in
an
even
more
soft
and
sugary
voice
do
you
know
after
all
i
think
i
won
t
kiss
your
hand
and
she
laughed
a
little
merry
laugh
as
you
please
what
s
the
matter
with
you
said
katerina
ivanovna
starting
suddenly
so
that
you
may
be
left
to
remember
that
you
kissed
my
hand
but
i
didn
t
kiss
yours
there
was
a
sudden
gleam
in
her
eyes
she
looked
with
awful
intentness
at
katerina
ivanovna
insolent
creature
cried
katerina
ivanovna
as
though
suddenly
grasping
something
she
flushed
all
over
and
leapt
up
from
her
seat
grushenka
too
got
up
but
without
haste
so
i
shall
tell
mitya
how
you
kissed
my
hand
but
i
didn
t
kiss
yours
at
all
and
how
he
will
laugh
vile
slut
go
away
ah
for
shame
young
lady
ah
for
shame
that
s
unbecoming
for
you
dear
young
lady
a
word
like
that
go
away
you
re
a
creature
for
sale
screamed
katerina
ivanovna
every
feature
was
working
in
her
utterly
distorted
face
for
sale
indeed
you
used
to
visit
gentlemen
in
the
dusk
for
money
once
you
brought
your
beauty
for
sale
you
see
i
know
katerina
ivanovna
shrieked
and
would
have
rushed
at
her
but
alyosha
held
her
with
all
his
strength
not
a
step
not
a
word
don
t
speak
don
t
answer
her
she
ll
go
away
she
ll
go
at
once
at
that
instant
katerina
ivanovna
s
two
aunts
ran
in
at
her
cry
and
with
them
a
maid
servant
all
hurried
to
her
i
will
go
away
said
grushenka
taking
up
her
mantle
from
the
sofa
alyosha
darling
see
me
home
go
away
go
away
make
haste
cried
alyosha
clasping
his
hands
imploringly
dear
little
alyosha
see
me
home
i
ve
got
a
pretty
little
story
to
tell
you
on
the
way
i
got
up
this
scene
for
your
benefit
alyosha
see
me
home
dear
you
ll
be
glad
of
it
afterwards
alyosha
turned
away
wringing
his
hands
grushenka
ran
out
of
the
house
laughing
musically
katerina
ivanovna
went
into
a
fit
of
hysterics
she
sobbed
and
was
shaken
with
convulsions
every
one
fussed
round
her
i
warned
you
said
the
elder
of
her
aunts
i
tried
to
prevent
your
doing
this
you
re
too
impulsive
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
you
don
t
know
these
creatures
and
they
say
she
s
worse
than
any
of
them
you
are
too
self
willed
she
s
a
tigress
yelled
katerina
ivanovna
why
did
you
hold
me
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
d
have
beaten
her
beaten
her
she
could
not
control
herself
before
alyosha
perhaps
she
did
not
care
to
indeed
she
ought
to
be
flogged
in
public
on
a
scaffold
alyosha
withdrew
towards
the
door
but
my
god
cried
katerina
ivanovna
clasping
her
hands
he
he
he
could
be
so
dishonorable
so
inhuman
why
he
told
that
creature
what
happened
on
that
fatal
accursed
day
you
brought
your
beauty
for
sale
dear
young
lady
she
knows
it
your
brother
s
a
scoundrel
alexey
fyodorovitch
alyosha
wanted
to
say
something
but
he
couldn
t
find
a
word
his
heart
ached
go
away
alexey
fyodorovitch
it
s
shameful
it
s
awful
for
me
to
morrow
i
beg
you
on
my
knees
come
to
morrow
don
t
condemn
me
forgive
me
i
don
t
know
what
i
shall
do
with
myself
now
alyosha
walked
out
into
the
street
reeling
he
could
have
wept
as
she
did
suddenly
he
was
overtaken
by
the
maid
the
young
lady
forgot
to
give
you
this
letter
from
madame
hohlakov
it
s
been
left
with
us
since
dinner
time
alyosha
took
the
little
pink
envelope
mechanically
and
put
it
almost
unconsciously
into
his
pocket
chapter
xi
another
reputation
ruined
it
was
not
much
more
than
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
town
to
the
monastery
alyosha
walked
quickly
along
the
road
at
that
hour
deserted
it
was
almost
night
and
too
dark
to
see
anything
clearly
at
thirty
paces
ahead
there
were
cross
roads
half
way
a
figure
came
into
sight
under
a
solitary
willow
at
the
cross
roads
as
soon
as
alyosha
reached
the
cross
roads
the
figure
moved
out
and
rushed
at
him
shouting
savagely
your
money
or
your
life
so
it
s
you
mitya
cried
alyosha
in
surprise
violently
startled
however
ha
ha
ha
you
didn
t
expect
me
i
wondered
where
to
wait
for
you
by
her
house
there
are
three
ways
from
it
and
i
might
have
missed
you
at
last
i
thought
of
waiting
here
for
you
had
to
pass
here
there
s
no
other
way
to
the
monastery
come
tell
me
the
truth
crush
me
like
a
beetle
but
what
s
the
matter
nothing
brother
it
s
the
fright
you
gave
me
oh
dmitri
father
s
blood
just
now
alyosha
began
to
cry
he
had
been
on
the
verge
of
tears
for
a
long
time
and
now
something
seemed
to
snap
in
his
soul
you
almost
killed
him
cursed
him
and
now
here
you
re
making
jokes
your
money
or
your
life
well
what
of
that
it
s
not
seemly
is
that
it
not
suitable
in
my
position
no
i
only
stay
look
at
the
night
you
see
what
a
dark
night
what
clouds
what
a
wind
has
risen
i
hid
here
under
the
willow
waiting
for
you
and
as
god
s
above
i
suddenly
thought
why
go
on
in
misery
any
longer
what
is
there
to
wait
for
here
i
have
a
willow
a
handkerchief
a
shirt
i
can
twist
them
into
a
rope
in
a
minute
and
braces
besides
and
why
go
on
burdening
the
earth
dishonoring
it
with
my
vile
presence
and
then
i
heard
you
coming
heavens
it
was
as
though
something
flew
down
to
me
suddenly
so
there
is
a
man
then
whom
i
love
here
he
is
that
man
my
dear
little
brother
whom
i
love
more
than
any
one
in
the
world
the
only
one
i
love
in
the
world
and
i
loved
you
so
much
so
much
at
that
moment
that
i
thought
i
ll
fall
on
his
neck
at
once
then
a
stupid
idea
struck
me
to
have
a
joke
with
you
and
scare
you
i
shouted
like
a
fool
your
money
forgive
my
foolery
it
was
only
nonsense
and
there
s
nothing
unseemly
in
my
soul
damn
it
all
tell
me
what
s
happened
what
did
she
say
strike
me
crush
me
don
t
spare
me
was
she
furious
no
not
that
there
was
nothing
like
that
mitya
there
i
found
them
both
there
both
whom
grushenka
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
dmitri
was
struck
dumb
impossible
he
cried
you
re
raving
grushenka
with
her
alyosha
described
all
that
had
happened
from
the
moment
he
went
in
to
katerina
ivanovna
s
he
was
ten
minutes
telling
his
story
he
can
t
be
said
to
have
told
it
fluently
and
consecutively
but
he
seemed
to
make
it
clear
not
omitting
any
word
or
action
of
significance
and
vividly
describing
often
in
one
word
his
own
sensations
dmitri
listened
in
silence
gazing
at
him
with
a
terrible
fixed
stare
but
it
was
clear
to
alyosha
that
he
understood
it
all
and
had
grasped
every
point
but
as
the
story
went
on
his
face
became
not
merely
gloomy
but
menacing
he
scowled
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
his
fixed
stare
became
still
more
rigid
more
concentrated
more
terrible
when
suddenly
with
incredible
rapidity
his
wrathful
savage
face
changed
his
tightly
compressed
lips
parted
and
dmitri
fyodorovitch
broke
into
uncontrolled
spontaneous
laughter
he
literally
shook
with
laughter
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
speak
so
she
wouldn
t
kiss
her
hand
so
she
didn
t
kiss
it
so
she
ran
away
he
kept
exclaiming
with
hysterical
delight
insolent
delight
it
might
have
been
called
if
it
had
not
been
so
spontaneous
so
the
other
one
called
her
tigress
and
a
tigress
she
is
so
she
ought
to
be
flogged
on
a
scaffold
yes
yes
so
she
ought
that
s
just
what
i
think
she
ought
to
have
been
long
ago
it
s
like
this
brother
let
her
be
punished
but
i
must
get
better
first
i
understand
the
queen
of
impudence
that
s
her
all
over
you
saw
her
all
over
in
that
hand
kissing
the
she
devil
she
s
magnificent
in
her
own
line
so
she
ran
home
i
ll
go
ah
i
ll
run
to
her
alyosha
don
t
blame
me
i
agree
that
hanging
is
too
good
for
her
but
katerina
ivanovna
exclaimed
alyosha
sorrowfully
i
see
her
too
i
see
right
through
her
as
i
ve
never
done
before
it
s
a
regular
discovery
of
the
four
continents
of
the
world
that
is
of
the
five
what
a
thing
to
do
that
s
just
like
katya
who
was
not
afraid
to
face
a
coarse
unmannerly
officer
and
risk
a
deadly
insult
on
a
generous
impulse
to
save
her
father
but
the
pride
the
recklessness
the
defiance
of
fate
the
unbounded
defiance
you
say
that
aunt
tried
to
stop
her
that
aunt
you
know
is
overbearing
herself
she
s
the
sister
of
the
general
s
widow
in
moscow
and
even
more
stuck
up
than
she
but
her
husband
was
caught
stealing
government
money
he
lost
everything
his
estate
and
all
and
the
proud
wife
had
to
lower
her
colors
and
hasn
t
raised
them
since
so
she
tried
to
prevent
katya
but
she
wouldn
t
listen
to
her
she
thinks
she
can
overcome
everything
that
everything
will
give
way
to
her
she
thought
she
could
bewitch
grushenka
if
she
liked
and
she
believed
it
herself
she
plays
a
part
to
herself
and
whose
fault
is
it
do
you
think
she
kissed
grushenka
s
hand
first
on
purpose
with
a
motive
no
she
really
was
fascinated
by
grushenka
that
s
to
say
not
by
grushenka
but
by
her
own
dream
her
own
delusion
because
it
was
her
dream
her
delusion
alyosha
darling
how
did
you
escape
from
them
those
women
did
you
pick
up
your
cassock
and
run
ha
ha
ha
brother
you
don
t
seem
to
have
noticed
how
you
ve
insulted
katerina
ivanovna
by
telling
grushenka
about
that
day
and
she
flung
it
in
her
face
just
now
that
she
had
gone
to
gentlemen
in
secret
to
sell
her
beauty
brother
what
could
be
worse
than
that
insult
what
worried
alyosha
more
than
anything
was
that
incredible
as
it
seemed
his
brother
appeared
pleased
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
humiliation
bah
dmitri
frowned
fiercely
and
struck
his
forehead
with
his
hand
he
only
now
realized
it
though
alyosha
had
just
told
him
of
the
insult
and
katerina
ivanovna
s
cry
your
brother
is
a
scoundrel
yes
perhaps
i
really
did
tell
grushenka
about
that
fatal
day
as
katya
calls
it
yes
i
did
tell
her
i
remember
it
was
that
time
at
mokroe
i
was
drunk
the
gypsies
were
singing
but
i
was
sobbing
i
was
sobbing
then
kneeling
and
praying
to
katya
s
image
and
grushenka
understood
it
she
understood
it
all
then
i
remember
she
cried
herself
damn
it
all
but
it
s
bound
to
be
so
now
then
she
cried
but
now
the
dagger
in
the
heart
that
s
how
women
are
he
looked
down
and
sank
into
thought
yes
i
am
a
scoundrel
a
thorough
scoundrel
he
said
suddenly
in
a
gloomy
voice
it
doesn
t
matter
whether
i
cried
or
not
i
m
a
scoundrel
tell
her
i
accept
the
name
if
that
s
any
comfort
come
that
s
enough
good
by
it
s
no
use
talking
it
s
not
amusing
you
go
your
way
and
i
mine
and
i
don
t
want
to
see
you
again
except
as
a
last
resource
good
by
alexey
he
warmly
pressed
alyosha
s
hand
and
still
looking
down
without
raising
his
head
as
though
tearing
himself
away
turned
rapidly
towards
the
town
alyosha
looked
after
him
unable
to
believe
he
would
go
away
so
abruptly
stay
alexey
one
more
confession
to
you
alone
cried
dmitri
suddenly
turning
back
look
at
me
look
at
me
well
you
see
here
here
there
s
terrible
disgrace
in
store
for
me
as
he
said
here
dmitri
struck
his
chest
with
his
fist
with
a
strange
air
as
though
the
dishonor
lay
precisely
on
his
chest
in
some
spot
in
a
pocket
perhaps
or
hanging
round
his
neck
you
know
me
now
a
scoundrel
an
avowed
scoundrel
but
let
me
tell
you
that
i
ve
never
done
anything
before
and
never
shall
again
anything
that
can
compare
in
baseness
with
the
dishonor
which
i
bear
now
at
this
very
minute
on
my
breast
here
here
which
will
come
to
pass
though
i
m
perfectly
free
to
stop
it
i
can
stop
it
or
carry
it
through
note
that
well
let
me
tell
you
i
shall
carry
it
through
i
shan
t
stop
it
i
told
you
everything
just
now
but
i
didn
t
tell
you
this
because
even
i
had
not
brass
enough
for
it
i
can
still
pull
up
if
i
do
i
can
give
back
the
full
half
of
my
lost
honor
to
morrow
but
i
shan
t
pull
up
i
shall
carry
out
my
base
plan
and
you
can
bear
witness
that
i
told
you
so
beforehand
darkness
and
destruction
no
need
to
explain
you
ll
find
out
in
due
time
the
filthy
back
alley
and
the
she
devil
good
by
don
t
pray
for
me
i
m
not
worth
it
and
there
s
no
need
no
need
at
all
i
don
t
need
it
away
and
he
suddenly
retreated
this
time
finally
alyosha
went
towards
the
monastery
what
i
shall
never
see
him
again
what
is
he
saying
he
wondered
wildly
why
i
shall
certainly
see
him
to
morrow
i
shall
look
him
up
i
shall
make
a
point
of
it
what
does
he
mean
he
went
round
the
monastery
and
crossed
the
pine
wood
to
the
hermitage
the
door
was
opened
to
him
though
no
one
was
admitted
at
that
hour
there
was
a
tremor
in
his
heart
as
he
went
into
father
zossima
s
cell
why
why
had
he
gone
forth
why
had
he
sent
him
into
the
world
here
was
peace
here
was
holiness
but
there
was
confusion
there
was
darkness
in
which
one
lost
one
s
way
and
went
astray
at
once
in
the
cell
he
found
the
novice
porfiry
and
father
pa
ssy
who
came
every
hour
to
inquire
after
father
zossima
alyosha
learnt
with
alarm
that
he
was
getting
worse
and
worse
even
his
usual
discourse
with
the
brothers
could
not
take
place
that
day
as
a
rule
every
evening
after
service
the
monks
flocked
into
father
zossima
s
cell
and
all
confessed
aloud
their
sins
of
the
day
their
sinful
thoughts
and
temptations
even
their
disputes
if
there
had
been
any
some
confessed
kneeling
the
elder
absolved
reconciled
exhorted
imposed
penance
blessed
and
dismissed
them
it
was
against
this
general
confession
that
the
opponents
of
elders
protested
maintaining
that
it
was
a
profanation
of
the
sacrament
of
confession
almost
a
sacrilege
though
this
was
quite
a
different
thing
they
even
represented
to
the
diocesan
authorities
that
such
confessions
attained
no
good
object
but
actually
to
a
large
extent
led
to
sin
and
temptation
many
of
the
brothers
disliked
going
to
the
elder
and
went
against
their
own
will
because
every
one
went
and
for
fear
they
should
be
accused
of
pride
and
rebellious
ideas
people
said
that
some
of
the
monks
agreed
beforehand
saying
i
ll
confess
i
lost
my
temper
with
you
this
morning
and
you
confirm
it
simply
in
order
to
have
something
to
say
alyosha
knew
that
this
actually
happened
sometimes
he
knew
too
that
there
were
among
the
monks
some
who
deeply
resented
the
fact
that
letters
from
relations
were
habitually
taken
to
the
elder
to
be
opened
and
read
by
him
before
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
it
was
assumed
of
course
that
all
this
was
done
freely
and
in
good
faith
by
way
of
voluntary
submission
and
salutary
guidance
but
in
fact
there
was
sometimes
no
little
insincerity
and
much
that
was
false
and
strained
in
this
practice
yet
the
older
and
more
experienced
of
the
monks
adhered
to
their
opinion
arguing
that
for
those
who
have
come
within
these
walls
sincerely
seeking
salvation
such
obedience
and
sacrifice
will
certainly
be
salutary
and
of
great
benefit
those
on
the
other
hand
who
find
it
irksome
and
repine
are
no
true
monks
and
have
made
a
mistake
in
entering
the
monastery
their
proper
place
is
in
the
world
even
in
the
temple
one
cannot
be
safe
from
sin
and
the
devil
so
it
was
no
good
taking
it
too
much
into
account
he
is
weaker
a
drowsiness
has
come
over
him
father
pa
ssy
whispered
to
alyosha
as
he
blessed
him
it
s
difficult
to
rouse
him
and
he
must
not
be
roused
he
waked
up
for
five
minutes
sent
his
blessing
to
the
brothers
and
begged
their
prayers
for
him
at
night
he
intends
to
take
the
sacrament
again
in
the
morning
he
remembered
you
alexey
he
asked
whether
you
had
gone
away
and
was
told
that
you
were
in
the
town
i
blessed
him
for
that
work
he
said
his
place
is
there
not
here
for
awhile
those
were
his
words
about
you
he
remembered
you
lovingly
with
anxiety
do
you
understand
how
he
honored
you
but
how
is
it
that
he
has
decided
that
you
shall
spend
some
time
in
the
world
he
must
have
foreseen
something
in
your
destiny
understand
alexey
that
if
you
return
to
the
world
it
must
be
to
do
the
duty
laid
upon
you
by
your
elder
and
not
for
frivolous
vanity
and
worldly
pleasures
father
pa
ssy
went
out
alyosha
had
no
doubt
that
father
zossima
was
dying
though
he
might
live
another
day
or
two
alyosha
firmly
and
ardently
resolved
that
in
spite
of
his
promises
to
his
father
the
hohlakovs
and
katerina
ivanovna
he
would
not
leave
the
monastery
next
day
but
would
remain
with
his
elder
to
the
end
his
heart
glowed
with
love
and
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
having
been
able
for
one
instant
to
forget
him
whom
he
had
left
in
the
monastery
on
his
deathbed
and
whom
he
honored
above
every
one
in
the
world
he
went
into
father
zossima
s
bedroom
knelt
down
and
bowed
to
the
ground
before
the
elder
who
slept
quietly
without
stirring
with
regular
hardly
audible
breathing
and
a
peaceful
face
alyosha
returned
to
the
other
room
where
father
zossima
had
received
his
guests
in
the
morning
taking
off
his
boots
he
lay
down
on
the
hard
narrow
leathern
sofa
which
he
had
long
used
as
a
bed
bringing
nothing
but
a
pillow
the
mattress
about
which
his
father
had
shouted
to
him
that
morning
he
had
long
forgotten
to
lie
on
he
took
off
his
cassock
which
he
used
as
a
covering
but
before
going
to
bed
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
prayed
a
long
time
in
his
fervent
prayer
he
did
not
beseech
god
to
lighten
his
darkness
but
only
thirsted
for
the
joyous
emotion
which
always
visited
his
soul
after
the
praise
and
adoration
of
which
his
evening
prayer
usually
consisted
that
joy
always
brought
him
light
untroubled
sleep
as
he
was
praying
he
suddenly
felt
in
his
pocket
the
little
pink
note
the
servant
had
handed
him
as
he
left
katerina
ivanovna
s
he
was
disturbed
but
finished
his
prayer
then
after
some
hesitation
he
opened
the
envelope
in
it
was
a
letter
to
him
signed
by
lise
the
young
daughter
of
madame
hohlakov
who
had
laughed
at
him
before
the
elder
in
the
morning
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
wrote
i
am
writing
to
you
without
any
one
s
knowledge
even
mamma
s
and
i
know
how
wrong
it
is
but
i
cannot
live
without
telling
you
the
feeling
that
has
sprung
up
in
my
heart
and
this
no
one
but
us
two
must
know
for
a
time
but
how
am
i
to
say
what
i
want
so
much
to
tell
you
paper
they
say
does
not
blush
but
i
assure
you
it
s
not
true
and
that
it
s
blushing
just
as
i
am
now
all
over
dear
alyosha
i
love
you
i
ve
loved
you
from
my
childhood
since
our
moscow
days
when
you
were
very
different
from
what
you
are
now
and
i
shall
love
you
all
my
life
my
heart
has
chosen
you
to
unite
our
lives
and
pass
them
together
till
our
old
age
of
course
on
condition
that
you
will
leave
the
monastery
as
for
our
age
we
will
wait
for
the
time
fixed
by
the
law
by
that
time
i
shall
certainly
be
quite
strong
i
shall
be
walking
and
dancing
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
you
see
how
i
ve
thought
of
everything
there
s
only
one
thing
i
can
t
imagine
what
you
ll
think
of
me
when
you
read
this
i
m
always
laughing
and
being
naughty
i
made
you
angry
this
morning
but
i
assure
you
before
i
took
up
my
pen
i
prayed
before
the
image
of
the
mother
of
god
and
now
i
m
praying
and
almost
crying
my
secret
is
in
your
hands
when
you
come
to
morrow
i
don
t
know
how
i
shall
look
at
you
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
what
if
i
can
t
restrain
myself
like
a
silly
and
laugh
when
i
look
at
you
as
i
did
to
day
you
ll
think
i
m
a
nasty
girl
making
fun
of
you
and
you
won
t
believe
my
letter
and
so
i
beg
you
dear
one
if
you
ve
any
pity
for
me
when
you
come
to
morrow
don
t
look
me
straight
in
the
face
for
if
i
meet
your
eyes
it
will
be
sure
to
make
me
laugh
especially
as
you
ll
be
in
that
long
gown
i
feel
cold
all
over
when
i
think
of
it
so
when
you
come
don
t
look
at
me
at
all
for
a
time
look
at
mamma
or
at
the
window
here
i
ve
written
you
a
love
letter
oh
dear
what
have
i
done
alyosha
don
t
despise
me
and
if
i
ve
done

alyosha
read
the
note
in
amazement
read
it
through
twice
thought
a
little
and
suddenly
laughed
a
soft
sweet
laugh
he
started
that
laugh
seemed
to
him
sinful
but
a
minute
later
he
laughed
again
just
as
softly
and
happily
he
slowly
replaced
the
note
in
the
envelope
crossed
himself
and
lay
down
the
agitation
in
his
heart
passed
at
once
god
have
mercy
upon
all
of
them
have
all
these
unhappy
and
turbulent
souls
in
thy
keeping
and
set
them
in
the
right
path
all
ways

thine
save

according
to
thy

send
joy

falling

i
father
ferapont
alyosha
was
roused
early
before
daybreak
father
zossima
woke
up
feeling
very
weak
though
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
bed
and
sit
up
in
a
chair
his
mind
was
quite
clear
his
face
looked
very
tired
yet
bright
and
almost
joyful
it
wore
an
expression
of
gayety
kindness
and
cordiality
maybe
i
shall
not
live
through
the
coming
day
he
said
to
alyosha
then
he
desired
to
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
at
once
he
always
confessed
to
father
pa
ssy
after
taking
the
communion
the
service
of
extreme
unction
followed
the
monks
assembled
and
the
cell
was
gradually
filled
up
by
the
inmates
of
the
hermitage
meantime
it
was
daylight
people
began
coming
from
the
monastery
after
the
service
was
over
the
elder
desired
to
kiss
and
take
leave
of
every
one
as
the
cell
was
so
small
the
earlier
visitors
withdrew
to
make
room
for
others
alyosha
stood
beside
the
elder
who
was
seated
again
in
his
arm
chair
he
talked
as
much
as
he
could
though
his
voice
was
weak
it
was
fairly
steady
i
ve
been
teaching
you
so
many
years
and
therefore
i
ve
been
talking
aloud
so
many
years
that
i
ve
got
into
the
habit
of
talking
and
so
much
so
that
it
s
almost
more
difficult
for
me
to
hold
my
tongue
than
to
talk
even
now
in
spite
of
my
weakness
dear
fathers
and
brothers
he
jested
looking
with
emotion
at
the
group
round
him
alyosha
remembered
afterwards
something
of
what
he
said
to
them
but
though
he
spoke
out
distinctly
and
his
voice
was
fairly
steady
his
speech
was
somewhat
disconnected
he
spoke
of
many
things
he
seemed
anxious
before
the
moment
of
death
to
say
everything
he
had
not
said
in
his
life
and
not
simply
for
the
sake
of
instructing
them
but
as
though
thirsting
to
share
with
all
men
and
all
creation
his
joy
and
ecstasy
and
once
more
in
his
life
to
open
his
whole
heart
love
one
another
fathers
said
father
zossima
as
far
as
alyosha
could
remember
afterwards
love
god
s
people
because
we
have
come
here
and
shut
ourselves
within
these
walls
we
are
no
holier
than
those
that
are
outside
but
on
the
contrary
from
the
very
fact
of
coming
here
each
of
us
has
confessed
to
himself
that
he
is
worse
than
others
than
all
men
on
earth
and
the
longer
the
monk
lives
in
his
seclusion
the
more
keenly
he
must
recognize
that
else
he
would
have
had
no
reason
to
come
here
when
he
realizes
that
he
is
not
only
worse
than
others
but
that
he
is
responsible
to
all
men
for
all
and
everything
for
all
human
sins
national
and
individual
only
then
the
aim
of
our
seclusion
is
attained
for
know
dear
ones
that
every
one
of
us
is
undoubtedly
responsible
for
all
men
and
everything
on
earth
not
merely
through
the
general
sinfulness
of
creation
but
each
one
personally
for
all
mankind
and
every
individual
man
this
knowledge
is
the
crown
of
life
for
the
monk
and
for
every
man
for
monks
are
not
a
special
sort
of
men
but
only
what
all
men
ought
to
be
only
through
that
knowledge
our
heart
grows
soft
with
infinite
universal
inexhaustible
love
then
every
one
of
you
will
have
the
power
to
win
over
the
whole
world
by
love
and
to
wash
away
the
sins
of
the
world
with
your
tears
each
of
you
keep
watch
over
your
heart
and
confess
your
sins
to
yourself
unceasingly
be
not
afraid
of
your
sins
even
when
perceiving
them
if
only
there
be
penitence
but
make
no
conditions
with
god
again
i
say
be
not
proud
be
proud
neither
to
the
little
nor
to
the
great
hate
not
those
who
reject
you
who
insult
you
who
abuse
and
slander
you
hate
not
the
atheists
the
teachers
of
evil
the
materialists
and
i
mean
not
only
the
good
ones
for
there
are
many
good
ones
among
them
especially
in
our
day
hate
not
even
the
wicked
ones
remember
them
in
your
prayers
thus
save
o
lord
all
those
who
have
none
to
pray
for
them
save
too
all
those
who
will
not
pray
and
add
it
is
not
in
pride
that
i
make
this
prayer
o
lord
for
i
am
lower
than
all
men
love
god
s
people
let
not
strangers
draw
away
the
flock
for
if
you
slumber
in
your
slothfulness
and
disdainful
pride
or
worse
still
in
covetousness
they
will
come
from
all
sides
and
draw
away
your
flock
expound
the
gospel
to
the
people
unceasingly
be
not
extortionate
do
not
love
gold
and
silver
do
not
hoard
them
have
faith
cling
to
the
banner
and
raise
it
on
high
but
the
elder
spoke
more
disconnectedly
than
alyosha
reported
his
words
afterwards
sometimes
he
broke
off
altogether
as
though
to
take
breath
and
recover
his
strength
but
he
was
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
they
heard
him
with
emotion
though
many
wondered
at
his
words
and
found
them
obscure
afterwards
all
remembered
those
words
when
alyosha
happened
for
a
moment
to
leave
the
cell
he
was
struck
by
the
general
excitement
and
suspense
in
the
monks
who
were
crowding
about
it
this
anticipation
showed
itself
in
some
by
anxiety
in
others
by
devout
solemnity
all
were
expecting
that
some
marvel
would
happen
immediately
after
the
elder
s
death
their
suspense
was
from
one
point
of
view
almost
frivolous
but
even
the
most
austere
of
the
monks
were
affected
by
it
father
pa
ssy
s
face
looked
the
gravest
of
all
alyosha
was
mysteriously
summoned
by
a
monk
to
see
rakitin
who
had
arrived
from
town
with
a
singular
letter
for
him
from
madame
hohlakov
in
it
she
informed
alyosha
of
a
strange
and
very
opportune
incident
it
appeared
that
among
the
women
who
had
come
on
the
previous
day
to
receive
father
zossima
s
blessing
there
had
been
an
old
woman
from
the
town
a
sergeant
s
widow
called
prohorovna
she
had
inquired
whether
she
might
pray
for
the
rest
of
the
soul
of
her
son
vassenka
who
had
gone
to
irkutsk
and
had
sent
her
no
news
for
over
a
year
to
which
father
zossima
had
answered
sternly
forbidding
her
to
do
so
and
saying
that
to
pray
for
the
living
as
though
they
were
dead
was
a
kind
of
sorcery
he
afterwards
forgave
her
on
account
of
her
ignorance
and
added
as
though
reading
the
book
of
the
future
this
was
madame
hohlakov
s
expression
words
of
comfort
that
her
son
vassya
was
certainly
alive
and
he
would
either
come
himself
very
shortly
or
send
a
letter
and
that
she
was
to
go
home
and
expect
him
and
would
you
believe
it
exclaimed
madame
hohlakov
enthusiastically
the
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
literally
indeed
and
more
than
that
scarcely
had
the
old
woman
reached
home
when
they
gave
her
a
letter
from
siberia
which
had
been
awaiting
her
but
that
was
not
all
in
the
letter
written
on
the
road
from
ekaterinenburg
vassya
informed
his
mother
that
he
was
returning
to
russia
with
an
official
and
that
three
weeks
after
her
receiving
the
letter
he
hoped
to
embrace
his
mother
madame
hohlakov
warmly
entreated
alyosha
to
report
this
new
miracle
of
prediction
to
the
superior
and
all
the
brotherhood
all
all
ought
to
know
of
it
she
concluded
the
letter
had
been
written
in
haste
the
excitement
of
the
writer
was
apparent
in
every
line
of
it
but
alyosha
had
no
need
to
tell
the
monks
for
all
knew
of
it
already
rakitin
had
commissioned
the
monk
who
brought
his
message
to
inform
most
respectfully
his
reverence
father
pa
ssy
that
he
rakitin
has
a
matter
to
speak
of
with
him
of
such
gravity
that
he
dare
not
defer
it
for
a
moment
and
humbly
begs
forgiveness
for
his
presumption
as
the
monk
had
given
the
message
to
father
pa
ssy
before
that
to
alyosha
the
latter
found
after
reading
the
letter
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
hand
it
to
father
pa
ssy
in
confirmation
of
the
story
and
even
that
austere
and
cautious
man
though
he
frowned
as
he
read
the
news
of
the
miracle
could
not
completely
restrain
some
inner
emotion
his
eyes
gleamed
and
a
grave
and
solemn
smile
came
into
his
lips
we
shall
see
greater
things
broke
from
him
we
shall
see
greater
things
greater
things
yet
the
monks
around
repeated
but
father
pa
ssy
frowning
again
begged
all
of
them
at
least
for
a
time
not
to
speak
of
the
matter
till
it
be
more
fully
confirmed
seeing
there
is
so
much
credulity
among
those
of
this
world
and
indeed
this
might
well
have
chanced
naturally
he
added
prudently
as
it
were
to
satisfy
his
conscience
though
scarcely
believing
his
own
disavowal
a
fact
his
listeners
very
clearly
perceived
within
the
hour
the
miracle
was
of
course
known
to
the
whole
monastery
and
many
visitors
who
had
come
for
the
mass
no
one
seemed
more
impressed
by
it
than
the
monk
who
had
come
the
day
before
from
st
sylvester
from
the
little
monastery
of
obdorsk
in
the
far
north
it
was
he
who
had
been
standing
near
madame
hohlakov
the
previous
day
and
had
asked
father
zossima
earnestly
referring
to
the
healing
of
the
lady
s
daughter
how
can
you
presume
to
do
such
things
he
was
now
somewhat
puzzled
and
did
not
know
whom
to
believe
the
evening
before
he
had
visited
father
ferapont
in
his
cell
apart
behind
the
apiary
and
had
been
greatly
impressed
and
overawed
by
the
visit
this
father
ferapont
was
that
aged
monk
so
devout
in
fasting
and
observing
silence
who
has
been
mentioned
already
as
antagonistic
to
father
zossima
and
the
whole
institution
of
elders
which
he
regarded
as
a
pernicious
and
frivolous
innovation
he
was
a
very
formidable
opponent
although
from
his
practice
of
silence
he
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
any
one
what
made
him
formidable
was
that
a
number
of
monks
fully
shared
his
feeling
and
many
of
the
visitors
looked
upon
him
as
a
great
saint
and
ascetic
although
they
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
crazy
but
it
was
just
his
craziness
attracted
them
father
ferapont
never
went
to
see
the
elder
though
he
lived
in
the
hermitage
they
did
not
worry
him
to
keep
its
regulations
and
this
too
because
he
behaved
as
though
he
were
crazy
he
was
seventy
five
or
more
and
he
lived
in
a
corner
beyond
the
apiary
in
an
old
decaying
wooden
cell
which
had
been
built
long
ago
for
another
great
ascetic
father
iona
who
had
lived
to
be
a
hundred
and
five
and
of
whose
saintly
doings
many
curious
stories
were
still
extant
in
the
monastery
and
the
neighborhood
father
ferapont
had
succeeded
in
getting
himself
installed
in
this
same
solitary
cell
seven
years
previously
it
was
simply
a
peasant
s
hut
though
it
looked
like
a
chapel
for
it
contained
an
extraordinary
number
of
ikons
with
lamps
perpetually
burning
before
them
which
men
brought
to
the
monastery
as
offerings
to
god
father
ferapont
had
been
appointed
to
look
after
them
and
keep
the
lamps
burning
it
was
said
and
indeed
it
was
true
that
he
ate
only
two
pounds
of
bread
in
three
days
the
beekeeper
who
lived
close
by
the
apiary
used
to
bring
him
the
bread
every
three
days
and
even
to
this
man
who
waited
upon
him
father
ferapont
rarely
uttered
a
word
the
four
pounds
of
bread
together
with
the
sacrament
bread
regularly
sent
him
on
sundays
after
the
late
mass
by
the
father
superior
made
up
his
weekly
rations
the
water
in
his
jug
was
changed
every
day
he
rarely
appeared
at
mass
visitors
who
came
to
do
him
homage
saw
him
sometimes
kneeling
all
day
long
at
prayer
without
looking
round
if
he
addressed
them
he
was
brief
abrupt
strange
and
almost
always
rude
on
very
rare
occasions
however
he
would
talk
to
visitors
but
for
the
most
part
he
would
utter
some
one
strange
saying
which
was
a
complete
riddle
and
no
entreaties
would
induce
him
to
pronounce
a
word
in
explanation
he
was
not
a
priest
but
a
simple
monk
there
was
a
strange
belief
chiefly
however
among
the
most
ignorant
that
father
ferapont
had
communication
with
heavenly
spirits
and
would
only
converse
with
them
and
so
was
silent
with
men
the
monk
from
obdorsk
having
been
directed
to
the
apiary
by
the
beekeeper
who
was
also
a
very
silent
and
surly
monk
went
to
the
corner
where
father
ferapont
s
cell
stood
maybe
he
will
speak
as
you
are
a
stranger
and
maybe
you
ll
get
nothing
out
of
him
the
beekeeper
had
warned
him
the
monk
as
he
related
afterwards
approached
in
the
utmost
apprehension
it
was
rather
late
in
the
evening
father
ferapont
was
sitting
at
the
door
of
his
cell
on
a
low
bench
a
huge
old
elm
was
lightly
rustling
overhead
there
was
an
evening
freshness
in
the
air
the
monk
from
obdorsk
bowed
down
before
the
saint
and
asked
his
blessing
do
you
want
me
to
bow
down
to
you
monk
said
father
ferapont
get
up
the
monk
got
up
blessing
be
blessed
sit
beside
me
where
have
you
come
from
what
most
struck
the
poor
monk
was
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
his
strict
fasting
and
great
age
father
ferapont
still
looked
a
vigorous
old
man
he
was
tall
held
himself
erect
and
had
a
thin
but
fresh
and
healthy
face
there
was
no
doubt
he
still
had
considerable
strength
he
was
of
athletic
build
in
spite
of
his
great
age
he
was
not
even
quite
gray
and
still
had
very
thick
hair
and
a
full
beard
both
of
which
had
once
been
black
his
eyes
were
gray
large
and
luminous
but
strikingly
prominent
he
spoke
with
a
broad
accent
he
was
dressed
in
a
peasant
s
long
reddish
coat
of
coarse
convict
cloth
as
it
used
to
be
called
and
had
a
stout
rope
round
his
waist
his
throat
and
chest
were
bare
beneath
his
coat
his
shirt
of
the
coarsest
linen
showed
almost
black
with
dirt
not
having
been
changed
for
months
they
said
that
he
wore
irons
weighing
thirty
pounds
under
his
coat
his
stockingless
feet
were
thrust
in
old
slippers
almost
dropping
to
pieces
from
the
little
obdorsk
monastery
from
st
sylvester
the
monk
answered
humbly
whilst
his
keen
and
inquisitive
but
rather
frightened
little
eyes
kept
watch
on
the
hermit
i
have
been
at

on
weekdays
we
have
dried
fish
and
kasha
with
the
cabbage
soup
from
monday
till
saturday
evening
six
whole
days
in
holy
week
nothing
is
cooked
and
we
have
only
bread
and
water
and
that
sparingly
if
possible
not
taking
food
every
day
just
the
same
as
is
ordered
for
first
week
in
lent
on
good
friday
nothing
is
eaten
in
the
same
way
on
the
saturday
we
have
to
fast
till
three
o
clock
and
then
take
a
little
bread
and
water
and
drink
a
single
cup
of
wine
on
holy
thursday
we
drink
wine
and
have
something
cooked
without
oil
or
not
cooked
at
all
inasmuch
as
the
laodicean
council
lays
down
for
holy
thursday
it
is
unseemly
by
remitting
the
fast
on
the
holy
thursday
to
dishonor
the
whole
of
lent
this
is
how
we
keep
the
fast
but
what
is
that
compared
with
you
holy
father
added
the
monk
growing
more
confident
for
all
the
year
round
even
at
easter
you
take
nothing
but
bread
and
water
and
what
we
should
eat
in
two
days
lasts
you
full
seven
it
s
truly
marvelous
your
great
abstinence
and
mushrooms
asked
father
ferapont
suddenly
mushrooms
repeated
the
surprised
monk
yes
i
can
give
up
their
bread
not
needing
it
at
all
and
go
away
into
the
forest
and
live
there
on
the
mushrooms
or
the
berries
but
they
can
t
give
up
their
bread
here
wherefore
they
are
in
bondage
to
the
devil
nowadays
the
unclean
deny
that
there
is
need
of
such
fasting
haughty
and
unclean
is
their
judgment
och
true
sighed
the
monk
and
have
you
seen
devils
among
them
asked
ferapont
among
them
among
whom
asked
the
monk
timidly
i
went
to
the
father
superior
on
trinity
sunday
last
year
i
haven
t
been
since
i
saw
a
devil
sitting
on
one
man
s
chest
hiding
under
his
cassock
only
his
horns
poked
out
another
had
one
peeping
out
of
his
pocket
with
such
sharp
eyes
he
was
afraid
of
me
another
settled
in
the
unclean
belly
of
one
another
was
hanging
round
a
man
s
neck
and
so
he
was
carrying
him
about
without
seeing
him
you
can
see
spirits
the
monk
inquired
i
tell
you
i
can
see
i
can
see
through
them
when
i
was
coming
out
from
the
superior
s
i
saw
one
hiding
from
me
behind
the
door
and
a
big
one
a
yard
and
a
half
or
more
high
with
a
thick
long
gray
tail
and
the
tip
of
his
tail
was
in
the
crack
of
the
door
and
i
was
quick
and
slammed
the
door
pinching
his
tail
in
it
he
squealed
and
began
to
struggle
and
i
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
three
times
and
he
died
on
the
spot
like
a
crushed
spider
he
must
have
rotted
there
in
the
corner
and
be
stinking
but
they
don
t
see
they
don
t
smell
it
it
s
a
year
since
i
have
been
there
i
reveal
it
to
you
as
you
are
a
stranger
your
words
are
terrible
but
holy
and
blessed
father
said
the
monk
growing
bolder
and
bolder
is
it
true
as
they
noise
abroad
even
to
distant
lands
about
you
that
you
are
in
continual
communication
with
the
holy
ghost
he
does
fly
down
at
times
how
does
he
fly
down
in
what
form
as
a
bird
the
holy
ghost
in
the
form
of
a
dove
there
s
the
holy
ghost
and
there
s
the
holy
spirit
the
holy
spirit
can
appear
as
other
birds
sometimes
as
a
swallow
sometimes
a
goldfinch
and
sometimes
as
a
blue
tit
how
do
you
know
him
from
an
ordinary
tit
he
speaks
how
does
he
speak
in
what
language
human
language
and
what
does
he
tell
you
why
to
day
he
told
me
that
a
fool
would
visit
me
and
would
ask
me
unseemly
questions
you
want
to
know
too
much
monk
terrible
are
your
words
most
holy
and
blessed
father
the
monk
shook
his
head
but
there
was
a
doubtful
look
in
his
frightened
little
eyes
do
you
see
this
tree
asked
father
ferapont
after
a
pause
i
do
blessed
father
you
think
it
s
an
elm
but
for
me
it
has
another
shape
what
sort
of
shape
inquired
the
monk
after
a
pause
of
vain
expectation
it
happens
at
night
you
see
those
two
branches
in
the
night
it
is
christ
holding
out
his
arms
to
me
and
seeking
me
with
those
arms
i
see
it
clearly
and
tremble
it
s
terrible
terrible
what
is
there
terrible
if
it
s
christ
himself
why
he
ll
snatch
me
up
and
carry
me
away
alive
in
the
spirit
and
glory
of
elijah
haven
t
you
heard
he
will
take
me
in
his
arms
and
bear
me
away
though
the
monk
returned
to
the
cell
he
was
sharing
with
one
of
the
brothers
in
considerable
perplexity
of
mind
he
still
cherished
at
heart
a
greater
reverence
for
father
ferapont
than
for
father
zossima
he
was
strongly
in
favor
of
fasting
and
it
was
not
strange
that
one
who
kept
so
rigid
a
fast
as
father
ferapont
should
see
marvels
his
words
seemed
certainly
queer
but
god
only
could
tell
what
was
hidden
in
those
words
and
were
not
worse
words
and
acts
commonly
seen
in
those
who
have
sacrificed
their
intellects
for
the
glory
of
god
the
pinching
of
the
devil
s
tail
he
was
ready
and
eager
to
believe
and
not
only
in
the
figurative
sense
besides
he
had
before
visiting
the
monastery
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
institution
of
elders
which
he
only
knew
of
by
hearsay
and
believed
to
be
a
pernicious
innovation
before
he
had
been
long
at
the
monastery
he
had
detected
the
secret
murmurings
of
some
shallow
brothers
who
disliked
the
institution
he
was
besides
a
meddlesome
inquisitive
man
who
poked
his
nose
into
everything
this
was
why
the
news
of
the
fresh
miracle
performed
by
father
zossima
reduced
him
to
extreme
perplexity
alyosha
remembered
afterwards
how
their
inquisitive
guest
from
obdorsk
had
been
continually
flitting
to
and
fro
from
one
group
to
another
listening
and
asking
questions
among
the
monks
that
were
crowding
within
and
without
the
elder
s
cell
but
he
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
him
at
the
time
and
only
recollected
it
afterwards
he
had
no
thought
to
spare
for
it
indeed
for
when
father
zossima
feeling
tired
again
had
gone
back
to
bed
he
thought
of
alyosha
as
he
was
closing
his
eyes
and
sent
for
him
alyosha
ran
at
once
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
cell
but
father
pa
ssy
father
iosif
and
the
novice
porfiry
the
elder
opening
his
weary
eyes
and
looking
intently
at
alyosha
asked
him
suddenly
are
your
people
expecting
you
my
son
alyosha
hesitated
haven
t
they
need
of
you
didn
t
you
promise
some
one
yesterday
to
see
them
to
day
i
did
promise
to
my
father
my
brothers
others
too
you
see
you
must
go
don
t
grieve
be
sure
i
shall
not
die
without
your
being
by
to
hear
my
last
word
to
you
i
will
say
that
word
my
son
it
will
be
my
last
gift
to
you
to
you
dear
son
because
you
love
me
but
now
go
to
keep
your
promise
alyosha
immediately
obeyed
though
it
was
hard
to
go
but
the
promise
that
he
should
hear
his
last
word
on
earth
that
it
should
be
the
last
gift
to
him
alyosha
sent
a
thrill
of
rapture
through
his
soul
he
made
haste
that
he
might
finish
what
he
had
to
do
in
the
town
and
return
quickly
father
pa
ssy
too
uttered
some
words
of
exhortation
which
moved
and
surprised
him
greatly
he
spoke
as
they
left
the
cell
together
remember
young
man
unceasingly
father
pa
ssy
began
without
preface
that
the
science
of
this
world
which
has
become
a
great
power
has
especially
in
the
last
century
analyzed
everything
divine
handed
down
to
us
in
the
holy
books
after
this
cruel
analysis
the
learned
of
this
world
have
nothing
left
of
all
that
was
sacred
of
old
but
they
have
only
analyzed
the
parts
and
overlooked
the
whole
and
indeed
their
blindness
is
marvelous
yet
the
whole
still
stands
steadfast
before
their
eyes
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
has
it
not
lasted
nineteen
centuries
is
it
not
still
a
living
a
moving
power
in
the
individual
soul
and
in
the
masses
of
people
it
is
still
as
strong
and
living
even
in
the
souls
of
atheists
who
have
destroyed
everything
for
even
those
who
have
renounced
christianity
and
attack
it
in
their
inmost
being
still
follow
the
christian
ideal
for
hitherto
neither
their
subtlety
nor
the
ardor
of
their
hearts
has
been
able
to
create
a
higher
ideal
of
man
and
of
virtue
than
the
ideal
given
by
christ
of
old
when
it
has
been
attempted
the
result
has
been
only
grotesque
remember
this
especially
young
man
since
you
are
being
sent
into
the
world
by
your
departing
elder
maybe
remembering
this
great
day
you
will
not
forget
my
words
uttered
from
the
heart
for
your
guidance
seeing
you
are
young
and
the
temptations
of
the
world
are
great
and
beyond
your
strength
to
endure
well
now
go
my
orphan
with
these
words
father
pa
ssy
blessed
him
as
alyosha
left
the
monastery
and
thought
them
over
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
met
a
new
and
unexpected
friend
a
warmly
loving
teacher
in
this
austere
monk
who
had
hitherto
treated
him
sternly
it
was
as
though
father
zossima
had
bequeathed
him
to
him
at
his
death
and
perhaps
that
s
just
what
had
passed
between
them
alyosha
thought
suddenly
the
philosophic
reflections
he
had
just
heard
so
unexpectedly
testified
to
the
warmth
of
father
pa
ssy
s
heart
he
was
in
haste
to
arm
the
boy
s
mind
for
conflict
with
temptation
and
to
guard
the
young
soul
left
in
his
charge
with
the
strongest
defense
he
could
imagine
chapter
ii
at
his
father
s
first
of
all
alyosha
went
to
his
father
on
the
way
he
remembered
that
his
father
had
insisted
the
day
before
that
he
should
come
without
his
brother
ivan
seeing
him
why
so
alyosha
wondered
suddenly
even
if
my
father
has
something
to
say
to
me
alone
why
should
i
go
in
unseen
most
likely
in
his
excitement
yesterday
he
meant
to
say
something
different
he
decided
yet
he
was
very
glad
when
marfa
ignatyevna
who
opened
the
garden
gate
to
him
grigory
it
appeared
was
ill
in
bed
in
the
lodge
told
him
in
answer
to
his
question
that
ivan
fyodorovitch
had
gone
out
two
hours
ago
and
my
father
he
is
up
taking
his
coffee
marfa
answered
somewhat
dryly
alyosha
went
in
the
old
man
was
sitting
alone
at
the
table
wearing
slippers
and
a
little
old
overcoat
he
was
amusing
himself
by
looking
through
some
accounts
rather
inattentively
however
he
was
quite
alone
in
the
house
for
smerdyakov
too
had
gone
out
marketing
though
he
had
got
up
early
and
was
trying
to
put
a
bold
face
on
it
he
looked
tired
and
weak
his
forehead
upon
which
huge
purple
bruises
had
come
out
during
the
night
was
bandaged
with
a
red
handkerchief
his
nose
too
had
swollen
terribly
in
the
night
and
some
smaller
bruises
covered
it
in
patches
giving
his
whole
face
a
peculiarly
spiteful
and
irritable
look
the
old
man
was
aware
of
this
and
turned
a
hostile
glance
on
alyosha
as
he
came
in
the
coffee
is
cold
he
cried
harshly
i
won
t
offer
you
any
i
ve
ordered
nothing
but
a
lenten
fish
soup
to
day
and
i
don
t
invite
any
one
to
share
it
why
have
you
come
to
find
out
how
you
are
said
alyosha
yes
besides
i
told
you
to
come
yesterday
it
s
all
of
no
consequence
you
need
not
have
troubled
but
i
knew
you
d
come
poking
in
directly
he
said
this
with
almost
hostile
feeling
at
the
same
time
he
got
up
and
looked
anxiously
in
the
looking
glass
perhaps
for
the
fortieth
time
that
morning
at
his
nose
he
began
too
binding
his
red
handkerchief
more
becomingly
on
his
forehead
red
s
better
it
s
just
like
the
hospital
in
a
white
one
he
observed
sententiously
well
how
are
things
over
there
how
is
your
elder
he
is
very
bad
he
may
die
to
day
answered
alyosha
but
his
father
had
not
listened
and
had
forgotten
his
own
question
at
once
ivan
s
gone
out
he
said
suddenly
he
is
doing
his
utmost
to
carry
off
mitya
s
betrothed
that
s
what
he
is
staying
here
for
he
added
maliciously
and
twisting
his
mouth
looked
at
alyosha
surely
he
did
not
tell
you
so
asked
alyosha
yes
he
did
long
ago
would
you
believe
it
he
told
me
three
weeks
ago
you
don
t
suppose
he
too
came
to
murder
me
do
you
he
must
have
had
some
object
in
coming
what
do
you
mean
why
do
you
say
such
things
said
alyosha
troubled
he
doesn
t
ask
for
money
it
s
true
but
yet
he
won
t
get
a
farthing
from
me
i
intend
living
as
long
as
possible
you
may
as
well
know
my
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
and
so
i
need
every
farthing
and
the
longer
i
live
the
more
i
shall
need
it
he
continued
pacing
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
keeping
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
loose
greasy
overcoat
made
of
yellow
cotton
material
i
can
still
pass
for
a
man
at
five
and
fifty
but
i
want
to
pass
for
one
for
another
twenty
years
as
i
get
older
you
know
i
shan
t
be
a
pretty
object
the
wenches
won
t
come
to
me
of
their
own
accord
so
i
shall
want
my
money
so
i
am
saving
up
more
and
more
simply
for
myself
my
dear
son
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
may
as
well
know
for
i
mean
to
go
on
in
my
sins
to
the
end
let
me
tell
you
for
sin
is
sweet
all
abuse
it
but
all
men
live
in
it
only
others
do
it
on
the
sly
and
i
openly
and
so
all
the
other
sinners
fall
upon
me
for
being
so
simple
and
your
paradise
alexey
fyodorovitch
is
not
to
my
taste
let
me
tell
you
that
and
it
s
not
the
proper
place
for
a
gentleman
your
paradise
even
if
it
exists
i
believe
that
i
fall
asleep
and
don
t
wake
up
again
and
that
s
all
you
can
pray
for
my
soul
if
you
like
and
if
you
don
t
want
to
don
t
damn
you
that
s
my
philosophy
ivan
talked
well
here
yesterday
though
we
were
all
drunk
ivan
is
a
conceited
coxcomb
but
he
has
no
particular
learning
nor
education
either
he
sits
silent
and
smiles
at
one
without
speaking
that
s
what
pulls
him
through
alyosha
listened
to
him
in
silence
why
won
t
he
talk
to
me
if
he
does
speak
he
gives
himself
airs
your
ivan
is
a
scoundrel
and
i
ll
marry
grushenka
in
a
minute
if
i
want
to
for
if
you
ve
money
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
have
only
to
want
a
thing
and
you
can
have
it
that
s
what
ivan
is
afraid
of
he
is
on
the
watch
to
prevent
me
getting
married
and
that
s
why
he
is
egging
on
mitya
to
marry
grushenka
himself
he
hopes
to
keep
me
from
grushenka
by
that
as
though
i
should
leave
him
my
money
if
i
don
t
marry
her
besides
if
mitya
marries
grushenka
ivan
will
carry
off
his
rich
betrothed
that
s
what
he
s
reckoning
on
he
is
a
scoundrel
your
ivan
how
cross
you
are
it
s
because
of
yesterday
you
had
better
lie
down
said
alyosha
there
you
say
that
the
old
man
observed
suddenly
as
though
it
had
struck
him
for
the
first
time
and
i
am
not
angry
with
you
but
if
ivan
said
it
i
should
be
angry
with
him
it
is
only
with
you
i
have
good
moments
else
you
know
i
am
an
ill
natured
man
you
are
not
ill
natured
but
distorted
said
alyosha
with
a
smile
listen
i
meant
this
morning
to
get
that
ruffian
mitya
locked
up
and
i
don
t
know
now
what
i
shall
decide
about
it
of
course
in
these
fashionable
days
fathers
and
mothers
are
looked
upon
as
a
prejudice
but
even
now
the
law
does
not
allow
you
to
drag
your
old
father
about
by
the
hair
to
kick
him
in
the
face
in
his
own
house
and
brag
of
murdering
him
outright
all
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
if
i
liked
i
could
crush
him
and
could
have
him
locked
up
at
once
for
what
he
did
yesterday
then
you
don
t
mean
to
take
proceedings
ivan
has
dissuaded
me
i
shouldn
t
care
about
ivan
but
there
s
another
thing
and
bending
down
to
alyosha
he
went
on
in
a
confidential
half
whisper
if
i
send
the
ruffian
to
prison
she
ll
hear
of
it
and
run
to
see
him
at
once
but
if
she
hears
that
he
has
beaten
me
a
weak
old
man
within
an
inch
of
my
life
she
may
give
him
up
and
come
to
me
for
that
s
her
way
everything
by
contraries
i
know
her
through
and
through
won
t
you
have
a
drop
of
brandy
take
some
cold
coffee
and
i
ll
pour
a
quarter
of
a
glass
of
brandy
into
it
it
s
delicious
my
boy
no
thank
you
i
ll
take
that
roll
with
me
if
i
may
said
alyosha
and
taking
a
halfpenny
french
roll
he
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
cassock
and
you
d
better
not
have
brandy
either
he
suggested
apprehensively
looking
into
the
old
man
s
face
you
are
quite
right
it
irritates
my
nerves
instead
of
soothing
them
only
one
little
glass
i
ll
get
it
out
of
the
cupboard
he
unlocked
the
cupboard
poured
out
a
glass
drank
it
then
locked
the
cupboard
and
put
the
key
back
in
his
pocket
that
s
enough
one
glass
won
t
kill
me
you
see
you
are
in
a
better
humor
now
said
alyosha
smiling
um
i
love
you
even
without
the
brandy
but
with
scoundrels
i
am
a
scoundrel
ivan
is
not
going
to
tchermashnya
why
is
that
he
wants
to
spy
how
much
i
give
grushenka
if
she
comes
they
are
all
scoundrels
but
i
don
t
recognize
ivan
i
don
t
know
him
at
all
where
does
he
come
from
he
is
not
one
of
us
in
soul
as
though
i
d
leave
him
anything
i
shan
t
leave
a
will
at
all
you
may
as
well
know
and
i
ll
crush
mitya
like
a
beetle
i
squash
black
beetles
at
night
with
my
slipper
they
squelch
when
you
tread
on
them
and
your
mitya
will
squelch
too
your
mitya
for
you
love
him
yes
you
love
him
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
loving
him
but
if
ivan
loved
him
i
should
be
afraid
for
myself
at
his
loving
him
but
ivan
loves
nobody
ivan
is
not
one
of
us
people
like
ivan
are
not
our
sort
my
boy
they
are
like
a
cloud
of
dust
when
the
wind
blows
the
dust
will
be
gone
i
had
a
silly
idea
in
my
head
when
i
told
you
to
come
to
day
i
wanted
to
find
out
from
you
about
mitya
if
i
were
to
hand
him
over
a
thousand
or
maybe
two
now
would
the
beggarly
wretch
agree
to
take
himself
off
altogether
for
five
years
or
better
still
thirty
five
and
without
grushenka
and
give
her
up
once
for
all
eh
i
i
ll
ask
him
muttered
alyosha
if
you
would
give
him
three
thousand
perhaps
he
that
s
nonsense
you
needn
t
ask
him
now
no
need
i
ve
changed
my
mind
it
was
a
nonsensical
idea
of
mine
i
won
t
give
him
anything
not
a
penny
i
want
my
money
myself
cried
the
old
man
waving
his
hand
i
ll
crush
him
like
a
beetle
without
it
don
t
say
anything
to
him
or
else
he
will
begin
hoping
there
s
nothing
for
you
to
do
here
you
needn
t
stay
is
that
betrothed
of
his
katerina
ivanovna
whom
he
has
kept
so
carefully
hidden
from
me
all
this
time
going
to
marry
him
or
not
you
went
to
see
her
yesterday
i
believe
nothing
will
induce
her
to
abandon
him
there
you
see
how
dearly
these
fine
young
ladies
love
a
rake
and
a
scoundrel
they
are
poor
creatures
i
tell
you
those
pale
young
ladies
very
different
from
ah
if
i
had
his
youth
and
the
looks
i
had
then
for
i
was
better
looking
than
he
at
eight
and
twenty
i
d
have
been
a
conquering
hero
just
as
he
is
he
is
a
low
cad
but
he
shan
t
have
grushenka
anyway
he
shan
t
i
ll
crush
him
his
anger
had
returned
with
the
last
words
you
can
go
there
s
nothing
for
you
to
do
here
to
day
he
snapped
harshly
alyosha
went
up
to
say
good
by
to
him
and
kissed
him
on
the
shoulder
what
s
that
for
the
old
man
was
a
little
surprised
we
shall
see
each
other
again
or
do
you
think
we
shan
t
not
at
all
i
didn
t
mean
anything
nor
did
i
i
did
not
mean
anything
said
the
old
man
looking
at
him
listen
listen
he
shouted
after
him
make
haste
and
come
again
and
i
ll
have
a
fish
soup
for
you
a
fine
one
not
like
to
day
be
sure
to
come
come
to
morrow
do
you
hear
to
morrow
and
as
soon
as
alyosha
had
gone
out
of
the
door
he
went
to
the
cupboard
again
and
poured
out
another
half
glass
i
won
t
have
more
he
muttered
clearing
his
throat
and
again
he
locked
the
cupboard
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
then
he
went
into
his
bedroom
lay
down
on
the
bed
exhausted
and
in
one
minute
he
was
asleep
chapter
iii
a
meeting
with
the
schoolboys
thank
goodness
he
did
not
ask
me
about
grushenka
thought
alyosha
as
he
left
his
father
s
house
and
turned
towards
madame
hohlakov
s
or
i
might
have
to
tell
him
of
my
meeting
with
grushenka
yesterday
alyosha
felt
painfully
that
since
yesterday
both
combatants
had
renewed
their
energies
and
that
their
hearts
had
grown
hard
again
father
is
spiteful
and
angry
he
s
made
some
plan
and
will
stick
to
it
and
what
of
dmitri
he
too
will
be
harder
than
yesterday
he
too
must
be
spiteful
and
angry
and
he
too
no
doubt
has
made
some
plan
oh
i
must
succeed
in
finding
him
to
day
whatever
happens
but
alyosha
had
not
long
to
meditate
an
incident
occurred
on
the
road
which
though
apparently
of
little
consequence
made
a
great
impression
on
him
just
after
he
had
crossed
the
square
and
turned
the
corner
coming
out
into
mihailovsky
street
which
is
divided
by
a
small
ditch
from
the
high
street
our
whole
town
is
intersected
by
ditches
he
saw
a
group
of
schoolboys
between
the
ages
of
nine
and
twelve
at
the
bridge
they
were
going
home
from
school
some
with
their
bags
on
their
shoulders
others
with
leather
satchels
slung
across
them
some
in
short
jackets
others
in
little
overcoats
some
even
had
those
high
boots
with
creases
round
the
ankles
such
as
little
boys
spoilt
by
rich
fathers
love
to
wear
the
whole
group
was
talking
eagerly
about
something
apparently
holding
a
council
alyosha
had
never
from
his
moscow
days
been
able
to
pass
children
without
taking
notice
of
them
and
although
he
was
particularly
fond
of
children
of
three
or
thereabout
he
liked
schoolboys
of
ten
and
eleven
too
and
so
anxious
as
he
was
to
day
he
wanted
at
once
to
turn
aside
to
talk
to
them
he
looked
into
their
excited
rosy
faces
and
noticed
at
once
that
all
the
boys
had
stones
in
their
hands
behind
the
ditch
some
thirty
paces
away
there
was
another
schoolboy
standing
by
a
fence
he
too
had
a
satchel
at
his
side
he
was
about
ten
years
old
pale
delicate
looking
and
with
sparkling
black
eyes
he
kept
an
attentive
and
anxious
watch
on
the
other
six
obviously
his
schoolfellows
with
whom
he
had
just
come
out
of
school
but
with
whom
he
had
evidently
had
a
feud
alyosha
went
up
and
addressing
a
fair
curly
headed
rosy
boy
in
a
black
jacket
observed
when
i
used
to
wear
a
satchel
like
yours
i
always
used
to
carry
it
on
my
left
side
so
as
to
have
my
right
hand
free
but
you
ve
got
yours
on
your
right
side
so
it
will
be
awkward
for
you
to
get
at
it
alyosha
had
no
art
or
premeditation
in
beginning
with
this
practical
remark
but
it
is
the
only
way
for
a
grown
up
person
to
get
at
once
into
confidential
relations
with
a
child
or
still
more
with
a
group
of
children
one
must
begin
in
a
serious
businesslike
way
so
as
to
be
on
a
perfectly
equal
footing
alyosha
understood
it
by
instinct
but
he
is
left
handed
another
a
fine
healthy
looking
boy
of
eleven
answered
promptly
all
the
others
stared
at
alyosha
he
even
throws
stones
with
his
left
hand
observed
a
third
at
that
instant
a
stone
flew
into
the
group
but
only
just
grazed
the
left
handed
boy
though
it
was
well
and
vigorously
thrown
by
the
boy
standing
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
give
it
him
hit
him
back
smurov
they
all
shouted
but
smurov
the
left
handed
boy
needed
no
telling
and
at
once
revenged
himself
he
threw
a
stone
but
it
missed
the
boy
and
hit
the
ground
the
boy
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
the
pocket
of
whose
coat
was
visibly
bulging
with
stones
flung
another
stone
at
the
group
this
time
it
flew
straight
at
alyosha
and
hit
him
painfully
on
the
shoulder
he
aimed
it
at
you
he
meant
it
for
you
you
are
karamazov
karamazov
the
boys
shouted
laughing
come
all
throw
at
him
at
once
and
six
stones
flew
at
the
boy
one
struck
the
boy
on
the
head
and
he
fell
down
but
at
once
leapt
up
and
began
ferociously
returning
their
fire
both
sides
threw
stones
incessantly
many
of
the
group
had
their
pockets
full
too
what
are
you
about
aren
t
you
ashamed
six
against
one
why
you
ll
kill
him
cried
alyosha
he
ran
forward
and
met
the
flying
stones
to
screen
the
solitary
boy
three
or
four
ceased
throwing
for
a
minute
he
began
first
cried
a
boy
in
a
red
shirt
in
an
angry
childish
voice
he
is
a
beast
he
stabbed
krassotkin
in
class
the
other
day
with
a
penknife
it
bled
krassotkin
wouldn
t
tell
tales
but
he
must
be
thrashed
but
what
for
i
suppose
you
tease
him
there
he
sent
a
stone
in
your
back
again
he
knows
you
cried
the
children
it
s
you
he
is
throwing
at
now
not
us
come
all
of
you
at
him
again
don
t
miss
smurov
and
again
a
fire
of
stones
and
a
very
vicious
one
began
the
boy
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
was
hit
in
the
chest
he
screamed
began
to
cry
and
ran
away
uphill
towards
mihailovsky
street
they
all
shouted
aha
he
is
funking
he
is
running
away
wisp
of
tow
you
don
t
know
what
a
beast
he
is
karamazov
killing
is
too
good
for
him
said
the
boy
in
the
jacket
with
flashing
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
the
eldest
what
s
wrong
with
him
asked
alyosha
is
he
a
tell
tale
or
what
the
boys
looked
at
one
another
as
though
derisively
are
you
going
that
way
to
mihailovsky
the
same
boy
went
on
catch
him
up
you
see
he
s
stopped
again
he
is
waiting
and
looking
at
you
he
is
looking
at
you
the
other
boys
chimed
in
you
ask
him
does
he
like
a
disheveled
wisp
of
tow
do
you
hear
ask
him
that
there
was
a
general
burst
of
laughter
alyosha
looked
at
them
and
they
at
him
don
t
go
near
him
he
ll
hurt
you
cried
smurov
in
a
warning
voice
i
shan
t
ask
him
about
the
wisp
of
tow
for
i
expect
you
tease
him
with
that
question
somehow
but
i
ll
find
out
from
him
why
you
hate
him
so
find
out
then
find
out
cried
the
boys
laughing
alyosha
crossed
the
bridge
and
walked
uphill
by
the
fence
straight
towards
the
boy
you
d
better
look
out
the
boys
called
after
him
he
won
t
be
afraid
of
you
he
will
stab
you
in
a
minute
on
the
sly
as
he
did
krassotkin
the
boy
waited
for
him
without
budging
coming
up
to
him
alyosha
saw
facing
him
a
child
of
about
nine
years
old
he
was
an
undersized
weakly
boy
with
a
thin
pale
face
with
large
dark
eyes
that
gazed
at
him
vindictively
he
was
dressed
in
a
rather
shabby
old
overcoat
which
he
had
monstrously
outgrown
his
bare
arms
stuck
out
beyond
his
sleeves
there
was
a
large
patch
on
the
right
knee
of
his
trousers
and
in
his
right
boot
just
at
the
toe
there
was
a
big
hole
in
the
leather
carefully
blackened
with
ink
both
the
pockets
of
his
great
coat
were
weighed
down
with
stones
alyosha
stopped
two
steps
in
front
of
him
looking
inquiringly
at
him
the
boy
seeing
at
once
from
alyosha
s
eyes
that
he
wouldn
t
beat
him
became
less
defiant
and
addressed
him
first
i
am
alone
and
there
are
six
of
them
i
ll
beat
them
all
alone
he
said
suddenly
with
flashing
eyes
i
think
one
of
the
stones
must
have
hurt
you
badly
observed
alyosha
but
i
hit
smurov
on
the
head
cried
the
boy
they
told
me
that
you
know
me
and
that
you
threw
a
stone
at
me
on
purpose
said
alyosha
the
boy
looked
darkly
at
him
i
don
t
know
you
do
you
know
me
alyosha
continued
let
me
alone
the
boy
cried
irritably
but
he
did
not
move
as
though
he
were
expecting
something
and
again
there
was
a
vindictive
light
in
his
eyes
very
well
i
am
going
said
alyosha
only
i
don
t
know
you
and
i
don
t
tease
you
they
told
me
how
they
tease
you
but
i
don
t
want
to
tease
you
good
by
monk
in
silk
trousers
cried
the
boy
following
alyosha
with
the
same
vindictive
and
defiant
expression
and
he
threw
himself
into
an
attitude
of
defense
feeling
sure
that
now
alyosha
would
fall
upon
him
but
alyosha
turned
looked
at
him
and
walked
away
he
had
not
gone
three
steps
before
the
biggest
stone
the
boy
had
in
his
pocket
hit
him
a
painful
blow
in
the
back
so
you
ll
hit
a
man
from
behind
they
tell
the
truth
then
when
they
say
that
you
attack
on
the
sly
said
alyosha
turning
round
again
this
time
the
boy
threw
a
stone
savagely
right
into
alyosha
s
face
but
alyosha
just
had
time
to
guard
himself
and
the
stone
struck
him
on
the
elbow
aren
t
you
ashamed
what
have
i
done
to
you
he
cried
the
boy
waited
in
silent
defiance
certain
that
now
alyosha
would
attack
him
seeing
that
even
now
he
would
not
his
rage
was
like
a
little
wild
beast
s
he
flew
at
alyosha
himself
and
before
alyosha
had
time
to
move
the
spiteful
child
had
seized
his
left
hand
with
both
of
his
and
bit
his
middle
finger
he
fixed
his
teeth
in
it
and
it
was
ten
seconds
before
he
let
go
alyosha
cried
out
with
pain
and
pulled
his
finger
away
with
all
his
might
the
child
let
go
at
last
and
retreated
to
his
former
distance
alyosha
s
finger
had
been
badly
bitten
to
the
bone
close
to
the
nail
it
began
to
bleed
alyosha
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
bound
it
tightly
round
his
injured
hand
he
was
a
full
minute
bandaging
it
the
boy
stood
waiting
all
the
time
at
last
alyosha
raised
his
gentle
eyes
and
looked
at
him
very
well
he
said
you
see
how
badly
you
ve
bitten
me
that
s
enough
isn
t
it
now
tell
me
what
have
i
done
to
you
the
boy
stared
in
amazement
though
i
don
t
know
you
and
it
s
the
first
time
i
ve
seen
you
alyosha
went
on
with
the
same
serenity
yet
i
must
have
done
something
to
you
you
wouldn
t
have
hurt
me
like
this
for
nothing
so
what
have
i
done
how
have
i
wronged
you
tell
me
instead
of
answering
the
boy
broke
into
a
loud
tearful
wail
and
ran
away
alyosha
walked
slowly
after
him
towards
mihailovsky
street
and
for
a
long
time
he
saw
the
child
running
in
the
distance
as
fast
as
ever
not
turning
his
head
and
no
doubt
still
keeping
up
his
tearful
wail
he
made
up
his
mind
to
find
him
out
as
soon
as
he
had
time
and
to
solve
this
mystery
just
now
he
had
not
the
time
chapter
iv
at
the
hohlakovs
alyosha
soon
reached
madame
hohlakov
s
house
a
handsome
stone
house
of
two
stories
one
of
the
finest
in
our
town
though
madame
hohlakov
spent
most
of
her
time
in
another
province
where
she
had
an
estate
or
in
moscow
where
she
had
a
house
of
her
own
yet
she
had
a
house
in
our
town
too
inherited
from
her
forefathers
the
estate
in
our
district
was
the
largest
of
her
three
estates
yet
she
had
been
very
little
in
our
province
before
this
time
she
ran
out
to
alyosha
in
the
hall
did
you
get
my
letter
about
the
new
miracle
she
spoke
rapidly
and
nervously
yes
did
you
show
it
to
every
one
he
restored
the
son
to
his
mother
he
is
dying
to
day
said
alyosha
i
have
heard

i
long
to
talk
to
you
to
you
or
some
one
about
all

you
and
how
sorry
i

t
see
him
the
whole
town

all
suspense

alyosha

your
brother

so
shocking
yesterday
but
the
other
ivan
fyodorovitch
he
is
sitting
with
her
talking
they
are
having
a
serious
conversation
if
you
could
only
imagine
what
s
passing
between
them
now
it
s
awful
i
tell
you
it
s
lacerating
it
s
like
some
incredible
tale
of
horror
they
are
ruining
their
lives
for
no
reason
any
one
can
see
they
both
recognize
it
and
revel
in
it
i
ve
been
watching
for
you
i

been
thirsting

you
it

too
much
for
me

most
important
thing

most
important

to
be
hysterical
maman
it

you

hysterical
now
not
i
lise
s
voice
caroled
through
a
tiny
crack
of
the
door
at
the
side
her
voice
sounded
as
though
she
wanted
to
laugh
but
was
doing
her
utmost
to
control
it
alyosha
at
once
noticed
the
crack
and
no
doubt
lise
was
peeping
through
it
but
that
he
could
not
see
and
no
wonder
lise
no
wonder
your
caprices
will
make
me
hysterical
too
but
she
is
so
ill
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
has
been
so
ill
all

feverish
and
moaning
i

the
morning
and
for
herzenstube
to
come
he
says
that
he
can
make
nothing
of
it
that
we
must
wait
herzenstube
always
comes
and
says
that
he
can
make
nothing
of
it
as
soon
as
you
approached
the
house
she
screamed
fell
into
hysterics
and
insisted
on
being
wheeled
back
into
this
room
here
mamma
i

t

clever

honored
visitor
alexey
fyodorovitch
that
he
has
shown
his
want
of

of

everything

even
that
miracle

upset
me
how
it
has
shattered
me

miracle

tragedy
in
the
drawing
room
it
s
more
than
i

a
comedy
perhaps

tragedy

he
oh
my
god
what

happening
to

minute
i
close
my
eyes
and
see
that
it
s
all
nonsense
all
nonsense
i
should
be
very
grateful
alyosha
interrupted
suddenly
if
you
could
give
me
a
clean
rag
to
bind
up
my
finger
with
i
have
hurt
it
and
it
s
very
painful
alyosha
unbound
his
bitten
finger
the
handkerchief
was
soaked
with
blood
madame
hohlakov
screamed
and
shut
her
eyes
good
heavens
what
a
wound
how
awful
but
as
soon
as
lise
saw
alyosha
s
finger
through
the
crack
she
flung
the
door
wide
open
come
come
here
she
cried
imperiously
no
nonsense
now
good
heavens
why
did
you
stand
there
saying
nothing
about
it
all
this
time
he
might
have
bled
to
death
mamma
how
did
you
do
it
water
water
you
must
wash
it
first
of
all
simply
hold
it
in
cold
water
to
stop
the
pain
and
keep
it
there
keep
it
there
make
haste
mamma
some
water
in
a
slop
basin
but
do
make
haste
she
finished
nervously
she
was
quite
frightened
at
the
sight
of
alyosha
s
wound
shouldn
t
we
send
for
herzenstube
cried
madame
hohlakov
mamma
you
ll
be
the
death
of
me
your
herzenstube
will
come
and
say
that
he
can
make
nothing
of
it
water
water
mamma
for
goodness
sake
go
yourself
and
hurry
yulia
she
is
such
a
slowcoach
and
never
can
come
quickly
make
haste
mamma
or
i
shall
die
why
it
s
nothing
much
cried
alyosha
frightened
at
this
alarm
yulia
ran
in
with
water
and
alyosha
put
his
finger
in
it
some
lint
mamma
for
mercy
s
sake
bring
some
lint
and
that
muddy
caustic
lotion
for
wounds
what
s
it
called
we
ve
got
some
you
know
where
the
bottle
is
mamma
it
s
in
your
bedroom
in
the
right
hand
cupboard
there
s
a
big
bottle
of
it
there
with
the
lint
i
ll
bring
everything
in
a
minute
lise
only
don
t
scream
and
don
t
fuss
you
see
how
bravely
alexey
fyodorovitch
bears
it
where
did
you
get
such
a
dreadful
wound
alexey
fyodorovitch
madame
hohlakov
hastened
away
this
was
all
lise
was
waiting
for
first
of
all
answer
the
question
where
did
you
get
hurt
like
this
she
asked
alyosha
quickly
and
then
i
ll
talk
to
you
about
something
quite
different
well
instinctively
feeling
that
the
time
of
her
mother
s
absence
was
precious
for
her
alyosha
hastened
to
tell
her
of
his
enigmatic
meeting
with
the
schoolboys
in
the
fewest
words
possible
lise
clasped
her
hands
at
his
story
how
can
you
and
in
that
dress
too
associate
with
schoolboys
she
cried
angrily
as
though
she
had
a
right
to
control
him
you
are
nothing
but
a
boy
yourself
if
you
can
do
that
a
perfect
boy
but
you
must
find
out
for
me
about
that
horrid
boy
and
tell
me
all
about
it
for
there
s
some
mystery
in
it
now
for
the
second
thing
but
first
a
question
does
the
pain
prevent
you
talking
about
utterly
unimportant
things
but
talking
sensibly
of
course
not
and
i
don
t
feel
much
pain
now
that
s
because
your
finger
is
in
the
water
it
must
be
changed
directly
for
it
will
get
warm
in
a
minute
yulia
bring
some
ice
from
the
cellar
and
another
basin
of
water
now
she
is
gone
i
can
speak
will
you
give
me
the
letter
i
sent
you
yesterday
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
be
quick
for
mamma
will
be
back
in
a
minute
and
i
don
t
want
i
haven
t
got
the
letter
that
s
not
true
you
have
i
knew
you
would
say
that
you
ve
got
it
in
that
pocket
i
ve
been
regretting
that
joke
all
night
give
me
back
the
letter
at
once
give
it
me
i
ve
left
it
at
home
but
you
can
t
consider
me
as
a
child
a
little
girl
after
that
silly
joke
i
beg
your
pardon
for
that
silliness
but
you
must
bring
me
the
letter
if
you
really
haven
t
got
it
bring
it
to
day
you
must
you
must
to
day
i
can
t
possibly
for
i
am
going
back
to
the
monastery
and
i
shan
t
come
and
see
you
for
the
next
two
days
three
or
four
perhaps
for
father
zossima
four
days
what
nonsense
listen
did
you
laugh
at
me
very
much
i
didn
t
laugh
at
all
why
not
because
i
believed
all
you
said
you
are
insulting
me
not
at
all
as
soon
as
i
read
it
i
thought
that
all
that
would
come
to
pass
for
as
soon
as
father
zossima
dies
i
am
to
leave
the
monastery
then
i
shall
go
back
and
finish
my
studies
and
when
you
reach
the
legal
age
we
will
be
married
i
shall
love
you
though
i
haven
t
had
time
to
think
about
it
i
believe
i
couldn
t
find
a
better
wife
than
you
and
father
zossima
tells
me
i
must
marry
but
i
am
a
cripple
wheeled
about
in
a
chair
laughed
lise
flushing
crimson
i
ll
wheel
you
about
myself
but
i
m
sure
you
ll
get
well
by
then
but
you
are
mad
said
lise
nervously
to
make
all
this
nonsense
out
of
a
joke
here
s
mamma
very
propos
perhaps
mamma
how
slow
you
always
are
how
can
you
be
so
long
and
here
s
yulia
with
the
ice
oh
lise
don
t
scream
above
all
things
don
t
scream
that
scream
drives
me
how
can
i
help
it
when
you
put
the
lint
in
another
place
i
ve
been
hunting
and
hunting
i
do
believe
you
did
it
on
purpose
but
i
couldn
t
tell
that
he
would
come
with
a
bad
finger
or
else
perhaps
i
might
have
done
it
on
purpose
my
darling
mamma
you
begin
to
say
really
witty
things
never
mind
my
being
witty
but
i
must
say
you
show
nice
feeling
for
alexey
fyodorovitch
s
sufferings
oh
my
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
what
s
killing
me
is
no
one
thing
in
particular
not
herzenstube
but
everything
together
that
s
what
is
too
much
for
me
that
s
enough
mamma
enough
about
herzenstube
lise
laughed
gayly
make
haste
with
the
lint
and
the
lotion
mamma
that
s
simply
goulard
s
water
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
remember
the
name
now
but
it
s
a
splendid
lotion
would
you
believe
it
mamma
on
the
way
here
he
had
a
fight
with
the
boys
in
the
street
and
it
was
a
boy
bit
his
finger
isn
t
he
a
child
a
child
himself
is
he
fit
to
be
married
after
that
for
only
fancy
he
wants
to
be
married
mamma
just
think
of
him
married
wouldn
t
it
be
funny
wouldn
t
it
be
awful
and
lise
kept
laughing
her
thin
hysterical
giggle
looking
slyly
at
alyosha
but
why
married
lise
what
makes
you
talk
of
such
a
thing
it
s
quite
out
of
place
and
perhaps
the
boy
was
rabid
why
mamma
as
though
there
were
rabid
boys
why
not
lise
as
though
i
had
said
something
stupid
your
boy
might
have
been
bitten
by
a
mad
dog
and
he
would
become
mad
and
bite
any
one
near
him
how
well
she
has
bandaged
it
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
couldn
t
have
done
it
do
you
still
feel
the
pain
it
s
nothing
much
now
you
don
t
feel
afraid
of
water
asked
lise
come
that
s
enough
lise
perhaps
i
really
was
rather
too
quick
talking
of
the
boy
being
rabid
and
you
pounced
upon
it
at
once
katerina
ivanovna
has
only
just
heard
that
you
are
here
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
simply
rushed
at
me
she
s
dying
to
see
you
dying
ach
mamma
go
to
them
yourself
he
can
t
go
just
now
he
is
in
too
much
pain
not
at
all
i
can
go
quite
well
said
alyosha

say
well
when
i
ve
seen
them
i
ll
come
back
here
and
we
can
talk
as
much
as

once
for
i
am
very
anxious
to
be
back

the
monastery
as
soon
as
i
can
mamma
take
him
away
quickly
alexey
fyodorovitch
don

and
a

alexey
fyodorovitch
she

too
capricious
to
day
i
am
afraid
to

trouble

girls
perhaps
she
really
will
be
able
to
sleep
after

made
her
sleepy
and
how
fortunate
it

mamma
and
i

lise

alexey
fyodorovitch
madame
hohlakov
began
mysteriously
and
importantly
speaking
in
a
rapid
whisper
i
don
t
want
to
suggest
anything
i
don
t
want
to
lift
the
veil
you
will
see
for
yourself
what
s
going
on
it
s
appalling
it
s
the
most
fantastic
farce
she
loves
your
brother

to

chapter
v
a
laceration
in
the
drawing
room
but
in
the
drawing
room
the
conversation
was
already
over
katerina
ivanovna
was
greatly
excited
though
she
looked
resolute
at
the
moment
alyosha
and
madame
hohlakov
entered
ivan
fyodorovitch
stood
up
to
take
leave
his
face
was
rather
pale
and
alyosha
looked
at
him
anxiously
for
this
moment
was
to
solve
a
doubt
a
harassing
enigma
which
had
for
some
time
haunted
alyosha
during
the
preceding
month
it
had
been
several
times
suggested
to
him
that
his
brother
ivan
was
in
love
with
katerina
ivanovna
and
what
was
more
that
he
meant
to
carry
her
off
from
dmitri
until
quite
lately
the
idea
seemed
to
alyosha
monstrous
though
it
worried
him
extremely
he
loved
both
his
brothers
and
dreaded
such
rivalry
between
them
meantime
dmitri
had
said
outright
on
the
previous
day
that
he
was
glad
that
ivan
was
his
rival
and
that
it
was
a
great
assistance
to
him
dmitri
in
what
way
did
it
assist
him
to
marry
grushenka
but
that
alyosha
considered
the
worst
thing
possible
besides
all
this
alyosha
had
till
the
evening
before
implicitly
believed
that
katerina
ivanovna
had
a
steadfast
and
passionate
love
for
dmitri
but
he
had
only
believed
it
till
the
evening
before
he
had
fancied
too
that
she
was
incapable
of
loving
a
man
like
ivan
and
that
she
did
love
dmitri
and
loved
him
just
as
he
was
in
spite
of
all
the
strangeness
of
such
a
passion
but
during
yesterday
s
scene
with
grushenka
another
idea
had
struck
him
the
word
lacerating
which
madame
hohlakov
had
just
uttered
almost
made
him
start
because
half
waking
up
towards
daybreak
that
night
he
had
cried
out
laceration
laceration
probably
applying
it
to
his
dream
he
had
been
dreaming
all
night
of
the
previous
day
s
scene
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
now
alyosha
was
impressed
by
madame
hohlakov
s
blunt
and
persistent
assertion
that
katerina
ivanovna
was
in
love
with
ivan
and
only
deceived
herself
through
some
sort
of
pose
from
self
laceration
and
tortured
herself
by
her
pretended
love
for
dmitri
from
some
fancied
duty
of
gratitude
yes
he
thought
perhaps
the
whole
truth
lies
in
those
words
but
in
that
case
what
was
ivan
s
position
alyosha
felt
instinctively
that
a
character
like
katerina
ivanovna
s
must
dominate
and
she
could
only
dominate
some
one
like
dmitri
and
never
a
man
like
ivan
for
dmitri
might
at
last
submit
to
her
domination
to
his
own
happiness
which
was
what
alyosha
would
have
desired
but
ivan
no
ivan
could
not
submit
to
her
and
such
submission
would
not
give
him
happiness
alyosha
could
not
help
believing
that
of
ivan
and
now
all
these
doubts
and
reflections
flitted
through
his
mind
as
he
entered
the
drawing
room
another
idea
too
forced
itself
upon
him
what
if
she
loved
neither
of
them
neither
ivan
nor
dmitri
it
must
be
noted
that
alyosha
felt
as
it
were
ashamed
of
his
own
thoughts
and
blamed
himself
when
they
kept
recurring
to
him
during
the
last
month
what
do
i
know
about
love
and
women
and
how
can
i
decide
such
questions
he
thought
reproachfully
after
such
doubts
and
surmises
and
yet
it
was
impossible
not
to
think
about
it
he
felt
instinctively
that
this
rivalry
was
of
immense
importance
in
his
brothers
lives
and
that
a
great
deal
depended
upon
it
one
reptile
will
devour
the
other
ivan
had
pronounced
the
day
before
speaking
in
anger
of
his
father
and
dmitri
so
ivan
looked
upon
dmitri
as
a
reptile
and
perhaps
had
long
done
so
was
it
perhaps
since
he
had
known
katerina
ivanovna
that
phrase
had
of
course
escaped
ivan
unawares
yesterday
but
that
only
made
it
more
important
if
he
felt
like
that
what
chance
was
there
of
peace
were
there
not
on
the
contrary
new
grounds
for
hatred
and
hostility
in
their
family
and
with
which
of
them
was
alyosha
to
sympathize
and
what
was
he
to
wish
for
each
of
them
he
loved
them
both
but
what
could
he
desire
for
each
in
the
midst
of
these
conflicting
interests
he
might
go
quite
astray
in
this
maze
and
alyosha
s
heart
could
not
endure
uncertainty
because
his
love
was
always
of
an
active
character
he
was
incapable
of
passive
love
if
he
loved
any
one
he
set
to
work
at
once
to
help
him
and
to
do
so
he
must
know
what
he
was
aiming
at
he
must
know
for
certain
what
was
best
for
each
and
having
ascertained
this
it
was
natural
for
him
to
help
them
both
but
instead
of
a
definite
aim
he
found
nothing
but
uncertainty
and
perplexity
on
all
sides
it
was
lacerating
as
was
said
just
now
but
what
could
he
understand
even
in
this
laceration
he
did
not
understand
the
first
word
in
this
perplexing
maze
seeing
alyosha
katerina
ivanovna
said
quickly
and
joyfully
to
ivan
who
had
already
got
up
to
go
a
minute
stay
another
minute
i
want
to
hear
the
opinion
of
this
person
here
whom
i
trust
absolutely
don
t
go
away
she
added
addressing
madame
hohlakov
she
made
alyosha
sit
down
beside
her
and
madame
hohlakov
sat
opposite
by
ivan
you
are
all
my
friends
here
all
i
have
in
the
world
my
dear
friends
she
began
warmly
in
a
voice
which
quivered
with
genuine
tears
of
suffering
and
alyosha
s
heart
warmed
to
her
at
once
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
were
witness
yesterday
of
that
abominable
scene
and
saw
what
i
did
you
did
not
see
it
ivan
fyodorovitch
he
did
what
he
thought
of
me
yesterday
i
don
t
know
i
only
know
one
thing
that
if
it
were
repeated
to
day
this
minute
i
should
express
the
same
feelings
again
as
yesterday
the
same
feelings
the
same
words
the
same
actions
you
remember
my
actions
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
checked
me
in
one
of
them
as
she
said
that
she
flushed
and
her
eyes
shone
i
must
tell
you
that
i
can
t
get
over
it
listen
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
don
t
even
know
whether
i
still
love
him
i
feel
pity
for
him
and
that
is
a
poor
sign
of
love
if
i
loved
him
if
i
still
loved
him
perhaps
i
shouldn
t
be
sorry
for
him
now
but
should
hate
him
her
voice
quivered
and
tears
glittered
on
her
eyelashes
alyosha
shuddered
inwardly
that
girl
is
truthful
and
sincere
he
thought
and
she
does
not
love
dmitri
any
more
that
s
true
that
s
true
cried
madame
hohlakov
wait
dear
i
haven
t
told
you
the
chief
the
final
decision
i
came
to
during
the
night
i
feel
that
perhaps
my
decision
is
a
terrible
one
for
me
but
i
foresee
that
nothing
will
induce
me
to
change
it
nothing
it
will
be
so
all
my
life
my
dear
kind
ever
faithful
and
generous
adviser
the
one
friend
i
have
in
the
world
ivan
fyodorovitch
with
his
deep
insight
into
the
heart
approves
and
commends
my
decision
he
knows
it
yes
i
approve
of
it
ivan
assented
in
a
subdued
but
firm
voice
but
i
should
like
alyosha
too
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
forgive
my
calling
you
simply
alyosha
i
should
like
alexey
fyodorovitch
too
to
tell
me
before
my
two
friends
whether
i
am
right
i
feel
instinctively
that
you
alyosha
my
dear
brother
for
you
are
a
dear
brother
to
me
she
said
again
ecstatically
taking
his
cold
hand
in
her
hot
one
i
foresee
that
your
decision
your
approval
will
bring
me
peace
in
spite
of
all
my
sufferings
for
after
your
words
i
shall
be
calm
and
submit
i
feel
that
i
don
t
know
what
you
are
asking
me
said
alyosha
flushing
i
only
know
that
i
love
you
and
at
this
moment
wish
for
your
happiness
more
than
my
own
but
i
know
nothing
about
such
affairs
something
impelled
him
to
add
hurriedly
in
such
affairs
alexey
fyodorovitch
in
such
affairs
the
chief
thing
is
honor
and
duty
and
something
higher
i
don
t
know
what
but
higher
perhaps
even
than
duty
i
am
conscious
of
this
irresistible
feeling
in
my
heart
and
it
compels
me
irresistibly
but
it
may
all
be
put
in
two
words
i
ve
already
decided
even
if
he
marries
that
creature
she
began
solemnly
whom
i
never
never
can
forgive
even
then
i
will
not
abandon
him
henceforward
i
will
never
never
abandon
him
she
cried
breaking
into
a
sort
of
pale
hysterical
ecstasy
not
that
i
would
run
after
him
continually
get
in
his
way
and
worry
him
oh
no
i
will
go
away
to
another
town
where
you
like
but
i
will
watch
over
him
all
my
life
i
will
watch
over
him
all
my
life
unceasingly
when
he
becomes
unhappy
with
that
woman
and
that
is
bound
to
happen
quite
soon
let
him
come
to
me
and
he
will
find
a
friend
a
sister
only
a
sister
of
course
and
so
for
ever
but
he
will
learn
at
least
that
that
sister
is
really
his
sister
who
loves
him
and
has
sacrificed
all
her
life
to
him
i
will
gain
my
point
i
will
insist
on
his
knowing
me
and
confiding
entirely
in
me
without
reserve
she
cried
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
i
will
be
a
god
to
whom
he
can
pray
and
that
at
least
he
owes
me
for
his
treachery
and
for
what
i
suffered
yesterday
through
him
and
let
him
see
that
all
my
life
i
will
be
true
to
him
and
the
promise
i
gave
him
in
spite
of
his
being
untrue
and
betraying
me
i
will
i
will
become
nothing
but
a
means
for
his
happiness
or
how
shall
i
say
an
instrument
a
machine
for
his
happiness
and
that
for
my
whole
life
my
whole
life
and
that
he
may
see
that
all
his
life
that
s
my
decision
ivan
fyodorovitch
fully
approves
me
she
was
breathless
she
had
perhaps
intended
to
express
her
idea
with
more
dignity
art
and
naturalness
but
her
speech
was
too
hurried
and
crude
it
was
full
of
youthful
impulsiveness
it
betrayed
that
she
was
still
smarting
from
yesterday
s
insult
and
that
her
pride
craved
satisfaction
she
felt
this
herself
her
face
suddenly
darkened
an
unpleasant
look
came
into
her
eyes
alyosha
at
once
saw
it
and
felt
a
pang
of
sympathy
his
brother
ivan
made
it
worse
by
adding
i
ve
only
expressed
my
own
view
he
said
from
any
one
else
this
would
have
been
affected
and
overstrained
but
from
you
no
any
other
woman
would
have
been
wrong
but
you
are
right
i
don
t
know
how
to
explain
it
but
i
see
that
you
are
absolutely
genuine
and
therefore
you
are
right
but
that
s
only
for
the
moment
and
what
does
this
moment
stand
for
nothing
but
yesterday
s
insult
madame
hohlakov
obviously
had
not
intended
to
interfere
but
she
could
not
refrain
from
this
very
just
comment
quite
so
quite
so
cried
ivan
with
peculiar
eagerness
obviously
annoyed
at
being
interrupted
in
any
one
else
this
moment
would
be
only
due
to
yesterday
s
impression
and
would
be
only
a
moment
but
with
katerina
ivanovna
s
character
that
moment
will
last
all
her
life
what
for
any
one
else
would
be
only
a
promise
is
for
her
an
everlasting
burdensome
grim
perhaps
but
unflagging
duty
and
she
will
be
sustained
by
the
feeling
of
this
duty
being
fulfilled
your
life
katerina
ivanovna
will
henceforth
be
spent
in
painful
brooding
over
your
own
feelings
your
own
heroism
and
your
own
suffering
but
in
the
end
that
suffering
will
be
softened
and
will
pass
into
sweet
contemplation
of
the
fulfillment
of
a
bold
and
proud
design
yes
proud
it
certainly
is
and
desperate
in
any
case
but
a
triumph
for
you
and
the
consciousness
of
it
will
at
last
be
a
source
of
complete
satisfaction
and
will
make
you
resigned
to
everything
else
this
was
unmistakably
said
with
some
malice
and
obviously
with
intention
even
perhaps
with
no
desire
to
conceal
that
he
spoke
ironically
and
with
intention
oh
dear
how
mistaken
it
all
is
madame
hohlakov
cried
again
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
speak
i
want
dreadfully
to
know
what
you
will
say
cried
katerina
ivanovna
and
burst
into
tears
alyosha
got
up
from
the
sofa
it
s
nothing
nothing
she
went
on
through
her
tears
i
m
upset
i
didn
t
sleep
last
night
but
by
the
side
of
two
such
friends
as
you
and
your
brother
i
still
feel
strong
for
i
know
you
two
will
never
desert
me
unluckily
i
am
obliged
to
return
to
moscow
perhaps
to
morrow
and
to
leave
you
for
a
long
time
and
unluckily
it
s
unavoidable
ivan
said
suddenly
to
morrow
to
moscow
her
face
was
suddenly
contorted
but
but
dear
me
how
fortunate
she
cried
in
a
voice
suddenly
changed
in
one
instant
there
was
no
trace
left
of
her
tears
she
underwent
an
instantaneous
transformation
which
amazed
alyosha
instead
of
a
poor
insulted
girl
weeping
in
a
sort
of
laceration
he
saw
a
woman
completely
self
possessed
and
even
exceedingly
pleased
as
though
something
agreeable
had
just
happened
oh
not
fortunate
that
i
am
losing
you
of
course
not
she
corrected
herself
suddenly
with
a
charming
society
smile
such
a
friend
as
you
are
could
not
suppose
that
i
am
only
too
unhappy
at
losing
you
she
rushed
impulsively
at
ivan
and
seizing
both
his
hands
pressed
them
warmly
but
what
is
fortunate
is
that
you
will
be
able
in
moscow
to
see
auntie
and
agafya
and
to
tell
them
all
the
horror
of
my
present
position
you
can
speak
with
complete
openness
to
agafya
but
spare
dear
auntie
you
will
know
how
to
do
that
you
can
t
think
how
wretched
i
was
yesterday
and
this
morning
wondering
how
i
could
write
them
that
dreadful
letter
for
one
can
never
tell
such
things
in
a
letter
now
it
will
be
easy
for
me
to
write
for
you
will
see
them
and
explain
everything
oh
how
glad
i
am
but
i
am
only
glad
of
that
believe
me
of
course
no
one
can
take
your
place
i
will
run
at
once
to
write
the
letter
she
finished
suddenly
and
took
a
step
as
though
to
go
out
of
the
room
and
what
about
alyosha
and
his
opinion
which
you
were
so
desperately
anxious
to
hear
cried
madame
hohlakov
there
was
a
sarcastic
angry
note
in
her
voice
i
had
not
forgotten
that
cried
katerina
ivanovna
coming
to
a
sudden
standstill
and
why
are
you
so
antagonistic
at
such
a
moment
she
added
with
warm
and
bitter
reproachfulness
what
i
said
i
repeat
i
must
have
his
opinion
more
than
that
i
must
have
his
decision
as
he
says
so
it
shall
be
you
see
how
anxious
i
am
for
your
words
alexey
fyodorovitch
but
what
s
the
matter
i
couldn
t
have
believed
it
i
can
t
understand
it
alyosha
cried
suddenly
in
distress
what
what
he
is
going
to
moscow
and
you
cry
out
that
you
are
glad
you
said
that
on
purpose
and
you
begin
explaining
that
you
are
not
glad
of
that
but
sorry
to
be
losing
a
friend
but
that
was
acting
too
you
were
playing
a
part
as
in
a
theater
in
a
theater
what
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
katerina
ivanovna
profoundly
astonished
flushing
crimson
and
frowning
though
you
assure
him
you
are
sorry
to
lose
a
friend
in
him
you
persist
in
telling
him
to
his
face
that
it
s
fortunate
he
is
going
said
alyosha
breathlessly
he
was
standing
at
the
table
and
did
not
sit
down
what
are
you
talking
about
i
don
t
understand
i
don
t
understand
myself
i
seemed
to
see
in
a
flash
i
know
i
am
not
saying
it
properly
but
i
ll
say
it
all
the
same
alyosha
went
on
in
the
same
shaking
and
broken
voice
what
i
see
is
that
perhaps
you
don
t
love
dmitri
at
all
and
never
have
from
the
beginning
and
dmitri
too
has
never
loved
you
and
only
esteems
you
i
really
don
t
know
how
i
dare
to
say
all
this
but
somebody
must
tell
the
truth
for
nobody
here
will
tell
the
truth
what
truth
cried
katerina
ivanovna
and
there
was
an
hysterical
ring
in
her
voice
i
ll
tell
you
alyosha
went
on
with
desperate
haste
as
though
he
were
jumping
from
the
top
of
a
house
call
dmitri
i
will
fetch
him
and
let
him
come
here
and
take
your
hand
and
take
ivan
s
and
join
your
hands
for
you
re
torturing
ivan
simply
because
you
love
him
and
torturing
him
because
you
love
dmitri
through
self
laceration
with
an
unreal
love
because
you
ve
persuaded
yourself
alyosha
broke
off
and
was
silent
you
you
you
are
a
little
religious
idiot
that
s
what
you
are
katerina
ivanovna
snapped
her
face
was
white
and
her
lips
were
moving
with
anger
ivan
suddenly
laughed
and
got
up
his
hat
was
in
his
hand
you
are
mistaken
my
good
alyosha
he
said
with
an
expression
alyosha
had
never
seen
in
his
face
before
an
expression
of
youthful
sincerity
and
strong
irresistibly
frank
feeling
katerina
ivanovna
has
never
cared
for
me
she
has
known
all
the
time
that
i
cared
for
her
though
i
never
said
a
word
of
my
love
to
her
she
knew
but
she
didn
t
care
for
me
i
have
never
been
her
friend
either
not
for
one
moment
she
is
too
proud
to
need
my
friendship
she
kept
me
at
her
side
as
a
means
of
revenge
she
revenged
with
me
and
on
me
all
the
insults
which
she
has
been
continually
receiving
from
dmitri
ever
since
their
first
meeting
for
even
that
first
meeting
has
rankled
in
her
heart
as
an
insult
that
s
what
her
heart
is
like
she
has
talked
to
me
of
nothing
but
her
love
for
him
i
am
going
now
but
believe
me
katerina
ivanovna
you
really
love
him
and
the
more
he
insults
you
the
more
you
love
him
that
s
your
laceration
you
love
him
just
as
he
is
you
love
him
for
insulting
you
if
he
reformed
you
d
give
him
up
at
once
and
cease
to
love
him
but
you
need
him
so
as
to
contemplate
continually
your
heroic
fidelity
and
to
reproach
him
for
infidelity
and
it
all
comes
from
your
pride
oh
there
s
a
great
deal
of
humiliation
and
self
abasement
about
it
but
it
all
comes
from
pride
i
am
too
young
and
i
ve
loved
you
too
much
i
know
that
i
ought
not
to
say
this
that
it
would
be
more
dignified
on
my
part
simply
to
leave
you
and
it
would
be
less
offensive
for
you
but
i
am
going
far
away
and
shall
never
come
back
it
is
for
ever
i
don
t
want
to
sit
beside
a
laceration
but
i
don
t
know
how
to
speak
now
i
ve
said
everything
good
by
katerina
ivanovna
you
can
t
be
angry
with
me
for
i
am
a
hundred
times
more
severely
punished
than
you
if
only
by
the
fact
that
i
shall
never
see
you
again
good
by
i
don
t
want
your
hand
you
have
tortured
me
too
deliberately
for
me
to
be
able
to
forgive
you
at
this
moment
i
shall
forgive
you
later
but
now
i
don
t
want
your
hand
den

he
added
with
a
forced
smile
showing
however
that
he
could
read
schiller
and
read
him
till
he
knew
him
by
heart
which
alyosha
would
never
have
believed
he
went
out
of
the
room
without
saying
good
by
even
to
his
hostess
madame
hohlakov
alyosha
clasped
his
hands
ivan
he
cried
desperately
after
him
come
back
ivan
no
nothing
will
induce
him
to
come
back
now
he
cried
again
regretfully
realizing
it
but
it
s
my
fault
my
fault
i
began
it
ivan
spoke
angrily
wrongly
unjustly
and
angrily
he
must
come
back
here
come
back
alyosha
kept
exclaiming
frantically
katerina
ivanovna
went
suddenly
into
the
next
room
you
have
done
no
harm
you
behaved
beautifully
like
an
angel
madame
hohlakov
whispered
rapidly
and
ecstatically
to
alyosha
i
will
do
my
utmost
to
prevent
ivan
fyodorovitch
from
going
her
face
beamed
with
delight
to
the
great
distress
of
alyosha
but
katerina
ivanovna
suddenly
returned
she
had
two
hundred
rouble
notes
in
her
hand
i
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
began
addressing
alyosha
with
an
apparently
calm
and
even
voice
as
though
nothing
had
happened
a
week
yes
i
think
it
was
a
week
ago
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
guilty
of
a
hasty
and
unjust
action
a
very
ugly
action
there
is
a
low
tavern
here
and
in
it
he
met
that
discharged
officer
that
captain
whom
your
father
used
to
employ
in
some
business
dmitri
fyodorovitch
somehow
lost
his
temper
with
this
captain
seized
him
by
the
beard
and
dragged
him
out
into
the
street
and
for
some
distance
along
it
in
that
insulting
fashion
and
i
am
told
that
his
son
a
boy
quite
a
child
who
is
at
the
school
here
saw
it
and
ran
beside
them
crying
and
begging
for
his
father
appealing
to
every
one
to
defend
him
while
every
one
laughed
you
must
forgive
me
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
cannot
think
without
indignation
of
that
disgraceful
action
of
his
one
of
those
actions
of
which
only
dmitri
fyodorovitch
would
be
capable
in
his
anger
and
in
his
passions
i
can
t
describe
it
even
i
can
t
find
my
words
i
ve
made
inquiries
about
his
victim
and
find
he
is
quite
a
poor
man
his
name
is
snegiryov
he
did
something
wrong
in
the
army
and
was
discharged
i
can
t
tell
you
what
and
now
he
has
sunk
into
terrible
destitution
with
his
family
an
unhappy
family
of
sick
children
and
i
believe
an
insane
wife
he
has
been
living
here
a
long
time
he
used
to
work
as
a
copying
clerk
but
now
he
is
getting
nothing
i
thought
if
you
that
is
i
thought
i
don
t
know
i
am
so
confused
you
see
i
wanted
to
ask
you
my
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
to
go
to
him
to
find
some
excuse
to
go
to
them
i
mean
to
that
captain
oh
goodness
how
badly
i
explain
it
and
delicately
carefully
as
only
you
know
how
to
alyosha
blushed
manage
to
give
him
this
assistance
these
two
hundred
roubles
he
will
be
sure
to
take
it
i
mean
persuade
him
to
take
it
or
rather
what
do
i
mean
you
see
it
s
not
by
way
of
compensation
to
prevent
him
from
taking
proceedings
for
i
believe
he
meant
to
but
simply
a
token
of
sympathy
of
a
desire
to
assist
him
from
me
dmitri
fyodorovitch
s
betrothed
not
from
himself
but
you
know
i
would
go
myself
but
you
ll
know
how
to
do
it
ever
so
much
better
he
lives
in
lake
street
in
the
house
of
a
woman
called
kalmikov
for
god
s
sake
alexey
fyodorovitch
do
it
for
me
and
now
now
i
am
rather
tired
good
by
she
turned
and
disappeared
behind
the
porti
re
so
quickly
that
alyosha
had
not
time
to
utter
a
word
though
he
wanted
to
speak
he
longed
to
beg
her
pardon
to
blame
himself
to
say
something
for
his
heart
was
full
and
he
could
not
bear
to
go
out
of
the
room
without
it
but
madame
hohlakov
took
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
along
with
her
in
the
hall
she
stopped
him
again
as
before
she
is
proud
she
is
struggling
with
herself
but
kind
charming
generous
she
exclaimed
in
a
half
whisper
oh
how
i
love
her
especially
sometimes
and
how
glad
i
am
again
of
everything
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
didn
t
know
but
i
must
tell
you
that
we
all
all
both
her
aunts
i
and
all
of
us
lise
even
have
been
hoping
and
praying
for
nothing
for
the
last
month
but
that
she
may
give
up
your
favorite
dmitri
who
takes
no
notice
of
her
and
does
not
care
for
her
and
may
marry
ivan
fyodorovitch
such
an
excellent
and
cultivated
young
man
who
loves
her
more
than
anything
in
the
world
we
are
in
a
regular
plot
to
bring
it
about
and
i
am
even
staying
on
here
perhaps
on
that
account
but
she
has
been
crying
she
has
been
wounded
again
cried
alyosha
never
trust
a
woman
s
tears
alexey
fyodorovitch

such
cases
i
am
always

s
little
voice
cried
from
behind
the
door
no
it
was
all
my
fault
i
am
horribly
to
blame
alyosha
repeated
unconsoled
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
in
an
agony
of
remorse
for
his
indiscretion
quite
the
contrary
you
behaved
like
an
angel
like
an
angel
i
am
ready
to
say
so
a
thousand
times
over
mamma

behaved
like
an
angel
lise
s
voice

heard
again
i
somehow

had
not

lise
that
she
loved

and
so
i
said

fyodorovitch

excellent
thing
that

hysterical
that
s
just
as
it
ought
to
be
in

delighted
did
you
notice
alexey
fyodorovitch
how
young
how
young
ivan
fyodorovitch
was
just
now
when
he
went
out
when
he
said
all
that
and
went
out
i
thought
he
was
so
learned
such
a
savant
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
behaved
so
warmly
openly
and
youthfully
with
such
youthful
inexperience
and
it
was
all
so
fine
like
you
and
the
way
he
repeated
that
german
verse
it
was
just
like
you
but
i
must
fly
i
must
fly
alexey
fyodorovitch
make
haste
to
carry
out
her
commission
and
then
make
haste
back
lise
do
you
want
anything
now
for
mercy
s
sake
don
t
keep
alexey
fyodorovitch
a
minute
he
will
come
back
to
you
at
once
madame
hohlakov
at
last
ran
off
before
leaving
alyosha
would
have
opened
the
door
to
see
lise
on
no
account
cried
lise
on
no
account
now
speak
through
the
door
how
have
you
come
to
be
an
angel
that
s
the
only
thing
i
want
to
know
for
an
awful
piece
of
stupidity
lise
good
by
don
t
dare
to
go
away
like
that
lise
was
beginning
lise
i
have
a
real
sorrow
i
ll
be
back
directly
but
i
have
a
great
great
sorrow
and
he
ran
out
of
the
room
chapter
vi
a
laceration
in
the
cottage
he
certainly
was
really
grieved
in
a
way
he
had
seldom
been
before
he
had
rushed
in
like
a
fool
and
meddled
in
what
in
a
love
affair
but
what
do
i
know
about
it
what
can
i
tell
about
such
things
he
repeated
to
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
flushing
crimson
oh
being
ashamed
would
be
nothing
shame
is
only
the
punishment
i
deserve
the
trouble
is
i
shall
certainly
have
caused
more
unhappiness
and
father
zossima
sent
me
to
reconcile
and
bring
them
together
is
this
the
way
to
bring
them
together
then
he
suddenly
remembered
how
he
had
tried
to
join
their
hands
and
he
felt
fearfully
ashamed
again
though
i
acted
quite
sincerely
i
must
be
more
sensible
in
the
future
he
concluded
suddenly
and
did
not
even
smile
at
his
conclusion
katerina
ivanovna
s
commission
took
him
to
lake
street
and
his
brother
dmitri
lived
close
by
in
a
turning
out
of
lake
street
alyosha
decided
to
go
to
him
in
any
case
before
going
to
the
captain
though
he
had
a
presentiment
that
he
would
not
find
his
brother
he
suspected
that
he
would
intentionally
keep
out
of
his
way
now
but
he
must
find
him
anyhow
time
was
passing
the
thought
of
his
dying
elder
had
not
left
alyosha
for
one
minute
from
the
time
he
set
off
from
the
monastery
there
was
one
point
which
interested
him
particularly
about
katerina
ivanovna
s
commission
when
she
had
mentioned
the
captain
s
son
the
little
schoolboy
who
had
run
beside
his
father
crying
the
idea
had
at
once
struck
alyosha
that
this
must
be
the
schoolboy
who
had
bitten
his
finger
when
he
alyosha
asked
him
what
he
had
done
to
hurt
him
now
alyosha
felt
practically
certain
of
this
though
he
could
not
have
said
why
thinking
of
another
subject
was
a
relief
and
he
resolved
to
think
no
more
about
the
mischief
he
had
done
and
not
to
torture
himself
with
remorse
but
to
do
what
he
had
to
do
let
come
what
would
at
that
thought
he
was
completely
comforted
turning
to
the
street
where
dmitri
lodged
he
felt
hungry
and
taking
out
of
his
pocket
the
roll
he
had
brought
from
his
father
s
he
ate
it
it
made
him
feel
stronger
dmitri
was
not
at
home
the
people
of
the
house
an
old
cabinet
maker
his
son
and
his
old
wife
looked
with
positive
suspicion
at
alyosha
he
hasn
t
slept
here
for
the
last
three
nights
maybe
he
has
gone
away
the
old
man
said
in
answer
to
alyosha
s
persistent
inquiries
alyosha
saw
that
he
was
answering
in
accordance
with
instructions
when
he
asked
whether
he
were
not
at
grushenka
s
or
in
hiding
at
foma
s
alyosha
spoke
so
freely
on
purpose
all
three
looked
at
him
in
alarm
they
are
fond
of
him
they
are
doing
their
best
for
him
thought
alyosha
that
s
good
at
last
he
found
the
house
in
lake
street
it
was
a
decrepit
little
house
sunk
on
one
side
with
three
windows
looking
into
the
street
and
with
a
muddy
yard
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
a
solitary
cow
he
crossed
the
yard
and
found
the
door
opening
into
the
passage
on
the
left
of
the
passage
lived
the
old
woman
of
the
house
with
her
old
daughter
both
seemed
to
be
deaf
in
answer
to
his
repeated
inquiry
for
the
captain
one
of
them
at
last
understood
that
he
was
asking
for
their
lodgers
and
pointed
to
a
door
across
the
passage
the
captain
s
lodging
turned
out
to
be
a
simple
cottage
room
alyosha
had
his
hand
on
the
iron
latch
to
open
the
door
when
he
was
struck
by
the
strange
hush
within
yet
he
knew
from
katerina
ivanovna
s
words
that
the
man
had
a
family
either
they
are
all
asleep
or
perhaps
they
have
heard
me
coming
and
are
waiting
for
me
to
open
the
door
i
d
better
knock
first
and
he
knocked
an
answer
came
but
not
at
once
after
an
interval
of
perhaps
ten
seconds
who
s
there
shouted
some
one
in
a
loud
and
very
angry
voice
then
alyosha
opened
the
door
and
crossed
the
threshold
he
found
himself
in
a
regular
peasant
s
room
though
it
was
large
it
was
cumbered
up
with
domestic
belongings
of
all
sorts
and
there
were
several
people
in
it
on
the
left
was
a
large
russian
stove
from
the
stove
to
the
window
on
the
left
was
a
string
running
across
the
room
and
on
it
there
were
rags
hanging
there
was
a
bedstead
against
the
wall
on
each
side
right
and
left
covered
with
knitted
quilts
on
the
one
on
the
left
was
a
pyramid
of
four
print
covered
pillows
each
smaller
than
the
one
beneath
on
the
other
there
was
only
one
very
small
pillow
the
opposite
corner
was
screened
off
by
a
curtain
or
a
sheet
hung
on
a
string
behind
this
curtain
could
be
seen
a
bed
made
up
on
a
bench
and
a
chair
the
rough
square
table
of
plain
wood
had
been
moved
into
the
middle
window
the
three
windows
which
consisted
each
of
four
tiny
greenish
mildewy
panes
gave
little
light
and
were
close
shut
so
that
the
room
was
not
very
light
and
rather
stuffy
on
the
table
was
a
frying
pan
with
the
remains
of
some
fried
eggs
a
half
eaten
piece
of
bread
and
a
small
bottle
with
a
few
drops
of
vodka
a
woman
of
genteel
appearance
wearing
a
cotton
gown
was
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
on
the
left
her
face
was
thin
and
yellow
and
her
sunken
cheeks
betrayed
at
the
first
glance
that
she
was
ill
but
what
struck
alyosha
most
was
the
expression
in
the
poor
woman
s
eyes
a
look
of
surprised
inquiry
and
yet
of
haughty
pride
and
while
he
was
talking
to
her
husband
her
big
brown
eyes
moved
from
one
speaker
to
the
other
with
the
same
haughty
and
questioning
expression
beside
her
at
the
window
stood
a
young
girl
rather
plain
with
scanty
reddish
hair
poorly
but
very
neatly
dressed
she
looked
disdainfully
at
alyosha
as
he
came
in
beside
the
other
bed
was
sitting
another
female
figure
she
was
a
very
sad
sight
a
young
girl
of
about
twenty
but
hunchback
and
crippled
with
withered
legs
as
alyosha
was
told
afterwards
her
crutches
stood
in
the
corner
close
by
the
strikingly
beautiful
and
gentle
eyes
of
this
poor
girl
looked
with
mild
serenity
at
alyosha
a
man
of
forty
five
was
sitting
at
the
table
finishing
the
fried
eggs
he
was
spare
small
and
weakly
built
he
had
reddish
hair
and
a
scanty
light
colored
beard
very
much
like
a
wisp
of
tow
this
comparison
and
the
phrase
a
wisp
of
tow
flashed
at
once
into
alyosha
s
mind
for
some
reason
he
remembered
it
afterwards
it
was
obviously
this
gentleman
who
had
shouted
to
him
as
there
was
no
other
man
in
the
room
but
when
alyosha
went
in
he
leapt
up
from
the
bench
on
which
he
was
sitting
and
hastily
wiping
his
mouth
with
a
ragged
napkin
darted
up
to
alyosha
it
s
a
monk
come
to
beg
for
the
monastery
a
nice
place
to
come
to
the
girl
standing
in
the
left
corner
said
aloud
the
man
spun
round
instantly
towards
her
and
answered
her
in
an
excited
and
breaking
voice
no
varvara
you
are
wrong
allow
me
to
ask
he
turned
again
to
alyosha
what
has
brought
you
to
our
retreat
alyosha
looked
attentively
at
him
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
him
there
was
something
angular
flurried
and
irritable
about
him
though
he
had
obviously
just
been
drinking
he
was
not
drunk
there
was
extraordinary
impudence
in
his
expression
and
yet
strange
to
say
at
the
same
time
there
was
fear
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
long
been
kept
in
subjection
and
had
submitted
to
it
and
now
had
suddenly
turned
and
was
trying
to
assert
himself
or
better
still
like
a
man
who
wants
dreadfully
to
hit
you
but
is
horribly
afraid
you
will
hit
him
in
his
words
and
in
the
intonation
of
his
shrill
voice
there
was
a
sort
of
crazy
humor
at
times
spiteful
and
at
times
cringing
and
continually
shifting
from
one
tone
to
another
the
question
about
our
retreat
he
had
asked
as
it
were
quivering
all
over
rolling
his
eyes
and
skipping
up
so
close
to
alyosha
that
he
instinctively
drew
back
a
step
he
was
dressed
in
a
very
shabby
dark
cotton
coat
patched
and
spotted
he
wore
checked
trousers
of
an
extremely
light
color
long
out
of
fashion
and
of
very
thin
material
they
were
so
crumpled
and
so
short
that
he
looked
as
though
he
had
grown
out
of
them
like
a
boy
i
am
alexey
karamazov
alyosha
began
in
reply
i
quite
understand
that
sir
the
gentleman
snapped
out
at
once
to
assure
him
that
he
knew
who
he
was
already
i
am
captain
snegiryov
sir
but
i
am
still
desirous
to
know
precisely
what
has
led
you
oh
i
ve
come
for
nothing
special
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
you
if
only
you
allow
me
in
that
case
here
is
a
chair
sir
kindly
be
seated
that
s
what
they
used
to
say
in
the
old
comedies
kindly
be
seated
and
with
a
rapid
gesture
he
seized
an
empty
chair
it
was
a
rough
wooden
chair
not
upholstered
and
set
it
for
him
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
room
then
taking
another
similar
chair
for
himself
he
sat
down
facing
alyosha
so
close
to
him
that
their
knees
almost
touched
nikolay
ilyitch
snegiryov
sir
formerly
a
captain
in
the
russian
infantry
put
to
shame
for
his
vices
but
still
a
captain
though
i
might
not
be
one
now
for
the
way
i
talk
for
the
last
half
of
my
life
i
ve
learnt
to
say
sir
it
s
a
word
you
use
when
you
ve
come
down
in
the
world
that
s
very
true
smiled
alyosha
but
is
it
used
involuntarily
or
on
purpose
as
god
s
above
it
s
involuntary
and
i
usen
t
to
use
it
i
didn
t
use
the
word
sir
all
my
life
but
as
soon
as
i
sank
into
low
water
i
began
to
say
sir
it
s
the
work
of
a
higher
power
i
see
you
are
interested
in
contemporary
questions
but
how
can
i
have
excited
your
curiosity
living
as
i
do
in
surroundings
impossible
for
the
exercise
of
hospitality
i
ve
come
about
that
business
about
what
business
the
captain
interrupted
impatiently
about
your
meeting
with
my
brother
dmitri
fyodorovitch
alyosha
blurted
out
awkwardly
what
meeting
sir
you
don
t
mean
that
meeting
about
my
wisp
of
tow
then
he
moved
closer
so
that
his
knees
positively
knocked
against
alyosha
his
lips
were
strangely
compressed
like
a
thread
what
wisp
of
tow
muttered
alyosha
he
is
come
to
complain
of
me
father
cried
a
voice
familiar
to
alyosha
the
voice
of
the
schoolboy
from
behind
the
curtain
i
bit
his
finger
just
now
the
curtain
was
pulled
and
alyosha
saw
his
assailant
lying
on
a
little
bed
made
up
on
the
bench
and
the
chair
in
the
corner
under
the
ikons
the
boy
lay
covered
by
his
coat
and
an
old
wadded
quilt
he
was
evidently
unwell
and
judging
by
his
glittering
eyes
he
was
in
a
fever
he
looked
at
alyosha
without
fear
as
though
he
felt
he
was
at
home
and
could
not
be
touched
what
did
he
bite
your
finger
the
captain
jumped
up
from
his
chair
was
it
your
finger
he
bit
yes
he
was
throwing
stones
with
other
schoolboys
there
were
six
of
them
against
him
alone
i
went
up
to
him
and
he
threw
a
stone
at
me
and
then
another
at
my
head
i
asked
him
what
i
had
done
to
him
and
then
he
rushed
at
me
and
bit
my
finger
badly
i
don
t
know
why
i
ll
thrash
him
sir
at
once
this
minute
the
captain
jumped
up
from
his
seat
but
i
am
not
complaining
at
all
i
am
simply
telling
you
i
don
t
want
him
to
be
thrashed
besides
he
seems
to
be
ill
and
do
you
suppose
i
d
thrash
him
that
i
d
take
my
ilusha
and
thrash
him
before
you
for
your
satisfaction
would
you
like
it
done
at
once
sir
said
the
captain
suddenly
turning
to
alyosha
as
though
he
were
going
to
attack
him
i
am
sorry
about
your
finger
sir
but
instead
of
thrashing
ilusha
would
you
like
me
to
chop
off
my
four
fingers
with
this
knife
here
before
your
eyes
to
satisfy
your
just
wrath
i
should
think
four
fingers
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
your
thirst
for
vengeance
you
won
t
ask
for
the
fifth
one
too
he
stopped
short
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
every
feature
in
his
face
was
twitching
and
working
he
looked
extremely
defiant
he
was
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
i
think
i
understand
it
all
now
said
alyosha
gently
and
sorrowfully
still
keeping
his
seat
so
your
boy
is
a
good
boy
he
loves
his
father
and
he
attacked
me
as
the
brother
of
your
assailant
now
i
understand
it
he
repeated
thoughtfully
but
my
brother
dmitri
fyodorovitch
regrets
his
action
i
know
that
and
if
only
it
is
possible
for
him
to
come
to
you
or
better
still
to
meet
you
in
that
same
place
he
will
ask
your
forgiveness
before
every
one
if
you
wish
it
after
pulling
out
my
beard
you
mean
he
will
ask
my
forgiveness
and
he
thinks
that
will
be
a
satisfactory
finish
doesn
t
he
oh
no
on
the
contrary
he
will
do
anything
you
like
and
in
any
way
you
like
so
if
i
were
to
ask
his
highness
to
go
down
on
his
knees
before
me
in
that
very
tavern
the
metropolis
it
s
called
or
in
the
market
place
he
would
do
it
yes
he
would
even
go
down
on
his
knees
you
ve
pierced
me
to
the
heart
sir
touched
me
to
tears
and
pierced
me
to
the
heart
i
am
only
too
sensible
of
your
brother
s
generosity
allow
me
to
introduce
my
family
my
two
daughters
and
my
son
my
litter
if
i
die
who
will
care
for
them
and
while
i
live
who
but
they
will
care
for
a
wretch
like
me
that
s
a
great
thing
the
lord
has
ordained
for
every
man
of
my
sort
sir
for
there
must
be
some
one
able
to
love
even
a
man
like
me
ah
that
s
perfectly
true
exclaimed
alyosha
oh
do
leave
off
playing
the
fool
some
idiot
comes
in
and
you
put
us
to
shame
cried
the
girl
by
the
window
suddenly
turning
to
her
father
with
a
disdainful
and
contemptuous
air
wait
a
little
varvara
cried
her
father
speaking
peremptorily
but
looking
at
her
quite
approvingly
that
s
her
character
he
said
addressing
alyosha
again
and
in
all
nature
there
was
naught
that
could
find
favor
in
his
eyes
or
rather
in
the
feminine
that
could
find
favor
in
her
eyes
but
now
let
me
present
you
to
my
wife
arina
petrovna
she
is
crippled
she
is
forty
three
she
can
move
but
very
little
she
is
of
humble
origin
arina
petrovna
compose
your
countenance
this
is
alexey
fyodorovitch
karamazov
get
up
alexey
fyodorovitch
he
took
him
by
the
hand
and
with
unexpected
force
pulled
him
up
you
must
stand
up
to
be
introduced
to
a
lady
it
s
not
the
karamazov
mamma
who
h
m
etcetera
but
his
brother
radiant
with
modest
virtues
come
arina
petrovna
come
mamma
first
your
hand
to
be
kissed
and
he
kissed
his
wife
s
hand
respectfully
and
even
tenderly
the
girl
at
the
window
turned
her
back
indignantly
on
the
scene
an
expression
of
extraordinary
cordiality
came
over
the
haughtily
inquiring
face
of
the
woman
good
morning
sit
down
mr
tchernomazov
she
said
karamazov
mamma
karamazov
we
are
of
humble
origin
he
whispered
again
well
karamazov
or
whatever
it
is
but
i
always
think
of
tchernomazov
sit
down
why
has
he
pulled
you
up
he
calls
me
crippled
but
i
am
not
only
my
legs
are
swollen
like
barrels
and
i
am
shriveled
up
myself
once
i
used
to
be
so
fat
but
now
it
s
as
though
i
had
swallowed
a
needle
we
are
of
humble
origin
the
captain
muttered
again
oh
father
father
the
hunchback
girl
who
had
till
then
been
silent
on
her
chair
said
suddenly
and
she
hid
her
eyes
in
her
handkerchief
buffoon
blurted
out
the
girl
at
the
window
have
you
heard
our
news
said
the
mother
pointing
at
her
daughters
it
s
like
clouds
coming
over
the
clouds
pass
and
we
have
music
again
when
we
were
with
the
army
we
used
to
have
many
such
guests
i
don
t
mean
to
make
any
comparisons
every
one
to
their
taste
the
deacon
s
wife
used
to
come
then
and
say
alexandr
alexandrovitch
is
a
man
of
the
noblest
heart
but
nastasya
petrovna
she
would
say
is
of
the
brood
of
hell
well
i
said
that
s
a
matter
of
taste
but
you
are
a
little
spitfire
and
you
want
keeping
in
your
place
says
she
you
black
sword
said
i
who
asked
you
to
teach
me
but
my
breath
says
she
is
clean
and
yours
is
unclean
you
ask
all
the
officers
whether
my
breath
is
unclean
and
ever
since
then
i
had
it
in
my
mind
not
long
ago
i
was
sitting
here
as
i
am
now
when
i
saw
that
very
general

here
for
easter
and
i
asked
him
your
excellency
said
i
can

lady

yes
he
answered
you
ought
to
open
a
window
pane
or
open
the
door
for
the
air

not
fresh
here
and
they
all
go
on
like
that
and
what

breath

dead

the
air

poor
lonely
creature

my
breath

unpleasant
to

and
the
poor
mad
woman
broke
into
sobs
and
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
the
captain
rushed
up
to
her
mamma
mamma
my
dear
give
over

every
one

one

he
began
kissing
both
her
hands
again
and
tenderly
stroking
her
face
taking
the
dinner
napkin
he
began
wiping
away
her
tears
alyosha
fancied
that
he
too
had
tears
in
his
eyes
there
you
see
you
hear
he
turned
with
a
sort
of
fury
to
alyosha
pointing
to
the
poor
imbecile
i
see
and

muttered
alyosha
father
father

the
boy
sitting
up
in
his
bed
and
gazing
at
his
father

glowing
eyes

over
fooling

silly
antics

is
my
daughter
nina
i
forgot
to
introduce
her
to
you
she
is
a
heavenly
angel
incarnate
who
has
flown
down
to
us
mortals
if
you
can
understand
there
he
is
shaking
all
over
as
though
he
is
in
convulsions
varvara
went
on
indignantly
and
she
there
stamping
her
foot
at
me
and
calling
me
a
fool
just
now
she
is
a
heavenly
angel
incarnate
too
and
she
has
good
reason
to
call
me
so
come
along
alexey
fyodorovitch
we
must
make
an
end
and
snatching
alyosha
s
hand
he
drew
him
out
of
the
room
into
the
street
chapter
vii
and
in
the
open
air
the
air
is
fresh
but
in
my
apartment
it
is
not
so
in
any
sense
of
the
word
let
us
walk
slowly
sir
i
should
be
glad
of
your
kind
interest
i
too
have
something
important
to
say
to
you
observed
alyosha
only
i
don
t
know
how
to
begin
to
be
sure
you
must
have
business
with
me
you
would
never
have
looked
in
upon
me
without
some
object
unless
you
come
simply
to
complain
of
the
boy
and
that
s
hardly
likely
and
by
the
way
about
the
boy
i
could
not
explain
to
you
in
there
but
here
i
will
describe
that
scene
to
you
my
tow
was
thicker
a
week
ago
i
mean
my
beard
that
s
the
nickname
they
give
to
my
beard
the
schoolboys
most
of
all
well
your
brother
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
pulling
me
by
my
beard
i
d
done
nothing
he
was
in
a
towering
rage
and
happened
to
come
upon
me
he
dragged
me
out
of
the
tavern
into
the
market
place
at
that
moment
the
boys
were
coming
out
of
school
and
with
them
ilusha
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
in
such
a
state
he
rushed
up
to
me
father
he
cried
father
he
caught
hold
of
me
hugged
me
tried
to
pull
me
away
crying
to
my
assailant
let
go
let
go
it
s
my
father
forgive
him
yes
he
actually
cried
forgive
him
he
clutched
at
that
hand
that
very
hand
in
his
little
hands
and
kissed
it
i
remember
his
little
face
at
that
moment
i
haven
t
forgotten
it
and
i
never
shall
i
swear
cried
alyosha
that
my
brother
will
express
his
most
deep
and
sincere
regret
even
if
he
has
to
go
down
on
his
knees
in
that
same
market
place
i
ll
make
him
or
he
is
no
brother
of
mine
aha
then
it
s
only
a
suggestion
and
it
does
not
come
from
him
but
simply
from
the
generosity
of
your
own
warm
heart
you
should
have
said
so
no
in
that
case
allow
me
to
tell
you
of
your
brother
s
highly
chivalrous
soldierly
generosity
for
he
did
give
expression
to
it
at
the
time
he
left
off
dragging
me
by
my
beard
and
released
me
you
are
an
officer
he
said
and
i
am
an
officer
if
you
can
find
a
decent
man
to
be
your
second
send
me
your
challenge
i
will
give
satisfaction
though
you
are
a
scoundrel
that
s
what
he
said
a
chivalrous
spirit
indeed
i
retired
with
ilusha
and
that
scene
is
a
family
record
imprinted
for
ever
on
ilusha
s
soul
no
it
s
not
for
us
to
claim
the
privileges
of
noblemen
judge
for
yourself
you
ve
just
been
in
our
mansion
what
did
you
see
there
three
ladies
one
a
cripple
and
weak
minded
another
a
cripple
and
hunchback
and
the
third
not
crippled
but
far
too
clever
she
is
a
student
dying
to
get
back
to
petersburg
to
work
for
the
emancipation
of
the
russian
woman
on
the
banks
of
the
neva
i
won
t
speak
of
ilusha
he
is
only
nine
i
am
alone
in
the
world
and
if
i
die
what
will
become
of
all
of
them
i
simply
ask
you
that
and
if
i
challenge
him
and
he
kills
me
on
the
spot
what
then
what
will
become
of
them
and
worse
still
if
he
doesn
t
kill
me
but
only
cripples
me
i
couldn
t
work
but
i
should
still
be
a
mouth
to
feed
who
would
feed
it
and
who
would
feed
them
all
must
i
take
ilusha
from
school
and
send
him
to
beg
in
the
streets
that
s
what
it
means
for
me
to
challenge
him
to
a
duel
it
s
silly
talk
and
nothing
else
he
will
beg
your
forgiveness
he
will
bow
down
at
your
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
market
place
cried
alyosha
again
with
glowing
eyes
i
did
think
of
prosecuting
him
the
captain
went
on
but
look
in
our
code
could
i
get
much
compensation
for
a
personal
injury
and
then
agrafena
alexandrovna
3
sent
for
me
and
shouted
at
me
don
t
dare
to
dream
of
it
if
you
proceed
against
him
i
ll
publish
it
to
all
the
world
that
he
beat
you
for
your
dishonesty
and
then
you
will
be
prosecuted
i
call
god
to
witness
whose
was
the
dishonesty
and
by
whose
commands
i
acted
wasn
t
it
by
her
own
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
and
what
s
more
she
went
on
i
ll
dismiss
you
for
good
and
you
ll
never
earn
another
penny
from
me
i
ll
speak
to
my
merchant
too
that
s
what
she
calls
her
old
man
and
he
will
dismiss
you
and
if
he
dismisses
me
what
can
i
earn
then
from
any
one
those
two
are
all
i
have
to
look
to
for
your
fyodor
pavlovitch
has
not
only
given
over
employing
me
for
another
reason
but
he
means
to
make
use
of
papers
i
ve
signed
to
go
to
law
against
me
and
so
i
kept
quiet
and
you
have
seen
our
retreat
but
now
let
me
ask
you
did
ilusha
hurt
your
finger
much
i
didn
t
like
to
go
into
it
in
our
mansion
before
him
yes
very
much
and
he
was
in
a
great
fury
he
was
avenging
you
on
me
as
a
karamazov
i
see
that
now
but
if
only
you
had
seen
how
he
was
throwing
stones
at
his
school
fellows
it
s
very
dangerous
they
might
kill
him
they
are
children
and
stupid
a
stone
may
be
thrown
and
break
somebody
s
head
that
s
just
what
has
happened
he
has
been
bruised
by
a
stone
to
day
not
on
the
head
but
on
the
chest
just
above
the
heart
he
came
home
crying
and
groaning
and
now
he
is
ill
and
you
know
he
attacks
them
first
he
is
bitter
against
them
on
your
account
they
say
he
stabbed
a
boy
called
krassotkin
with
a
pen
knife
not
long
ago
i
ve
heard
about
that
too
it
s
dangerous
krassotkin
is
an
official
here
we
may
hear
more
about
it
i
would
advise
you
alyosha
went
on
warmly
not
to
send
him
to
school
at
all
for
a
time
till
he
is
calmer
and
his
anger
is
passed
anger
the
captain
repeated
that
s
just
what
it
is
he
is
a
little
creature
but
it
s
a
mighty
anger
you
don
t
know
all
sir
let
me
tell
you
more
since
that
incident
all
the
boys
have
been
teasing
him
about
the
wisp
of
tow
schoolboys
are
a
merciless
race
individually
they
are
angels
but
together
especially
in
schools
they
are
often
merciless
their
teasing
has
stirred
up
a
gallant
spirit
in
ilusha
an
ordinary
boy
a
weak
son
would
have
submitted
have
felt
ashamed
of
his
father
sir
but
he
stood
up
for
his
father
against
them
all
for
his
father
and
for
truth
and
justice
for
what
he
suffered
when
he
kissed
your
brother
s
hand
and
cried
to
him
forgive
father
forgive
him
that
only
god
knows
and
i
his
father
for
our
children
not
your
children
but
ours
the
children
of
the
poor
gentlemen
looked
down
upon
by
every
one
know
what
justice
means
sir
even
at
nine
years
old
how
should
the
rich
know
they
don
t
explore
such
depths
once
in
their
lives
but
at
that
moment
in
the
square
when
he
kissed
his
hand
at
that
moment
my
ilusha
had
grasped
all
that
justice
means
that
truth
entered
into
him
and
crushed
him
for
ever
sir
the
captain
said
hotly
again
with
a
sort
of
frenzy
and
he
struck
his
right
fist
against
his
left
palm
as
though
he
wanted
to
show
how
the
truth
crushed
ilusha
that
very
day
sir
he
fell
ill
with
fever
and
was
delirious
all
night
all
that
day
he
hardly
said
a
word
to
me
but
i
noticed
he
kept
watching
me
from
the
corner
though
he
turned
to
the
window
and
pretended
to
be
learning
his
lessons
but
i
could
see
his
mind
was
not
on
his
lessons
next
day
i
got
drunk
to
forget
my
troubles
sinful
man
as
i
am
and
i
don
t
remember
much
mamma
began
crying
too
i
am
very
fond
of
mamma
well
i
spent
my
last
penny
drowning
my
troubles
don
t
despise
me
for
that
sir
in
russia
men
who
drink
are
the
best
the
best
men
amongst
us
are
the
greatest
drunkards
i
lay
down
and
i
don
t
remember
about
ilusha
though
all
that
day
the
boys
had
been
jeering
at
him
at
school
wisp
of
tow
they
shouted
your
father
was
pulled
out
of
the
tavern
by
his
wisp
of
tow
you
ran
by
and
begged
forgiveness
on
the
third
day
when
he
came
back
from
school
i
saw
he
looked
pale
and
wretched
what
is
it
i
asked
he
wouldn
t
answer
well
there
s
no
talking
in
our
mansion
without
mamma
and
the
girls
taking
part
in
it
what
s
more
the
girls
had
heard
about
it
the
very
first
day
varvara
had
begun
snarling
you
fools
and
buffoons
can
you
ever
do
anything
rational
quite
so
i
said
can
we
ever
do
anything
rational
for
the
time
i
turned
it
off
like
that
so
in
the
evening
i
took
the
boy
out
for
a
walk
for
you
must
know
we
go
for
a
walk
every
evening
always
the
same
way
along
which
we
are
going
now
from
our
gate
to
that
great
stone
which
lies
alone
in
the
road
under
the
hurdle
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
town
pasture
a
beautiful
and
lonely
spot
sir
ilusha
and
i
walked
along
hand
in
hand
as
usual
he
has
a
little
hand
his
fingers
are
thin
and
cold
he
suffers
with
his
chest
you
know
father
said
he
father
well
said
i
i
saw
his
eyes
flashing
father
how
he
treated
you
then
it
can
t
be
helped
ilusha
i
said
don
t
forgive
him
father
don
t
forgive
him
at
school
they
say
that
he
has
paid
you
ten
roubles
for
it
no
ilusha
said
i
i
would
not
take
money
from
him
for
anything
then
he
began
trembling
all
over
took
my
hand
in
both
his
and
kissed
it
again
father
he
said
father
challenge
him
to
a
duel
at
school
they
say
you
are
a
coward
and
won
t
challenge
him
and
that
you
ll
accept
ten
roubles
from
him
i
can
t
challenge
him
to
a
duel
ilusha
i
answered
and
i
told
briefly
what
i
ve
just
told
you
he
listened
father
he
said
anyway
don
t
forgive
it
when
i
grow
up
i
ll
call
him
out
myself
and
kill
him
his
eyes
shone
and
glowed
and
of
course
i
am
his
father
and
i
had
to
put
in
a
word
it
s
a
sin
to
kill
i
said
even
in
a
duel
father
he
said
when
i
grow
up
i
ll
knock
him
down
knock
the
sword
out
of
his
hand
i
ll
fall
on
him
wave
my
sword
over
him
and
say
i
could
kill
you
but
i
forgive
you
so
there
you
see
what
the
workings
of
his
little
mind
have
been
during
these
two
days
he
must
have
been
planning
that
vengeance
all
day
and
raving
about
it
at
night
but
he
began
to
come
home
from
school
badly
beaten
i
found
out
about
it
the
day
before
yesterday
and
you
are
right
i
won
t
send
him
to
that
school
any
more
i
heard
that
he
was
standing
up
against
all
the
class
alone
and
defying
them
all
that
his
heart
was
full
of
resentment
of
bitterness
i
was
alarmed
about
him
we
went
for
another
walk
father
he
asked
are
the
rich
people
stronger
than
any
one
else
on
earth
yes
ilusha
i
said
there
are
no
people
on
earth
stronger
than
the
rich
father
he
said
i
will
get
rich
i
will
become
an
officer
and
conquer
everybody
the
tsar
will
reward
me
i
will
come
back
here
and
then
no
one
will
dare
then
he
was
silent
and
his
lips
still
kept
trembling
father
he
said
what
a
horrid
town
this
is
yes
ilusha
i
said
it
isn
t
a
very
nice
town
father
let
us
move
into
another
town
a
nice
one
he
said
where
people
don
t
know
about
us
we
will
move
we
will
ilusha
said
i
only
i
must
save
up
for
it
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
turn
his
mind
from
painful
thoughts
and
we
began
to
dream
of
how
we
would
move
to
another
town
how
we
would
buy
a
horse
and
cart
we
will
put
mamma
and
your
sisters
inside
we
will
cover
them
up
and
we
ll
walk
you
shall
have
a
lift
now
and
then
and
i
ll
walk
beside
for
we
must
take
care
of
our
horse
we
can
t
all
ride
that
s
how
we
ll
go
he
was
enchanted
at
that
most
of
all
at
the
thought
of
having
a
horse
and
driving
him
for
of
course
a
russian
boy
is
born
among
horses
we
chattered
a
long
while
thank
god
i
thought
i
have
diverted
his
mind
and
comforted
him
that
was
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
evening
but
last
night
everything
was
changed
he
had
gone
to
school
in
the
morning
he
came
back
depressed
terribly
depressed
in
the
evening
i
took
him
by
the
hand
and
we
went
for
a
walk
he
would
not
talk
there
was
a
wind
blowing
and
no
sun
and
a
feeling
of
autumn
twilight
was
coming
on
we
walked
along
both
of
us
depressed
well
my
boy
said
i
how
about
our
setting
off
on
our
travels
i
thought
i
might
bring
him
back
to
our
talk
of
the
day
before
he
didn
t
answer
but
i
felt
his
fingers
trembling
in
my
hand
ah
i
thought
it
s
a
bad
job
there
s
something
fresh
we
had
reached
the
stone
where
we
are
now
i
sat
down
on
the
stone
and
in
the
air
there
were
lots
of
kites
flapping
and
whirling
there
were
as
many
as
thirty
in
sight
of
course
it
s
just
the
season
for
the
kites
look
ilusha
said
i
it
s
time
we
got
out
our
last
year
s
kite
again
i
ll
mend
it
where
have
you
put
it
away
my
boy
made
no
answer
he
looked
away
and
turned
sideways
to
me
and
then
a
gust
of
wind
blew
up
the
sand
he
suddenly
fell
on
me
threw
both
his
little
arms
round
my
neck
and
held
me
tight
you
know
when
children
are
silent
and
proud
and
try
to
keep
back
their
tears
when
they
are
in
great
trouble
and
suddenly
break
down
their
tears
fall
in
streams
with
those
warm
streams
of
tears
he
suddenly
wetted
my
face
he
sobbed
and
shook
as
though
he
were
in
convulsions
and
squeezed
up
against
me
as
i
sat
on
the
stone
father
he
kept
crying
dear
father
how
he
insulted
you
and
i
sobbed
too
we
sat
shaking
in
each
other
s
arms
ilusha
i
said
to
him
ilusha
darling
no
one
saw
us
then
god
alone
saw
us
i
hope
he
will
record
it
to
my
credit
you
must
thank
your
brother
alexey
fyodorovitch
no
sir
i
won
t
thrash
my
boy
for
your
satisfaction
he
had
gone
back
to
his
original
tone
of
resentful
buffoonery
alyosha
felt
though
that
he
trusted
him
and
that
if
there
had
been
some
one
else
in
his
alyosha
s
place
the
man
would
not
have
spoken
so
openly
and
would
not
have
told
what
he
had
just
told
this
encouraged
alyosha
whose
heart
was
trembling
on
the
verge
of
tears
ah
how
i
would
like
to
make
friends
with
your
boy
he
cried
if
you
could
arrange
it
certainly
sir
muttered
the
captain
but
now
listen
to
something
quite
different
alyosha
went
on
i
have
a
message
for
you
that
same
brother
of
mine
dmitri
has
insulted
his
betrothed
too
a
noble
hearted
girl
of
whom
you
have
probably
heard
i
have
a
right
to
tell
you
of
her
wrong
i
ought
to
do
so
in
fact
for
hearing
of
the
insult
done
to
you
and
learning
all
about
your
unfortunate
position
she
commissioned
me
at
once
just
now
to
bring
you
this
help
from
her
but
only
from
her
alone
not
from
dmitri
who
has
abandoned
her
nor
from
me
his
brother
nor
from
any
one
else
but
from
her
only
from
her
she
entreats
you
to
accept
her
help
you
have
both
been
insulted
by
the
same
man
she
thought
of
you
only
when
she
had
just
received
a
similar
insult
from
him
similar
in
its
cruelty
i
mean
she
comes
like
a
sister
to
help
a
brother
in
misfortune
she
told
me
to
persuade
you
to
take
these
two
hundred
roubles
from
her
as
from
a
sister
knowing
that
you
are
in
such
need
no
one
will
know
of
it
it
can
give
rise
to
no
unjust
slander
there
are
the
two
hundred
roubles
and
i
swear
you
must
take
them
unless
unless
all
men
are
to
be
enemies
on
earth
but
there
are
brothers
even
on
earth
you
have
a
generous
heart
you
must
see
that
you
must
and
alyosha
held
out
two
new
rainbow
colored
hundred
rouble
notes
they
were
both
standing
at
the
time
by
the
great
stone
close
to
the
fence
and
there
was
no
one
near
the
notes
seemed
to
produce
a
tremendous
impression
on
the
captain
he
started
but
at
first
only
from
astonishment
such
an
outcome
of
their
conversation
was
the
last
thing
he
expected
nothing
could
have
been
farther
from
his
dreams
than
help
from
any
one
and
such
a
sum
he
took
the
notes
and
for
a
minute
he
was
almost
unable
to
answer
quite
a
new
expression
came
into
his
face
that
for
me
so
much
money
two
hundred
roubles
good
heavens
why
i
haven
t
seen
so
much
money
for
the
last
four
years
mercy
on
us
and
she
says
she
is
a
sister
and
is
that
the
truth
i
swear
that
all
i
told
you
is
the
truth
cried
alyosha
the
captain
flushed
red
listen
my
dear
listen
if
i
take
it
i
shan
t
be
behaving
like
a
scoundrel
in
your
eyes
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
shan
t
be
a
scoundrel
no
alexey
fyodorovitch
listen
listen
he
hurried
touching
alyosha
with
both
his
hands
you
are
persuading
me
to
take
it
saying
that
it
s
a
sister
sends
it
but
inwardly
in
your
heart
won
t
you
feel
contempt
for
me
if
i
take
it
eh
no
no
on
my
salvation
i
swear
i
shan
t
and
no
one
will
ever
know
but
me
i
you
and
she
and
one
other
lady
her
great
friend
never
mind
the
lady
listen
alexey
fyodorovitch
at
a
moment
like
this
you
must
listen
for
you
can
t
understand
what
these
two
hundred
roubles
mean
to
me
now
the
poor
fellow
went
on
rising
gradually
into
a
sort
of
incoherent
almost
wild
enthusiasm
he
was
thrown
off
his
balance
and
talked
extremely
fast
as
though
afraid
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
say
all
he
had
to
say
besides
its
being
honestly
acquired
from
a
sister
so
highly
respected
and
revered
do
you
know
that
now
i
can
look
after
mamma
and
nina
my
hunchback
angel
daughter
doctor
herzenstube
came
to
me
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
and
was
examining
them
both
for
a
whole
hour
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
said
he
but
he
prescribed
a
mineral
water
which
is
kept
at
a
chemist
s
here
he
said
it
would
be
sure
to
do
her
good
and
he
ordered
baths
too
with
some
medicine
in
them
the
mineral
water
costs
thirty
copecks
and
she
d
need
to
drink
forty
bottles
perhaps
so
i
took
the
prescription
and
laid
it
on
the
shelf
under
the
ikons
and
there
it
lies
and
he
ordered
hot
baths
for
nina
with
something
dissolved
in
them
morning
and
evening
but
how
can
we
carry
out
such
a
cure
in
our
mansion
without
servants
without
help
without
a
bath
and
without
water
nina
is
rheumatic
all
over
i
don
t
think
i
told
you
that
all
her
right
side
aches
at
night
she
is
in
agony
and
would
you
believe
it
the
angel
bears
it
without
groaning
for
fear
of
waking
us
we
eat
what
we
can
get
and
she
ll
only
take
the
leavings
what
you
d
scarcely
give
to
a
dog
i
am
not
worth
it
i
am
taking
it
from
you
i
am
a
burden
on
you
that
s
what
her
angel
eyes
try
to
express
we
wait
on
her
but
she
doesn
t
like
it
i
am
a
useless
cripple
no
good
to
any
one
as
though
she
were
not
worth
it
when
she
is
the
saving
of
all
of
us
with
her
angelic
sweetness
without
her
without
her
gentle
word
it
would
be
hell
among
us
she
softens
even
varvara
and
don
t
judge
varvara
harshly
either
she
is
an
angel
too
she
too
has
suffered
wrong
she
came
to
us
for
the
summer
and
she
brought
sixteen
roubles
she
had
earned
by
lessons
and
saved
up
to
go
back
with
to
petersburg
in
september
that
is
now
but
we
took
her
money
and
lived
on
it
so
now
she
has
nothing
to
go
back
with
though
indeed
she
couldn
t
go
back
for
she
has
to
work
for
us
like
a
slave
she
is
like
an
overdriven
horse
with
all
of
us
on
her
back
she
waits
on
us
all
mends
and
washes
sweeps
the
floor
puts
mamma
to
bed
and
mamma
is
capricious
and
tearful
and
insane
and
now
i
can
get
a
servant
with
this
money
you
understand
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
can
get
medicines
for
the
dear
creatures
i
can
send
my
student
to
petersburg
i
can
buy
beef
i
can
feed
them
properly
good
lord
but
it
s
a
dream
alyosha
was
delighted
that
he
had
brought
him
such
happiness
and
that
the
poor
fellow
had
consented
to
be
made
happy
stay
alexey
fyodorovitch
stay
the
captain
began
to
talk
with
frenzied
rapidity
carried
away
by
a
new
day
dream
do
you
know
that
ilusha
and
i
will
perhaps
really
carry
out
our
dream
we
will
buy
a
horse
and
cart
a
black
horse
he
insists
on
its
being
black
and
we
will
set
off
as
we
pretended
the
other
day
i
have
an
old
friend
a
lawyer
in
k
province
and
i
heard
through
a
trustworthy
man
that
if
i
were
to
go
he
d
give
me
a
place
as
clerk
in
his
office
so
who
knows
maybe
he
would
so
i
d
just
put
mamma
and
nina
in
the
cart
and
ilusha
could
drive
and
i
d
walk
i
d
walk
why
if
i
only
succeed
in
getting
one
debt
paid
that
s
owing
me
i
should
have
perhaps
enough
for
that
too
there
would
be
enough
cried
alyosha
katerina
ivanovna
will
send
you
as
much
more
as
you
need
and
you
know
i
have
money
too
take
what
you
want
as
you
would
from
a
brother
from
a
friend
you
can
give
it
back
later
you
ll
get
rich
you
ll
get
rich
and
you
know
you
couldn
t
have
a
better
idea
than
to
move
to
another
province
it
would
be
the
saving
of
you
especially
of
your
boy
and
you
ought
to
go
quickly
before
the
winter
before
the
cold
you
must
write
to
us
when
you
are
there
and
we
will
always
be
brothers
no
it
s
not
a
dream
alyosha
could
have
hugged
him
he
was
so
pleased
but
glancing
at
him
he
stopped
short
the
man
was
standing
with
his
neck
outstretched
and
his
lips
protruding
with
a
pale
and
frenzied
face
his
lips
were
moving
as
though
trying
to
articulate
something
no
sound
came
but
still
his
lips
moved
it
was
uncanny
what
is
it
asked
alyosha
startled
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
you
muttered
the
captain
faltering
looking
at
him
with
a
strange
wild
fixed
stare
and
an
air
of
desperate
resolution
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
sort
of
grin
on
his
lips
i
you
sir
wouldn
t
you
like
me
to
show
you
a
little
trick
i
know
he
murmured
suddenly
in
a
firm
rapid
whisper
his
voice
no
longer
faltering
what
trick
a
pretty
trick
whispered
the
captain
his
mouth
was
twisted
on
the
left
side
his
left
eye
was
screwed
up
he
still
stared
at
alyosha
what
is
the
matter
what
trick
alyosha
cried
now
thoroughly
alarmed
why
look
squealed
the
captain
suddenly
and
showing
him
the
two
notes
which
he
had
been
holding
by
one
corner
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
during
the
conversation
he
crumpled
them
up
savagely
and
squeezed
them
tight
in
his
right
hand
do
you
see
do
you
see
he
shrieked
pale
and
infuriated
and
suddenly
flinging
up
his
hand
he
threw
the
crumpled
notes
on
the
sand
do
you
see
he
shrieked
again
pointing
to
them
look
there
and
with
wild
fury
he
began
trampling
them
under
his
heel
gasping
and
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
so
much
for
your
money
so
much
for
your
money
so
much
for
your
money
so
much
for
your
money
suddenly
he
darted
back
and
drew
himself
up
before
alyosha
and
his
whole
figure
expressed
unutterable
pride
tell
those
who
sent
you
that
the
wisp
of
tow
does
not
sell
his
honor
he
cried
raising
his
arm
in
the
air
then
he
turned
quickly
and
began
to
run
but
he
had
not
run
five
steps
before
he
turned
completely
round
and
kissed
his
hand
to
alyosha
he
ran
another
five
paces
and
then
turned
round
for
the
last
time
this
time
his
face
was
not
contorted
with
laughter
but
quivering
all
over
with
tears
in
a
tearful
faltering
sobbing
voice
he
cried
what
should
i
say
to
my
boy
if
i
took
money
from
you
for
our
shame
and
then
he
ran
on
without
turning
alyosha
looked
after
him
inexpressibly
grieved
oh
he
saw
that
till
the
very
last
moment
the
man
had
not
known
he
would
crumple
up
and
fling
away
the
notes
he
did
not
turn
back
alyosha
knew
he
would
not
he
would
not
follow
him
and
call
him
back
he
knew
why
when
he
was
out
of
sight
alyosha
picked
up
the
two
notes
they
were
very
much
crushed
and
crumpled
and
had
been
pressed
into
the
sand
but
were
uninjured
and
even
rustled
like
new
ones
when
alyosha
unfolded
them
and
smoothed
them
out
after
smoothing
them
out
he
folded
them
up
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
went
to
katerina
ivanovna
to
report
on
the
success
of
her
commission
book
v
pro
and
contra
chapter
i
the
engagement
madame
hohlakov
was
again
the
first
to
meet
alyosha
she
was
flustered
something
important
had
happened
katerina
ivanovna
s
hysterics
had
ended
in
a
fainting
fit
and
then
a
terrible
awful
weakness
had
followed
she
lay
with
her
eyes
turned
up
and
was
delirious
now
she
was
in
a
fever
they
had
sent
for
herzenstube
they
had
sent
for
the
aunts
the
aunts
were
already
here
but
herzenstube
had
not
yet
come
they
were
all
sitting
in
her
room
waiting
she
was
unconscious
now
and
what
if
it
turned
to
brain
fever
madame
hohlakov
looked
gravely
alarmed
this
is
serious
serious
she
added
at
every
word
as
though
nothing
that
had
happened
to
her
before
had
been
serious
alyosha
listened
with
distress
and
was
beginning
to
describe
his
adventures
but
she
interrupted
him
at
the
first
words
she
had
not
time
to
listen
she
begged
him
to
sit
with
lise
and
wait
for
her
there
lise
she
whispered
almost
in
his
ear
lise
has
greatly
surprised
me
just
now
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
touched
me
too
and
so
my
heart
forgives
her
everything
only
fancy
as
soon
as
you
had
gone
she
began
to
be
truly
remorseful
for
having
laughed
at
you
to
day
and
yesterday
though
she
was
not
laughing
at
you
but
only
joking
but
she
was
seriously
sorry
for
it
almost
ready
to
cry
so
that
i
was
quite
surprised
she
has
never
been
really
sorry
for
laughing
at
me
but
has
only
made
a
joke
of
it
and
you
know
she
is
laughing
at
me
every
minute
but
this
time
she
was
in
earnest
she
thinks
a
great
deal
of
your
opinion
alexey
fyodorovitch
and
don
t
take
offense
or
be
wounded
by
her
if
you
can
help
it
i
am
never
hard
upon
her
for
she
s
such
a
clever
little
thing
would
you
believe
it
she
said
just
now
that
you
were
a
friend
of
her
childhood
the
greatest
friend
of
her
childhood
just
think
of
that
greatest
friend
and
what
about
me
she
has
very
strong
feelings
and
memories
and
what
s
more
she
uses
these
phrases
most
unexpected
words
which
come
out
all
of
a
sudden
when
you
least
expect
them
she
spoke
lately
about
a
pine
tree
for
instance
there
used
to
be
a
pine
tree
standing
in
our
garden
in
her
early
childhood
very
likely
it
s
standing
there
still
so
there
s
no
need
to
speak
in
the
past
tense
pine
trees
are
not
like
people
alexey
fyodorovitch
they
don
t
change
quickly
mamma
she
said
i
remember
this
pine
tree
as
in
a
dream
only
she
said
something
so
original
about
it
that
i
can
t
repeat
it
besides
i
ve
forgotten
it
well
good
by
i
am
so
worried
i
feel
i
shall
go
out
of
my
mind
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
ve
been
out
of
my
mind
twice
in
my
life
go
to
lise
cheer
her
up
as
you
always
can
so
charmingly
lise
she
cried
going
to
her
door
here
i
ve
brought
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
whom
you
insulted
so
he
is
not
at
all
angry
i
assure
you
on
the
contrary
he
is
surprised
that
you
could
suppose
so
merci
maman
come
in
alexey
fyodorovitch
alyosha
went
in
lise
looked
rather
embarrassed
and
at
once
flushed
crimson
she
was
evidently
ashamed
of
something
and
as
people
always
do
in
such
cases
she
began
immediately
talking
of
other
things
as
though
they
were
of
absorbing
interest
to
her
at
the
moment
mamma
has
just
told
me
all
about
the
two
hundred
roubles
alexey
fyodorovitch
and
your
taking
them
to
that
poor
officer
and
she
told
me
all
the
awful
story
of
how
he
had
been
insulted
and
you
know
although
mamma
muddles
things
she
always
rushes
from
one
thing
to
another
i
cried
when
i
heard
well
did
you
give
him
the
money
and
how
is
that
poor
man
getting
on
the
fact
is
i
didn
t
give
it
to
him
and
it
s
a
long
story
answered
alyosha
as
though
he
too
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
regret
at
having
failed
yet
lise
saw
perfectly
well
that
he
too
looked
away
and
that
he
too
was
trying
to
talk
of
other
things
alyosha
sat
down
to
the
table
and
began
to
tell
his
story
but
at
the
first
words
he
lost
his
embarrassment
and
gained
the
whole
of
lise
s
attention
as
well
he
spoke
with
deep
feeling
under
the
influence
of
the
strong
impression
he
had
just
received
and
he
succeeded
in
telling
his
story
well
and
circumstantially
in
old
days
in
moscow
he
had
been
fond
of
coming
to
lise
and
describing
to
her
what
had
just
happened
to
him
what
he
had
read
or
what
he
remembered
of
his
childhood
sometimes
they
had
made
day
dreams
and
woven
whole
romances
together
generally
cheerful
and
amusing
ones
now
they
both
felt
suddenly
transported
to
the
old
days
in
moscow
two
years
before
lise
was
extremely
touched
by
his
story
alyosha
described
ilusha
with
warm
feeling
when
he
finished
describing
how
the
luckless
man
trampled
on
the
money
lise
could
not
help
clasping
her
hands
and
crying
out
so
you
didn
t
give
him
the
money
so
you
let
him
run
away
oh
dear
you
ought
to
have
run
after
him
no
lise
it
s
better
i
didn
t
run
after
him
said
alyosha
getting
up
from
his
chair
and
walking
thoughtfully
across
the
room
how
so
how
is
it
better
now
they
are
without
food
and
their
case
is
hopeless
not
hopeless
for
the
two
hundred
roubles
will
still
come
to
them
he
ll
take
the
money
to
morrow
to
morrow
he
will
be
sure
to
take
it
said
alyosha
pacing
up
and
down
pondering
you
see
lise
he
went
on
stopping
suddenly
before
her
i
made
one
blunder
but
that
even
that
is
all
for
the
best
what
blunder
and
why
is
it
for
the
best
i
ll
tell
you
he
is
a
man
of
weak
and
timorous
character
he
has
suffered
so
much
and
is
very
good
natured
i
keep
wondering
why
he
took
offense
so
suddenly
for
i
assure
you
up
to
the
last
minute
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
going
to
trample
on
the
notes
and
i
think
now
that
there
was
a
great
deal
to
offend
him
and
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
in
his
position
to
begin
with
he
was
sore
at
having
been
so
glad
of
the
money
in
my
presence
and
not
having
concealed
it
from
me
if
he
had
been
pleased
but
not
so
much
if
he
had
not
shown
it
if
he
had
begun
affecting
scruples
and
difficulties
as
other
people
do
when
they
take
money
he
might
still
endure
to
take
it
but
he
was
too
genuinely
delighted
and
that
was
mortifying
ah
lise
he
is
a
good
and
truthful
man
that
s
the
worst
of
the
whole
business
all
the
while
he
talked
his
voice
was
so
weak
so
broken
he
talked
so
fast
so
fast
he
kept
laughing
such
a
laugh
or
perhaps
he
was
crying
yes
i
am
sure
he
was
crying
he
was
so
delighted
and
he
talked
about
his
daughters
and
about
the
situation
he
could
get
in
another
town
and
when
he
had
poured
out
his
heart
he
felt
ashamed
at
having
shown
me
his
inmost
soul
like
that
so
he
began
to
hate
me
at
once
he
is
one
of
those
awfully
sensitive
poor
people
what
had
made
him
feel
most
ashamed
was
that
he
had
given
in
too
soon
and
accepted
me
as
a
friend
you
see
at
first
he
almost
flew
at
me
and
tried
to
intimidate
me
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
money
he
had
begun
embracing
me
he
kept
touching
me
with
his
hands
this
must
have
been
how
he
came
to
feel
it
all
so
humiliating
and
then
i
made
that
blunder
a
very
important
one
i
suddenly
said
to
him
that
if
he
had
not
money
enough
to
move
to
another
town
we
would
give
it
to
him
and
indeed
i
myself
would
give
him
as
much
as
he
wanted
out
of
my
own
money
that
struck
him
all
at
once
why
he
thought
did
i
put
myself
forward
to
help
him
you
know
lise
it
s
awfully
hard
for
a
man
who
has
been
injured
when
other
people
look
at
him
as
though
they
were
his
benefactors
i
ve
heard
that
father
zossima
told
me
so
i
don
t
know
how
to
put
it
but
i
have
often
seen
it
myself
and
i
feel
like
that
myself
too
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
though
he
did
not
know
up
to
the
very
last
minute
that
he
would
trample
on
the
notes
he
had
a
kind
of
presentiment
of
it
i
am
sure
of
that
that
s
just
what
made
him
so
ecstatic
that
he
had
that
presentiment
and
though
it
s
so
dreadful
it
s
all
for
the
best
in
fact
i
believe
nothing
better
could
have
happened
why
why
could
nothing
better
have
happened
cried
lise
looking
with
great
surprise
at
alyosha
because
if
he
had
taken
the
money
in
an
hour
after
getting
home
he
would
be
crying
with
mortification
that
s
just
what
would
have
happened
and
most
likely
he
would
have
come
to
me
early
to
morrow
and
perhaps
have
flung
the
notes
at
me
and
trampled
upon
them
as
he
did
just
now
but
now
he
has
gone
home
awfully
proud
and
triumphant
though
he
knows
he
has
ruined
himself
so
now
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
make
him
accept
the
two
hundred
roubles
by
to
morrow
for
he
has
already
vindicated
his
honor
tossed
away
the
money
and
trampled
it
under
foot
he
couldn
t
know
when
he
did
it
that
i
should
bring
it
to
him
again
to
morrow
and
yet
he
is
in
terrible
need
of
that
money
though
he
is
proud
of
himself
now
yet
even
to
day
he
ll
be
thinking
what
a
help
he
has
lost
he
will
think
of
it
more
than
ever
at
night
will
dream
of
it
and
by
to
morrow
morning
he
may
be
ready
to
run
to
me
to
ask
forgiveness
it
s
just
then
that
i
ll
appear
here
you
are
a
proud
man
i
shall
say
you
have
shown
it
but
now
take
the
money
and
forgive
us
and
then
he
will
take
it
alyosha
was
carried
away
with
joy
as
he
uttered
his
last
words
and
then
he
will
take
it
lise
clapped
her
hands
ah
that
s
true
i
understand
that
perfectly
now
ah
alyosha
how
do
you
know
all
this
so
young
and
yet
he
knows
what
s
in
the
heart
i
should
never
have
worked
it
out
the
great
thing
now
is
to
persuade
him
that
he
is
on
an
equal
footing
with
us
in
spite
of
his
taking
money
from
us
alyosha
went
on
in
his
excitement
and
not
only
on
an
equal
but
even
on
a
higher
footing
on
a
higher
footing
is
charming
alexey
fyodorovitch
but
go
on
go
on
you
mean
there
isn
t
such
an
expression
as
on
a
higher
footing
but
that
doesn
t
matter
because
oh
no
of
course
it
doesn
t
matter
forgive
me
alyosha
dear
you
know
i
scarcely
respected
you
till
now
that
is
i
respected
you
but
on
an
equal
footing
but
now
i
shall
begin
to
respect
you
on
a
higher
footing
don
t
be
angry
dear
at
my
joking
she
put
in
at
once
with
strong
feeling
i
am
absurd
and
small
but
you
you
listen
alexey
fyodorovitch
isn
t
there
in
all
our
analysis
i
mean
your
analysis
no
better
call
it
ours
aren
t
we
showing
contempt
for
him
for
that
poor
man
in
analyzing
his
soul
like
this
as
it
were
from
above
eh
in
deciding
so
certainly
that
he
will
take
the
money
no
lise
it
s
not
contempt
alyosha
answered
as
though
he
had
prepared
himself
for
the
question
i
was
thinking
of
that
on
the
way
here
how
can
it
be
contempt
when
we
are
all
like
him
when
we
are
all
just
the
same
as
he
is
for
you
know
we
are
just
the
same
no
better
if
we
are
better
we
should
have
been
just
the
same
in
his
place
i
don
t
know
about
you
lise
but
i
consider
that
i
have
a
sordid
soul
in
many
ways
and
his
soul
is
not
sordid
on
the
contrary
full
of
fine
feeling
no
lise
i
have
no
contempt
for
him
do
you
know
lise
my
elder
told
me
once
to
care
for
most
people
exactly
as
one
would
for
children
and
for
some
of
them
as
one
would
for
the
sick
in
hospitals
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
dear
let
us
care
for
people
as
we
would
for
the
sick
let
us
lise
i
am
ready
though
i
am
not
altogether
ready
in
myself
i
am
sometimes
very
impatient
and
at
other
times
i
don
t
see
things
it
s
different
with
you
ah
i
don
t
believe
it
alexey
fyodorovitch
how
happy
i
am
i
am
so
glad
you
say
so
lise
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
are
wonderfully
good
but
you
are
sometimes
sort
of
formal
and
yet
you
are
not
a
bit
formal
really
go
to
the
door
open
it
gently
and
see
whether
mamma
is
listening
said
lise
in
a
nervous
hurried
whisper
alyosha
went
opened
the
door
and
reported
that
no
one
was
listening
come
here
alexey
fyodorovitch
lise
went
on
flushing
redder
and
redder
give
me
your
hand
that
s
right
i
have
to
make
a
great
confession
i
didn
t
write
to
you
yesterday
in
joke
but
in
earnest
and
she
hid
her
eyes
with
her
hand
it
was
evident
that
she
was
greatly
ashamed
of
the
confession
suddenly
she
snatched
his
hand
and
impulsively
kissed
it
three
times
ah
lise
what
a
good
thing
cried
alyosha
joyfully
you
know
i
was
perfectly
sure
you
were
in
earnest
sure
upon
my
word
she
put
aside
his
hand
but
did
not
leave
go
of
it
blushing
hotly
and
laughing
a
little
happy
laugh
i
kiss
his
hand
and
he
says
what
a
good
thing
but
her
reproach
was
undeserved
alyosha
too
was
greatly
overcome
i
should
like
to
please
you
always
lise
but
i
don
t
know
how
to
do
it
he
muttered
blushing
too
alyosha
dear
you
are
cold
and
rude
do
you
see
he
has
chosen
me
as
his
wife
and
is
quite
settled
about
it
he
is
sure
i
was
in
earnest
what
a
thing
to
say
why
that
s
impertinence
that
s
what
it
is
why
was
it
wrong
of
me
to
feel
sure
alyosha
asked
laughing
suddenly
ah
alyosha
on
the
contrary
it
was
delightfully
right
cried
lise
looking
tenderly
and
happily
at
him
alyosha
stood
still
holding
her
hand
in
his
suddenly
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
on
her
lips
oh
what
are
you
doing
cried
lise
alyosha
was
terribly
abashed
oh
forgive
me
if
i
shouldn
t
perhaps
i
m
awfully
stupid
you
said
i
was
cold
so
i
kissed
you
but
i
see
it
was
stupid
lise
laughed
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
in
that
dress
she
ejaculated
in
the
midst
of
her
mirth
but
she
suddenly
ceased
laughing
and
became
serious
almost
stern
alyosha
we
must
put
off
kissing
we
are
not
ready
for
that
yet
and
we
shall
have
a
long
time
to
wait
she
ended
suddenly
tell
me
rather
why
you
who
are
so
clever
so
intellectual
so
observant
choose
a
little
idiot
an
invalid
like
me
ah
alyosha
i
am
awfully
happy
for
i
don
t
deserve
you
a
bit
you
do
lise
i
shall
be
leaving
the
monastery
altogether
in
a
few
days
if
i
go
into
the
world
i
must
marry
i
know
that
he
told
me
to
marry
too
whom
could
i
marry
better
than
you
and
who
would
have
me
except
you
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
in
the
first
place
you
ve
known
me
from
a
child
and
you
ve
a
great
many
qualities
i
haven
t
you
are
more
light
hearted
than
i
am
above
all
you
are
more
innocent
than
i
am
i
have
been
brought
into
contact
with
many
many
things
already
ah
you
don
t
know
but
i
too
am
a
karamazov
what
does
it
matter
if
you
do
laugh
and
make
jokes
and
at
me
too
go
on
laughing
i
am
so
glad
you
do
you
laugh
like
a
little
child
but
you
think
like
a
martyr
like
a
martyr
how
yes
lise
your
question
just
now
whether
we
weren
t
showing
contempt
for
that
poor
man
by
dissecting
his
soul
that
was
the
question
of
a
sufferer
you
see
i
don
t
know
how
to
express
it
but
any
one
who
thinks
of
such
questions
is
capable
of
suffering
sitting
in
your
invalid
chair
you
must
have
thought
over
many
things
already
alyosha
give
me
your
hand
why
are
you
taking
it
away
murmured
lise
in
a
failing
voice
weak
with
happiness
listen
alyosha
what
will
you
wear
when
you
come
out
of
the
monastery
what
sort
of
suit
don
t
laugh
don
t
be
angry
it
s
very
very
important
to
me
i
haven
t
thought
about
the
suit
lise
but
i
ll
wear
whatever
you
like
i
should
like
you
to
have
a
dark
blue
velvet
coat
a
white
piqu
waistcoat
and
a
soft
gray
felt
hat
tell
me
did
you
believe
that
i
didn
t
care
for
you
when
i
said
i
didn
t
mean
what
i
wrote
no
i
didn
t
believe
it
oh
you
insupportable
person
you
are
incorrigible
you
see
i
knew
that
you
seemed
to
care
for
me
but
i
pretended
to
believe
that
you
didn
t
care
for
me
to
make
it
easier
for
you
that
makes
it
worse
worse
and
better
than
all
alyosha
i
am
awfully
fond
of
you
just
before
you
came
this
morning
i
tried
my
fortune
i
decided
i
would
ask
you
for
my
letter
and
if
you
brought
it
out
calmly
and
gave
it
to
me
as
might
have
been
expected
from
you
it
would
mean
that
you
did
not
love
me
at
all
that
you
felt
nothing
and
were
simply
a
stupid
boy
good
for
nothing
and
that
i
am
ruined
but
you
left
the
letter
at
home
and
that
cheered
me
you
left
it
behind
on
purpose
so
as
not
to
give
it
back
because
you
knew
i
would
ask
for
it
that
was
it
wasn
t
it
ah
lise
it
was
not
so
a
bit
the
letter
is
with
me
now
and
it
was
this
morning
in
this
pocket
here
it
is
alyosha
pulled
the
letter
out
laughing
and
showed
it
her
at
a
distance
but
i
am
not
going
to
give
it
to
you
look
at
it
from
here
why
then
you
told
a
lie
you
a
monk
told
a
lie
i
told
a
lie
if
you
like
alyosha
laughed
too
i
told
a
lie
so
as
not
to
give
you
back
the
letter
it
s
very
precious
to
me
he
added
suddenly
with
strong
feeling
and
again
he
flushed
it
always
will
be
and
i
won
t
give
it
up
to
any
one
lise
looked
at
him
joyfully
alyosha
she
murmured
again
look
at
the
door
isn
t
mamma
listening
very
well
lise
i
ll
look
but
wouldn
t
it
be
better
not
to
look
why
suspect
your
mother
of
such
meanness
what
meanness
as
for
her
spying
on
her
daughter
it
s
her
right
it
s
not
meanness
cried
lise
firing
up
you
may
be
sure
alexey
fyodorovitch
that
when
i
am
a
mother
if
i
have
a
daughter
like
myself
i
shall
certainly
spy
on
her
really
lise
that
s
not
right
oh
my
goodness
what
has
meanness
to
do
with
it
if
she
were
listening
to
some
ordinary
worldly
conversation
it
would
be
meanness
but
when
her
own
daughter
is
shut
up
with
a
young
man
listen
alyosha
do
you
know
i
shall
spy
upon
you
as
soon
as
we
are
married
and
let
me
tell
you
i
shall
open
all
your
letters
and
read
them
so
you
may
as
well
be
prepared
yes
of
course
if
so
muttered
alyosha
only
it
s
not
right
ah
how
contemptuous
alyosha
dear
we
won
t
quarrel
the
very
first
day
i
d
better
tell
you
the
whole
truth
of
course
it
s
very
wrong
to
spy
on
people
and
of
course
i
am
not
right
and
you
are
only
i
shall
spy
on
you
all
the
same
do
then
you
won
t
find
out
anything
laughed
alyosha
and
alyosha
will
you
give
in
to
me
we
must
decide
that
too
i
shall
be
delighted
to
lise
and
certain
to
only
not
in
the
most
important
things
even
if
you
don
t
agree
with
me
i
shall
do
my
duty
in
the
most
important
things
that
s
right
but
let
me
tell
you
i
am
ready
to
give
in
to
you
not
only
in
the
most
important
matters
but
in
everything
and
i
am
ready
to
vow
to
do
so
now
in
everything
and
for
all
my
life
cried
lise
fervently
and
i
ll
do
it
gladly
gladly
what
s
more
i
ll
swear
never
to
spy
on
you
never
once
never
to
read
one
of
your
letters
for
you
are
right
and
i
am
not
and
though
i
shall
be
awfully
tempted
to
spy
i
know
that
i
won
t
do
it
since
you
consider
it
dishonorable
you
are
my
conscience
now
listen
alexey
fyodorovitch
why
have
you
been
so
sad
lately
both
yesterday
and
to
day
i
know
you
have
a
lot
of
anxiety
and
trouble
but
i
see
you
have
some
special
grief
besides
some
secret
one
perhaps
yes
lise
i
have
a
secret
one
too
answered
alyosha
mournfully
i
see
you
love
me
since
you
guessed
that
what
grief
what
about
can
you
tell
me
asked
lise
with
timid
entreaty
i
ll
tell
you
later
lise
afterwards
said
alyosha
confused
now
you
wouldn
t
understand
it
perhaps
and
perhaps
i
couldn
t
explain
it
i
know
your
brothers
and
your
father
are
worrying
you
too
yes
my
brothers
too
murmured
alyosha
pondering
i
don
t
like
your
brother
ivan
alyosha
said
lise
suddenly
he
noticed
this
remark
with
some
surprise
but
did
not
answer
it
my
brothers
are
destroying
themselves
he
went
on
my
father
too
and
they
are
destroying
others
with
them
it
s
the
primitive
force
of
the
karamazovs
as
father
pa
ssy
said
the
other
day
a
crude
unbridled
earthly
force
does
the
spirit
of
god
move
above
that
force
even
that
i
don
t
know
i
only
know
that
i
too
am
a
karamazov
me
a
monk
a
monk
am
i
a
monk
lise
you
said
just
now
that
i
was
yes
i
did
and
perhaps
i
don
t
even
believe
in
god
you
don
t
believe
what
is
the
matter
said
lise
quietly
and
gently
but
alyosha
did
not
answer
there
was
something
too
mysterious
too
subjective
in
these
last
words
of
his
perhaps
obscure
to
himself
but
yet
torturing
him
and
now
on
the
top
of
it
all
my
friend
the
best
man
in
the
world
is
going
is
leaving
the
earth
if
you
knew
lise
how
bound
up
in
soul
i
am
with
him
and
then
i
shall
be
left
alone
i
shall
come
to
you
lise
for
the
future
we
will
be
together
yes
together
together
henceforward
we
shall
be
always
together
all
our
lives
listen
kiss
me
i
allow
you
alyosha
kissed
her
come
now
go
christ
be
with
you
and
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
make
haste
back
to
him
while
he
is
alive
i
see
i
ve
kept
you
cruelly
i
ll
pray
to
day
for
him
and
you
alyosha
we
shall
be
happy
shall
we
be
happy
shall
we
i
believe
we
shall
lise
alyosha
thought
it
better
not
to
go
in
to
madame
hohlakov
and
was
going
out
of
the
house
without
saying
good
by
to
her
but
no
sooner
had
he
opened
the
door
than
he
found
madame
hohlakov
standing
before
him
from
the
first
word
alyosha
guessed
that
she
had
been
waiting
on
purpose
to
meet
him
alexey
fyodorovitch
this
is
awful
this
is
all
childish
nonsense
and
ridiculous
i
trust
you
won
t
dream
it
s
foolishness
nothing
but
foolishness
she
said
attacking
him
at
once
only
don
t
tell
her
that
said
alyosha
or
she
will
be
upset
and
that
s
bad
for
her
now
sensible
advice
from
a
sensible
young
man
am
i
to
understand
that
you
only
agreed
with
her
from
compassion
for
her
invalid
state
because
you
didn
t
want
to
irritate
her
by
contradiction
oh
no
not
at
all
i
was
quite
serious
in
what
i
said
alyosha
declared
stoutly
to
be
serious
about
it
is
impossible
unthinkable
and
in
the
first
place
i
shall
never
be
at
home
to
you
again
and
i
shall
take
her
away
you
may
be
sure
of
that
but
why
asked
alyosha
it
s
all
so
far
off
we
may
have
to
wait
another
year
and
a
half
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
that
s
true
of
course
and
you
ll
have
time
to
quarrel
and
separate
a
thousand
times
in
a
year
and
a
half
but
i
am
so
unhappy
though
it
s
such
nonsense
it
s
a
great
blow
to
me
i
feel
like
famusov
in
the
last
scene
of
sorrow
from
wit
you
are
tchatsky
and
she
is
sofya
and
only
fancy
i
ve
run
down
to
meet
you
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
play
the
fatal
scene
takes
place
on
the
staircase
i
heard
it
all
i
almost
dropped
so
this
is
the
explanation
of
her
dreadful
night
and
her
hysterics
of
late
it
means
love
to
the
daughter
but
death
to
the
mother
i
might
as
well
be
in
my
grave
at
once
and
a
more
serious
matter
still
what
is
this
letter
she
has
written
show
it
me
at
once
at
once
no
there
s
no
need
tell
me
how
is
katerina
ivanovna
now
i
must
know
she
still
lies
in
delirium
she
has
not
regained
consciousness
her
aunts
are
here
but
they
do
nothing
but
sigh
and
give
themselves
airs
herzenstube
came
and
he
was
so
alarmed
that
i
didn
t
know
what
to
do
for
him
i
nearly
sent
for
a
doctor
to
look
after
him
he
was
driven
home
in
my
carriage
and
on
the
top
of
it
all
you
and
this
letter
it
s
true
nothing
can
happen
for
a
year
and
a
half
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
holy
in
the
name
of
your
dying
elder
show
me
that
letter
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
m
her
mother
hold
it
in
your
hand
if
you
like
and
i
will
read
it
so
no
i
won
t
show
it
to
you
even
if
she
sanctioned
it
i
wouldn
t
i
am
coming
to
morrow
and
if
you
like
we
can
talk
over
many
things
but
now
good
by
and
alyosha
ran
downstairs
and
into
the
street
chapter
ii
smerdyakov
with
a
guitar
he
had
no
time
to
lose
indeed
even
while
he
was
saying
good
by
to
lise
the
thought
had
struck
him
that
he
must
attempt
some
stratagem
to
find
his
brother
dmitri
who
was
evidently
keeping
out
of
his
way
it
was
getting
late
nearly
three
o
clock
alyosha
s
whole
soul
turned
to
the
monastery
to
his
dying
saint
but
the
necessity
of
seeing
dmitri
outweighed
everything
the
conviction
that
a
great
inevitable
catastrophe
was
about
to
happen
grew
stronger
in
alyosha
s
mind
with
every
hour
what
that
catastrophe
was
and
what
he
would
say
at
that
moment
to
his
brother
he
could
perhaps
not
have
said
definitely
even
if
my
benefactor
must
die
without
me
anyway
i
won
t
have
to
reproach
myself
all
my
life
with
the
thought
that
i
might
have
saved
something
and
did
not
but
passed
by
and
hastened
home
if
i
do
as
i
intend
i
shall
be
following
his
great
precept
his
plan
was
to
catch
his
brother
dmitri
unawares
to
climb
over
the
fence
as
he
had
the
day
before
get
into
the
garden
and
sit
in
the
summer
house
if
dmitri
were
not
there
thought
alyosha
he
would
not
announce
himself
to
foma
or
the
women
of
the
house
but
would
remain
hidden
in
the
summer
house
even
if
he
had
to
wait
there
till
evening
if
as
before
dmitri
were
lying
in
wait
for
grushenka
to
come
he
would
be
very
likely
to
come
to
the
summer
house
alyosha
did
not
however
give
much
thought
to
the
details
of
his
plan
but
resolved
to
act
upon
it
even
if
it
meant
not
getting
back
to
the
monastery
that
day
everything
happened
without
hindrance
he
climbed
over
the
hurdle
almost
in
the
same
spot
as
the
day
before
and
stole
into
the
summer
house
unseen
he
did
not
want
to
be
noticed
the
woman
of
the
house
and
foma
too
if
he
were
here
might
be
loyal
to
his
brother
and
obey
his
instructions
and
so
refuse
to
let
alyosha
come
into
the
garden
or
might
warn
dmitri
that
he
was
being
sought
and
inquired
for
there
was
no
one
in
the
summer
house
alyosha
sat
down
and
began
to
wait
he
looked
round
the
summer
house
which
somehow
struck
him
as
a
great
deal
more
ancient
than
before
though
the
day
was
just
as
fine
as
yesterday
it
seemed
a
wretched
little
place
this
time
there
was
a
circle
on
the
table
left
no
doubt
from
the
glass
of
brandy
having
been
spilt
the
day
before
foolish
and
irrelevant
ideas
strayed
about
his
mind
as
they
always
do
in
a
time
of
tedious
waiting
he
wondered
for
instance
why
he
had
sat
down
precisely
in
the
same
place
as
before
why
not
in
the
other
seat
at
last
he
felt
very
depressed
depressed
by
suspense
and
uncertainty
but
he
had
not
sat
there
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
he
suddenly
heard
the
thrum
of
a
guitar
somewhere
quite
close
people
were
sitting
or
had
only
just
sat
down
somewhere
in
the
bushes
not
more
than
twenty
paces
away
alyosha
suddenly
recollected
that
on
coming
out
of
the
summer
house
the
day
before
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
old
green
low
garden
seat
among
the
bushes
on
the
left
by
the
fence
the
people
must
be
sitting
on
it
now
who
were
they
a
man
s
voice
suddenly
began
singing
in
a
sugary
falsetto
accompanying
himself
on
the
guitar
with
invincible
force
i
am
bound
to
my
dear
o
lord
have
mercy
on
her
and
on
me
on
her
and
on
me
on
her
and
on
me
the
voice
ceased
it
was
a
lackey
s
tenor
and
a
lackey
s
song
another
voice
a
woman
s
suddenly
asked
insinuatingly
and
bashfully
though
with
mincing
affectation
why
haven
t
you
been
to
see
us
for
so
long
pavel
fyodorovitch
why
do
you
always
look
down
upon
us
not
at
all
answered
a
man
s
voice
politely
but
with
emphatic
dignity
it
was
clear
that
the
man
had
the
best
of
the
position
and
that
the
woman
was
making
advances
i
believe
the
man
must
be
smerdyakov
thought
alyosha
from
his
voice
and
the
lady
must
be
the
daughter
of
the
house
here
who
has
come
from
moscow
the
one
who
wears
the
dress
with
a
tail
and
goes
to
marfa
for
soup
i
am
awfully
fond
of
verses
of
all
kinds
if
they
rhyme
the
woman
s
voice
continued
why
don
t
you
go
on
the
man
sang
again
what
do
i
care
for
royal
wealth
if
but
my
dear
one
be
in
health
lord
have
mercy
on
her
and
on
me
on
her
and
on
me
on
her
and
on
me
it
was
even
better
last
time
observed
the
woman
s
voice
you
sang
if
my
darling
be
in
health
it
sounded
more
tender
i
suppose
you
ve
forgotten
to
day
poetry
is
rubbish
said
smerdyakov
curtly
oh
no
i
am
very
fond
of
poetry
so
far
as
it
s
poetry
it
s
essential
rubbish
consider
yourself
who
ever
talks
in
rhyme
and
if
we
were
all
to
talk
in
rhyme
even
though
it
were
decreed
by
government
we
shouldn
t
say
much
should
we
poetry
is
no
good
marya
kondratyevna
how
clever
you
are
how
is
it
you
ve
gone
so
deep
into
everything
the
woman
s
voice
was
more
and
more
insinuating
i
could
have
done
better
than
that
i
could
have
known
more
than
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
destiny
from
my
childhood
up
i
would
have
shot
a
man
in
a
duel
if
he
called
me
names
because
i
am
descended
from
a
filthy
beggar
and
have
no
father
and
they
used
to
throw
it
in
my
teeth
in
moscow
it
had
reached
them
from
here
thanks
to
grigory
vassilyevitch
grigory
vassilyevitch
blames
me
for
rebelling
against
my
birth
but
i
would
have
sanctioned
their
killing
me
before
i
was
born
that
i
might
not
have
come
into
the
world
at
all
they
used
to
say
in
the
market
and
your
mamma
too
with
great
lack
of
delicacy
set
off
telling
me
that
her
hair
was
like
a
mat
on
her
head
and
that
she
was
short
of
five
foot
by
a
wee
bit
why
talk
of
a
wee
bit
while
she
might
have
said
a
little
bit
like
every
one
else
she
wanted
to
make
it
touching
a
regular
peasant
s
feeling
can
a
russian
peasant
be
said
to
feel
in
comparison
with
an
educated
man
he
can
t
be
said
to
have
feeling
at
all
in
his
ignorance
from
my
childhood
up
when
i
hear
a
wee
bit
i
am
ready
to
burst
with
rage
i
hate
all
russia
marya
kondratyevna
if
you
d
been
a
cadet
in
the
army
or
a
young
hussar
you
wouldn
t
have
talked
like
that
but
would
have
drawn
your
saber
to
defend
all
russia
i
don
t
want
to
be
a
hussar
marya
kondratyevna
and
what
s
more
i
should
like
to
abolish
all
soldiers
and
when
an
enemy
comes
who
is
going
to
defend
us
there
s
no
need
of
defense
in
1812
there
was
a
great
invasion
of
russia
by
napoleon
first
emperor
of
the
french
father
of
the
present
one
and
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
if
they
had
conquered
us
a
clever
nation
would
have
conquered
a
very
stupid
one
and
annexed
it
we
should
have
had
quite
different
institutions
are
they
so
much
better
in
their
own
country
than
we
are
i
wouldn
t
change
a
dandy
i
know
of
for
three
young
englishmen
observed
marya
kondratyevna
tenderly
doubtless
accompanying
her
words
with
a
most
languishing
glance
that
s
as
one
prefers
but
you
are
just
like
a
foreigner
just
like
a
most
gentlemanly
foreigner
i
tell
you
that
though
it
makes
me
bashful
if
you
care
to
know
the
folks
there
and
ours
here
are
just
alike
in
their
vice
they
are
swindlers
only
there
the
scoundrel
wears
polished
boots
and
here
he
grovels
in
filth
and
sees
no
harm
in
it
the
russian
people
want
thrashing
as
fyodor
pavlovitch
said
very
truly
yesterday
though
he
is
mad
and
all
his
children
you
said
yourself
you
had
such
a
respect
for
ivan
fyodorovitch
but
he
said
i
was
a
stinking
lackey
he
thinks
that
i
might
be
unruly
he
is
mistaken
there
if
i
had
a
certain
sum
in
my
pocket
i
would
have
left
here
long
ago
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
lower
than
any
lackey
in
his
behavior
in
his
mind
and
in
his
poverty
he
doesn
t
know
how
to
do
anything
and
yet
he
is
respected
by
every
one
i
may
be
only
a
soup
maker
but
with
luck
i
could
open
a
caf
restaurant
in
petrovka
in
moscow
for
my
cookery
is
something
special
and
there
s
no
one
in
moscow
except
the
foreigners
whose
cookery
is
anything
special
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
a
beggar
but
if
he
were
to
challenge
the
son
of
the
first
count
in
the
country
he
d
fight
him
though
in
what
way
is
he
better
than
i
am
for
he
is
ever
so
much
stupider
than
i
am
look
at
the
money
he
has
wasted
without
any
need
it
must
be
lovely
a
duel
marya
kondratyevna
observed
suddenly
how
so
it
must
be
so
dreadful
and
so
brave
especially
when
young
officers
with
pistols
in
their
hands
pop
at
one
another
for
the
sake
of
some
lady
a
perfect
picture
ah
if
only
girls
were
allowed
to
look
on
i
d
give
anything
to
see
one
it
s
all
very
well
when
you
are
firing
at
some
one
but
when
he
is
firing
straight
in
your
mug
you
must
feel
pretty
silly
you
d
be
glad
to
run
away
marya
kondratyevna
you
don
t
mean
you
would
run
away
but
smerdyakov
did
not
deign
to
reply
after
a
moment
s
silence
the
guitar
tinkled
again
and
he
sang
again
in
the
same
falsetto
whatever
you
may
say
i
shall
go
far
away
life
will
be
bright
and
gay
in
the
city
far
away
i
shall
not
grieve
i
shall
not
grieve
at
all
i
don
t
intend
to
grieve
at
all
then
something
unexpected
happened
alyosha
suddenly
sneezed
they
were
silent
alyosha
got
up
and
walked
towards
them
he
found
smerdyakov
dressed
up
and
wearing
polished
boots
his
hair
pomaded
and
perhaps
curled
the
guitar
lay
on
the
garden
seat
his
companion
was
the
daughter
of
the
house
wearing
a
light
blue
dress
with
a
train
two
yards
long
she
was
young
and
would
not
have
been
bad
looking
but
that
her
face
was
so
round
and
terribly
freckled
will
my
brother
dmitri
soon
be
back
asked
alyosha
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
smerdyakov
got
up
slowly
marya
kondratyevna
rose
too
how
am
i
to
know
about
dmitri
fyodorovitch
it
s
not
as
if
i
were
his
keeper
answered
smerdyakov
quietly
distinctly
and
superciliously
but
i
simply
asked
whether
you
do
know
alyosha
explained
i
know
nothing
of
his
whereabouts
and
don
t
want
to
but
my
brother
told
me
that
you
let
him
know
all
that
goes
on
in
the
house
and
promised
to
let
him
know
when
agrafena
alexandrovna
comes
smerdyakov
turned
a
deliberate
unmoved
glance
upon
him
and
how
did
you
get
in
this
time
since
the
gate
was
bolted
an
hour
ago
he
asked
looking
at
alyosha
i
came
in
from
the
back
alley
over
the
fence
and
went
straight
to
the
summer
house
i
hope
you
ll
forgive
me
he
added
addressing
marya
kondratyevna
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
find
my
brother
ach
as
though
we
could
take
it
amiss
in
you
drawled
marya
kondratyevna
flattered
by
alyosha
s
apology
for
dmitri
fyodorovitch
often
goes
to
the
summer
house
in
that
way
we
don
t
know
he
is
here
and
he
is
sitting
in
the
summer
house
i
am
very
anxious
to
find
him
or
to
learn
from
you
where
he
is
now
believe
me
it
s
on
business
of
great
importance
to
him
he
never
tells
us
lisped
marya
kondratyevna
though
i
used
to
come
here
as
a
friend
smerdyakov
began
again
dmitri
fyodorovitch
has
pestered
me
in
a
merciless
way
even
here
by
his
incessant
questions
about
the
master
what
news
he
ll
ask
what
s
going
on
in
there
now
who
s
coming
and
going
and
can
t
i
tell
him
something
more
twice
already
he
s
threatened
me
with
death
with
death
alyosha
exclaimed
in
surprise
do
you
suppose
he
d
think
much
of
that
with
his
temper
which
you
had
a
chance
of
observing
yourself
yesterday
he
says
if
i
let
agrafena
alexandrovna
in
and
she
passes
the
night
there
i
ll
be
the
first
to
suffer
for
it
i
am
terribly
afraid
of
him
and
if
i
were
not
even
more
afraid
of
doing
so
i
ought
to
let
the
police
know
god
only
knows
what
he
might
not
do
his
honor
said
to
him
the
other
day
i
ll
pound
you
in
a
mortar
added
marya
kondratyevna
oh
if
it
s
pounding
in
a
mortar
it
may
be
only
talk
observed
alyosha
if
i
could
meet
him
i
might
speak
to
him
about
that
too
well
the
only
thing
i
can
tell
you
is
this
said
smerdyakov
as
though
thinking
better
of
it
i
am
here
as
an
old
friend
and
neighbor
and
it
would
be
odd
if
i
didn
t
come
on
the
other
hand
ivan
fyodorovitch
sent
me
first
thing
this
morning
to
your
brother
s
lodging
in
lake
street
without
a
letter
but
with
a
message
to
dmitri
fyodorovitch
to
go
to
dine
with
him
at
the
restaurant
here
in
the
market
place
i
went
but
didn
t
find
dmitri
fyodorovitch
at
home
though
it
was
eight
o
clock
he
s
been
here
but
he
is
quite
gone
those
were
the
very
words
of
his
landlady
it
s
as
though
there
was
an
understanding
between
them
perhaps
at
this
moment
he
is
in
the
restaurant
with
ivan
fyodorovitch
for
ivan
fyodorovitch
has
not
been
home
to
dinner
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
dined
alone
an
hour
ago
and
is
gone
to
lie
down
but
i
beg
you
most
particularly
not
to
speak
of
me
and
of
what
i
have
told
you
for
he
d
kill
me
for
nothing
at
all
brother
ivan
invited
dmitri
to
the
restaurant
to
day
repeated
alyosha
quickly
that
s
so
the
metropolis
tavern
in
the
market
place
the
very
same
that
s
quite
likely
cried
alyosha
much
excited
thank
you
smerdyakov
that
s
important
i
ll
go
there
at
once
don
t
betray
me
smerdyakov
called
after
him
oh
no
i
ll
go
to
the
tavern
as
though
by
chance
don
t
be
anxious
but
wait
a
minute
i
ll
open
the
gate
to
you
cried
marya
kondratyevna
no
it
s
a
short
cut
i
ll
get
over
the
fence
again
what
he
had
heard
threw
alyosha
into
great
agitation
he
ran
to
the
tavern
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
into
the
tavern
in
his
monastic
dress
but
he
could
inquire
at
the
entrance
for
his
brothers
and
call
them
down
but
just
as
he
reached
the
tavern
a
window
was
flung
open
and
his
brother
ivan
called
down
to
him
from
it
alyosha
can
t
you
come
up
here
to
me
i
shall
be
awfully
grateful
to
be
sure
i
can
only
i
don
t
quite
know
whether
in
this
dress
but
i
am
in
a
room
apart
come
up
the
steps
i
ll
run
down
to
meet
you
a
minute
later
alyosha
was
sitting
beside
his
brother
ivan
was
alone
dining
chapter
iii
the
brothers
make
friends
ivan
was
not
however
in
a
separate
room
but
only
in
a
place
shut
off
by
a
screen
so
that
it
was
unseen
by
other
people
in
the
room
it
was
the
first
room
from
the
entrance
with
a
buffet
along
the
wall
waiters
were
continually
darting
to
and
fro
in
it
the
only
customer
in
the
room
was
an
old
retired
military
man
drinking
tea
in
a
corner
but
there
was
the
usual
bustle
going
on
in
the
other
rooms
of
the
tavern
there
were
shouts
for
the
waiters
the
sound
of
popping
corks
the
click
of
billiard
balls
the
drone
of
the
organ
alyosha
knew
that
ivan
did
not
usually
visit
this
tavern
and
disliked
taverns
in
general
so
he
must
have
come
here
he
reflected
simply
to
meet
dmitri
by
arrangement
yet
dmitri
was
not
there
shall
i
order
you
fish
soup
or
anything
you
don
t
live
on
tea
alone
i
suppose
cried
ivan
apparently
delighted
at
having
got
hold
of
alyosha
he
had
finished
dinner
and
was
drinking
tea
let
me
have
soup
and
tea
afterwards
i
am
hungry
said
alyosha
gayly
and
cherry
jam
they
have
it
here
you
remember
how
you
used
to
love
cherry
jam
when
you
were
little
you
remember
that
let
me
have
jam
too
i
like
it
still
ivan
rang
for
the
waiter
and
ordered
soup
jam
and
tea
i
remember
everything
alyosha
i
remember
you
till
you
were
eleven
i
was
nearly
fifteen
there
s
such
a
difference
between
fifteen
and
eleven
that
brothers
are
never
companions
at
those
ages
i
don
t
know
whether
i
was
fond
of
you
even
when
i
went
away
to
moscow
for
the
first
few
years
i
never
thought
of
you
at
all
then
when
you
came
to
moscow
yourself
we
only
met
once
somewhere
i
believe
and
now
i
ve
been
here
more
than
three
months
and
so
far
we
have
scarcely
said
a
word
to
each
other
to
morrow
i
am
going
away
and
i
was
just
thinking
as
i
sat
here
how
i
could
see
you
to
say
good
by
and
just
then
you
passed
were
you
very
anxious
to
see
me
then
very
i
want
to
get
to
know
you
once
for
all
and
i
want
you
to
know
me
and
then
to
say
good
by
i
believe
it
s
always
best
to
get
to
know
people
just
before
leaving
them
i
ve
noticed
how
you
ve
been
looking
at
me
these
three
months
there
has
been
a
continual
look
of
expectation
in
your
eyes
and
i
can
t
endure
that
that
s
how
it
is
i
ve
kept
away
from
you
but
in
the
end
i
have
learned
to
respect
you
the
little
man
stands
firm
i
thought
though
i
am
laughing
i
am
serious
you
do
stand
firm
don
t
you
i
like
people
who
are
firm
like
that
whatever
it
is
they
stand
by
even
if
they
are
such
little
fellows
as
you
your
expectant
eyes
ceased
to
annoy
me
i
grew
fond
of
them
in
the
end
those
expectant
eyes
you
seem
to
love
me
for
some
reason
alyosha
i
do
love
you
ivan
dmitri
says
of
you
ivan
is
a
tomb
i
say
of
you
ivan
is
a
riddle
you
are
a
riddle
to
me
even
now
but
i
understand
something
in
you
and
i
did
not
understand
it
till
this
morning
what
s
that
laughed
ivan
you
won
t
be
angry
alyosha
laughed
too
well
that
you
are
just
as
young
as
other
young
men
of
three
and
twenty
that
you
are
just
a
young
and
fresh
and
nice
boy
green
in
fact
now
have
i
insulted
you
dreadfully
on
the
contrary
i
am
struck
by
a
coincidence
cried
ivan
warmly
and
good
humoredly
would
you
believe
it
that
ever
since
that
scene
with
her
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
but
my
youthful
greenness
and
just
as
though
you
guessed
that
you
begin
about
it
do
you
know
i
ve
been
sitting
here
thinking
to
myself
that
if
i
didn
t
believe
in
life
if
i
lost
faith
in
the
woman
i
love
lost
faith
in
the
order
of
things
were
convinced
in
fact
that
everything
is
a
disorderly
damnable
and
perhaps
devil
ridden
chaos
if
i
were
struck
by
every
horror
of
man
s
disillusionment
still
i
should
want
to
live
and
having
once
tasted
of
the
cup
i
would
not
turn
away
from
it
till
i
had
drained
it
at
thirty
though
i
shall
be
sure
to
leave
the
cup
even
if
i
ve
not
emptied
it
and
turn
away
where
i
don
t
know
but
till
i
am
thirty
i
know
that
my
youth
will
triumph
over
everything
every
disillusionment
every
disgust
with
life
i
ve
asked
myself
many
times
whether
there
is
in
the
world
any
despair
that
would
overcome
this
frantic
and
perhaps
unseemly
thirst
for
life
in
me
and
i
ve
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
isn
t
that
is
till
i
am
thirty
and
then
i
shall
lose
it
of
myself
i
fancy
some
driveling
consumptive
moralists
and
poets
especially
often
call
that
thirst
for
life
base
it
s
a
feature
of
the
karamazovs
it
s
true
that
thirst
for
life
regardless
of
everything
you
have
it
no
doubt
too
but
why
is
it
base
the
centripetal
force
on
our
planet
is
still
fearfully
strong
alyosha
i
have
a
longing
for
life
and
i
go
on
living
in
spite
of
logic
though
i
may
not
believe
in
the
order
of
the
universe
yet
i
love
the
sticky
little
leaves
as
they
open
in
spring
i
love
the
blue
sky
i
love
some
people
whom
one
loves
you
know
sometimes
without
knowing
why
i
love
some
great
deeds
done
by
men
though
i
ve
long
ceased
perhaps
to
have
faith
in
them
yet
from
old
habit
one
s
heart
prizes
them
here
they
have
brought
the
soup
for
you
eat
it
it
will
do
you
good
it
s
first
rate
soup
they
know
how
to
make
it
here
i
want
to
travel
in
europe
alyosha
i
shall
set
off
from
here
and
yet
i
know
that
i
am
only
going
to
a
graveyard
but
it
s
a
most
precious
graveyard
that
s
what
it
is
precious
are
the
dead
that
lie
there
every
stone
over
them
speaks
of
such
burning
life
in
the
past
of
such
passionate
faith
in
their
work
their
truth
their
struggle
and
their
science
that
i
know
i
shall
fall
on
the
ground
and
kiss
those
stones
and
weep
over
them
though
i
m
convinced
in
my
heart
that
it
s
long
been
nothing
but
a
graveyard
and
i
shall
not
weep
from
despair
but
simply
because
i
shall
be
happy
in
my
tears
i
shall
steep
my
soul
in
my
emotion
i
love
the
sticky
leaves
in
spring
the
blue
sky
that
s
all
it
is
it
s
not
a
matter
of
intellect
or
logic
it
s
loving
with
one
s
inside
with
one
s
stomach
one
loves
the
first
strength
of
one
s
youth
do
you
understand
anything
of
my
tirade
alyosha
ivan
laughed
suddenly
i
understand
too
well
ivan
one
longs
to
love
with
one
s
inside
with
one
s
stomach
you
said
that
so
well
and
i
am
awfully
glad
that
you
have
such
a
longing
for
life
cried
alyosha
i
think
every
one
should
love
life
above
everything
in
the
world
love
life
more
than
the
meaning
of
it
certainly
love
it
regardless
of
logic
as
you
say
it
must
be
regardless
of
logic
and
it
s
only
then
one
will
understand
the
meaning
of
it
i
have
thought
so
a
long
time
half
your
work
is
done
ivan
you
love
life
now
you
ve
only
to
try
to
do
the
second
half
and
you
are
saved
you
are
trying
to
save
me
but
perhaps
i
am
not
lost
and
what
does
your
second
half
mean
why
one
has
to
raise
up
your
dead
who
perhaps
have
not
died
after
all
come
let
me
have
tea
i
am
so
glad
of
our
talk
ivan
i
see
you
are
feeling
inspired
i
am
awfully
fond
of
such
professions
de
foi
from
such
novices
you
are
a
steadfast
person
alexey
is
it
true
that
you
mean
to
leave
the
monastery
yes
my
elder
sends
me
out
into
the
world
we
shall
see
each
other
then
in
the
world
we
shall
meet
before
i
am
thirty
when
i
shall
begin
to
turn
aside
from
the
cup
father
doesn
t
want
to
turn
aside
from
his
cup
till
he
is
seventy
he
dreams
of
hanging
on
to
eighty
in
fact
so
he
says
he
means
it
only
too
seriously
though
he
is
a
buffoon
he
stands
on
a
firm
rock
too
he
stands
on
his
sensuality
though
after
we
are
thirty
indeed
there
may
be
nothing
else
to
stand
on
but
to
hang
on
to
seventy
is
nasty
better
only
to
thirty
one
might
retain
a
shadow
of
nobility
by
deceiving
oneself
have
you
seen
dmitri
to
day
no
but
i
saw
smerdyakov
and
alyosha
rapidly
though
minutely
described
his
meeting
with
smerdyakov
ivan
began
listening
anxiously
and
questioned
him
but
he
begged
me
not
to
tell
dmitri
that
he
had
told
me
about
him
added
alyosha
ivan
frowned
and
pondered
are
you
frowning
on
smerdyakov
s
account
asked
alyosha
yes
on
his
account
damn
him
i
certainly
did
want
to
see
dmitri
but
now
there
s
no
need
said
ivan
reluctantly
but
are
you
really
going
so
soon
brother
yes
what
of
dmitri
and
father
how
will
it
end
asked
alyosha
anxiously
you
are
always
harping
upon
it
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
am
i
my
brother
dmitri
s
keeper
ivan
snapped
irritably
but
then
he
suddenly
smiled
bitterly
cain
s
answer
about
his
murdered
brother
wasn
t
it
perhaps
that
s
what
you
re
thinking
at
this
moment
well
damn
it
all
i
can
t
stay
here
to
be
their
keeper
can
i
i
ve
finished
what
i
had
to
do
and
i
am
going
do
you
imagine
i
am
jealous
of
dmitri
that
i
ve
been
trying
to
steal
his
beautiful
katerina
ivanovna
for
the
last
three
months
nonsense
i
had
business
of
my
own
i
finished
it
i
am
going
i
finished
it
just
now
you
were
witness
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
yes
and
i
ve
released
myself
once
for
all
and
after
all
what
have
i
to
do
with
dmitri
dmitri
doesn
t
come
in
i
had
my
own
business
to
settle
with
katerina
ivanovna
you
know
on
the
contrary
that
dmitri
behaved
as
though
there
was
an
understanding
between
us
i
didn
t
ask
him
to
do
it
but
he
solemnly
handed
her
over
to
me
and
gave
us
his
blessing
it
s
all
too
funny
ah
alyosha
if
you
only
knew
how
light
my
heart
is
now
would
you
believe
it
i
sat
here
eating
my
dinner
and
was
nearly
ordering
champagne
to
celebrate
my
first
hour
of
freedom
tfoo
it
s
been
going
on
nearly
six
months
and
all
at
once
i
ve
thrown
it
off
i
could
never
have
guessed
even
yesterday
how
easy
it
would
be
to
put
an
end
to
it
if
i
wanted
you
are
speaking
of
your
love
ivan
of
my
love
if
you
like
i
fell
in
love
with
the
young
lady
i
worried
myself
over
her
and
she
worried
me
i
sat
watching
over
her
and
all
at
once
it
s
collapsed
i
spoke
this
morning
with
inspiration
but
i
went
away
and
roared
with
laughter
would
you
believe
it
yes
it
s
the
literal
truth
you
seem
very
merry
about
it
now
observed
alyosha
looking
into
his
face
which
had
suddenly
grown
brighter
but
how
could
i
tell
that
i
didn
t
care
for
her
a
bit
ha
ha
it
appears
after
all
i
didn
t
and
yet
how
she
attracted
me
how
attractive
she
was
just
now
when
i
made
my
speech
and
do
you
know
she
attracts
me
awfully
even
now
yet
how
easy
it
is
to
leave
her
do
you
think
i
am
boasting
no
only
perhaps
it
wasn
t
love
alyosha
laughed
ivan
don
t
make
reflections
about
love
it
s
unseemly
for
you
how
you
rushed
into
the
discussion
this
morning
i
ve
forgotten
to
kiss
you
for
it
but
how
she
tormented
me
it
certainly
was
sitting
by
a
laceration
ah
she
knew
how
i
loved
her
she
loved
me
and
not
dmitri
ivan
insisted
gayly
her
feeling
for
dmitri
was
simply
a
self
laceration
all
i
told
her
just
now
was
perfectly
true
but
the
worst
of
it
is
it
may
take
her
fifteen
or
twenty
years
to
find
out
that
she
doesn
t
care
for
dmitri
and
loves
me
whom
she
torments
and
perhaps
she
may
never
find
it
out
at
all
in
spite
of
her
lesson
to
day
well
it
s
better
so
i
can
simply
go
away
for
good
by
the
way
how
is
she
now
what
happened
after
i
departed
alyosha
told
him
she
had
been
hysterical
and
that
she
was
now
he
heard
unconscious
and
delirious
isn
t
madame
hohlakov
laying
it
on
i
think
not
i
must
find
out
nobody
dies
of
hysterics
though
they
don
t
matter
god
gave
woman
hysterics
as
a
relief
i
won
t
go
to
her
at
all
why
push
myself
forward
again
but
you
told
her
that
she
had
never
cared
for
you
i
did
that
on
purpose
alyosha
shall
i
call
for
some
champagne
let
us
drink
to
my
freedom
ah
if
only
you
knew
how
glad
i
am
no
brother
we
had
better
not
drink
said
alyosha
suddenly
besides
i
feel
somehow
depressed
yes
you
ve
been
depressed
a
long
time
i
ve
noticed
it
have
you
settled
to
go
to
morrow
morning
then
morning
i
didn
t
say
i
should
go
in
the
morning
but
perhaps
it
may
be
the
morning
would
you
believe
it
i
dined
here
to
day
only
to
avoid
dining
with
the
old
man
i
loathe
him
so
i
should
have
left
long
ago
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
but
why
are
you
so
worried
about
my
going
away
we
ve
plenty
of
time
before
i
go
an
eternity
if
you
are
going
away
to
morrow
what
do
you
mean
by
an
eternity
but
what
does
it
matter
to
us
laughed
ivan
we
ve
time
enough
for
our
talk
for
what
brought
us
here
why
do
you
look
so
surprised
answer
why
have
we
met
here
to
talk
of
my
love
for
katerina
ivanovna
of
the
old
man
and
dmitri
of
foreign
travel
of
the
fatal
position
of
russia
of
the
emperor
napoleon
is
that
it
no
then
you
know
what
for
it
s
different
for
other
people
but
we
in
our
green
youth
have
to
settle
the
eternal
questions
first
of
all
that
s
what
we
care
about
young
russia
is
talking
about
nothing
but
the
eternal
questions
now
just
when
the
old
folks
are
all
taken
up
with
practical
questions
why
have
you
been
looking
at
me
in
expectation
for
the
last
three
months
to
ask
me
what
do
you
believe
or
don
t
you
believe
at
all
that
s
what
your
eyes
have
been
meaning
for
these
three
months
haven
t
they
perhaps
so
smiled
alyosha
you
are
not
laughing
at
me
now
ivan
me
laughing
i
don
t
want
to
wound
my
little
brother
who
has
been
watching
me
with
such
expectation
for
three
months
alyosha
look
straight
at
me
of
course
i
am
just
such
a
little
boy
as
you
are
only
not
a
novice
and
what
have
russian
boys
been
doing
up
till
now
some
of
them
i
mean
in
this
stinking
tavern
for
instance
here
they
meet
and
sit
down
in
a
corner
they
ve
never
met
in
their
lives
before
and
when
they
go
out
of
the
tavern
they
won
t
meet
again
for
forty
years
and
what
do
they
talk
about
in
that
momentary
halt
in
the
tavern
of
the
eternal
questions
of
the
existence
of
god
and
immortality
and
those
who
do
not
believe
in
god
talk
of
socialism
or
anarchism
of
the
transformation
of
all
humanity
on
a
new
pattern
so
that
it
all
comes
to
the
same
they
re
the
same
questions
turned
inside
out
and
masses
masses
of
the
most
original
russian
boys
do
nothing
but
talk
of
the
eternal
questions
isn
t
it
so
yes
for
real
russians
the
questions
of
god
s
existence
and
of
immortality
or
as
you
say
the
same
questions
turned
inside
out
come
first
and
foremost
of
course
and
so
they
should
said
alyosha
still
watching
his
brother
with
the
same
gentle
and
inquiring
smile
well
alyosha
it
s
sometimes
very
unwise
to
be
a
russian
at
all
but
anything
stupider
than
the
way
russian
boys
spend
their
time
one
can
hardly
imagine
but
there
s
one
russian
boy
called
alyosha
i
am
awfully
fond
of
how
nicely
you
put
that
in
alyosha
laughed
suddenly
well
tell
me
where
to
begin
give
your
orders
the
existence
of
god
eh
begin
where
you
like
you
declared
yesterday
at
father
s
that
there
was
no
god
alyosha
looked
searchingly
at
his
brother
i
said
that
yesterday
at
dinner
on
purpose
to
tease
you
and
i
saw
your
eyes
glow
but
now
i
ve
no
objection
to
discussing
with
you
and
i
say
so
very
seriously
i
want
to
be
friends
with
you
alyosha
for
i
have
no
friends
and
want
to
try
it
well
only
fancy
perhaps
i
too
accept
god
laughed
ivan
that
s
a
surprise
for
you
isn
t
it
yes
of
course
if
you
are
not
joking
now
joking
i
was
told
at
the
elder
s
yesterday
that
i
was
joking
you
know
dear
boy
there
was
an
old
sinner
in
the
eighteenth
century
who
declared
that
if
there
were
no
god
he
would
have
to
be
invented
s
il
n
existait
pas
dieu
il
faudrait
l
inventer
and
man
has
actually
invented
god
and
what
s
strange
what
would
be
marvelous
is
not
that
god
should
really
exist
the
marvel
is
that
such
an
idea
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
god
could
enter
the
head
of
such
a
savage
vicious
beast
as
man
so
holy
it
is
so
touching
so
wise
and
so
great
a
credit
it
does
to
man
as
for
me
i
ve
long
resolved
not
to
think
whether
man
created
god
or
god
man
and
i
won
t
go
through
all
the
axioms
laid
down
by
russian
boys
on
that
subject
all
derived
from
european
hypotheses
for
what
s
a
hypothesis
there
is
an
axiom
with
the
russian
boy
and
not
only
with
the
boys
but
with
their
teachers
too
for
our
russian
professors
are
often
just
the
same
boys
themselves
and
so
i
omit
all
the
hypotheses
for
what
are
we
aiming
at
now
i
am
trying
to
explain
as
quickly
as
possible
my
essential
nature
that
is
what
manner
of
man
i
am
what
i
believe
in
and
for
what
i
hope
that
s
it
isn
t
it
and
therefore
i
tell
you
that
i
accept
god
simply
but
you
must
note
this
if
god
exists
and
if
he
really
did
create
the
world
then
as
we
all
know
he
created
it
according
to
the
geometry
of
euclid
and
the
human
mind
with
the
conception
of
only
three
dimensions
in
space
yet
there
have
been
and
still
are
geometricians
and
philosophers
and
even
some
of
the
most
distinguished
who
doubt
whether
the
whole
universe
or
to
speak
more
widely
the
whole
of
being
was
only
created
in
euclid
s
geometry
they
even
dare
to
dream
that
two
parallel
lines
which
according
to
euclid
can
never
meet
on
earth
may
meet
somewhere
in
infinity
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
since
i
can
t
understand
even
that
i
can
t
expect
to
understand
about
god
i
acknowledge
humbly
that
i
have
no
faculty
for
settling
such
questions
i
have
a
euclidian
earthly
mind
and
how
could
i
solve
problems
that
are
not
of
this
world
and
i
advise
you
never
to
think
about
it
either
my
dear
alyosha
especially
about
god
whether
he
exists
or
not
all
such
questions
are
utterly
inappropriate
for
a
mind
created
with
an
idea
of
only
three
dimensions
and
so
i
accept
god
and
am
glad
to
and
what
s
more
i
accept
his
wisdom
his
purpose
which
are
utterly
beyond
our
ken
i
believe
in
the
underlying
order
and
the
meaning
of
life
i
believe
in
the
eternal
harmony
in
which
they
say
we
shall
one
day
be
blended
i
believe
in
the
word
to
which
the
universe
is
striving
and
which
itself
was
with
god
and
which
itself
is
god
and
so
on
and
so
on
to
infinity
there
are
all
sorts
of
phrases
for
it
i
seem
to
be
on
the
right
path
don
t
i
yet
would
you
believe
it
in
the
final
result
i
don
t
accept
this
world
of
god
s
and
although
i
know
it
exists
i
don
t
accept
it
at
all
it
s
not
that
i
don
t
accept
god
you
must
understand
it
s
the
world
created
by
him
i
don
t
and
cannot
accept
let
me
make
it
plain
i
believe
like
a
child
that
suffering
will
be
healed
and
made
up
for
that
all
the
humiliating
absurdity
of
human
contradictions
will
vanish
like
a
pitiful
mirage
like
the
despicable
fabrication
of
the
impotent
and
infinitely
small
euclidian
mind
of
man
that
in
the
world
s
finale
at
the
moment
of
eternal
harmony
something
so
precious
will
come
to
pass
that
it
will
suffice
for
all
hearts
for
the
comforting
of
all
resentments
for
the
atonement
of
all
the
crimes
of
humanity
of
all
the
blood
they
ve
shed
that
it
will
make
it
not
only
possible
to
forgive
but
to
justify
all
that
has
happened
with
men
but
though
all
that
may
come
to
pass
i
don
t
accept
it
i
won
t
accept
it
even
if
parallel
lines
do
meet
and
i
see
it
myself
i
shall
see
it
and
say
that
they
ve
met
but
still
i
won
t
accept
it
that
s
what
s
at
the
root
of
me
alyosha
that
s
my
creed
i
am
in
earnest
in
what
i
say
i
began
our
talk
as
stupidly
as
i
could
on
purpose
but
i
ve
led
up
to
my
confession
for
that
s
all
you
want
you
didn
t
want
to
hear
about
god
but
only
to
know
what
the
brother
you
love
lives
by
and
so
i
ve
told
you
ivan
concluded
his
long
tirade
with
marked
and
unexpected
feeling
and
why
did
you
begin
as
stupidly
as
you
could
asked
alyosha
looking
dreamily
at
him
to
begin
with
for
the
sake
of
being
russian
russian
conversations
on
such
subjects
are
always
carried
on
inconceivably
stupidly
and
secondly
the
stupider
one
is
the
closer
one
is
to
reality
the
stupider
one
is
the
clearer
one
is
stupidity
is
brief
and
artless
while
intelligence
wriggles
and
hides
itself
intelligence
is
a
knave
but
stupidity
is
honest
and
straightforward
i
ve
led
the
conversation
to
my
despair
and
the
more
stupidly
i
have
presented
it
the
better
for
me
you
will
explain
why
you
don
t
accept
the
world
said
alyosha
to
be
sure
i
will
it
s
not
a
secret
that
s
what
i
ve
been
leading
up
to
dear
little
brother
i
don
t
want
to
corrupt
you
or
to
turn
you
from
your
stronghold
perhaps
i
want
to
be
healed
by
you
ivan
smiled
suddenly
quite
like
a
little
gentle
child
alyosha
had
never
seen
such
a
smile
on
his
face
before
chapter
iv
rebellion
i
must
make
you
one
confession
ivan
began
i
could
never
understand
how
one
can
love
one
s
neighbors
it
s
just
one
s
neighbors
to
my
mind
that
one
can
t
love
though
one
might
love
those
at
a
distance
i
once
read
somewhere
of
john
the
merciful
a
saint
that
when
a
hungry
frozen
beggar
came
to
him
he
took
him
into
his
bed
held
him
in
his
arms
and
began
breathing
into
his
mouth
which
was
putrid
and
loathsome
from
some
awful
disease
i
am
convinced
that
he
did
that
from
self
laceration
from
the
self
laceration
of
falsity
for
the
sake
of
the
charity
imposed
by
duty
as
a
penance
laid
on
him
for
any
one
to
love
a
man
he
must
be
hidden
for
as
soon
as
he
shows
his
face
love
is
gone
father
zossima
has
talked
of
that
more
than
once
observed
alyosha
he
too
said
that
the
face
of
a
man
often
hinders
many
people
not
practiced
in
love
from
loving
him
but
yet
there
s
a
great
deal
of
love
in
mankind
and
almost
christ
like
love
i
know
that
myself
ivan
well
i
know
nothing
of
it
so
far
and
can
t
understand
it
and
the
innumerable
mass
of
mankind
are
with
me
there
the
question
is
whether
that
s
due
to
men
s
bad
qualities
or
whether
it
s
inherent
in
their
nature
to
my
thinking
christ
like
love
for
men
is
a
miracle
impossible
on
earth
he
was
god
but
we
are
not
gods
suppose
i
for
instance
suffer
intensely
another
can
never
know
how
much
i
suffer
because
he
is
another
and
not
i
and
what
s
more
a
man
is
rarely
ready
to
admit
another
s
suffering
as
though
it
were
a
distinction
why
won
t
he
admit
it
do
you
think
because
i
smell
unpleasant
because
i
have
a
stupid
face
because
i
once
trod
on
his
foot
besides
there
is
suffering
and
suffering
degrading
humiliating
suffering
such
as
humbles
me
hunger
for
instance
my
benefactor
will
perhaps
allow
me
but
when
you
come
to
higher
suffering
for
an
idea
for
instance
he
will
very
rarely
admit
that
perhaps
because
my
face
strikes
him
as
not
at
all
what
he
fancies
a
man
should
have
who
suffers
for
an
idea
and
so
he
deprives
me
instantly
of
his
favor
and
not
at
all
from
badness
of
heart
beggars
especially
genteel
beggars
ought
never
to
show
themselves
but
to
ask
for
charity
through
the
newspapers
one
can
love
one
s
neighbors
in
the
abstract
or
even
at
a
distance
but
at
close
quarters
it
s
almost
impossible
if
it
were
as
on
the
stage
in
the
ballet
where
if
beggars
come
in
they
wear
silken
rags
and
tattered
lace
and
beg
for
alms
dancing
gracefully
then
one
might
like
looking
at
them
but
even
then
we
should
not
love
them
but
enough
of
that
i
simply
wanted
to
show
you
my
point
of
view
i
meant
to
speak
of
the
suffering
of
mankind
generally
but
we
had
better
confine
ourselves
to
the
sufferings
of
the
children
that
reduces
the
scope
of
my
argument
to
a
tenth
of
what
it
would
be
still
we
d
better
keep
to
the
children
though
it
does
weaken
my
case
but
in
the
first
place
children
can
be
loved
even
at
close
quarters
even
when
they
are
dirty
even
when
they
are
ugly
i
fancy
though
children
never
are
ugly
the
second
reason
why
i
won
t
speak
of
grown
up
people
is
that
besides
being
disgusting
and
unworthy
of
love
they
have
a
compensation
they
ve
eaten
the
apple
and
know
good
and
evil
and
they
have
become
like
gods
they
go
on
eating
it
still
but
the
children
haven
t
eaten
anything
and
are
so
far
innocent
are
you
fond
of
children
alyosha
i
know
you
are
and
you
will
understand
why
i
prefer
to
speak
of
them
if
they
too
suffer
horribly
on
earth
they
must
suffer
for
their
fathers
sins
they
must
be
punished
for
their
fathers
who
have
eaten
the
apple
but
that
reasoning
is
of
the
other
world
and
is
incomprehensible
for
the
heart
of
man
here
on
earth
the
innocent
must
not
suffer
for
another
s
sins
and
especially
such
innocents
you
may
be
surprised
at
me
alyosha
but
i
am
awfully
fond
of
children
too
and
observe
cruel
people
the
violent
the
rapacious
the
karamazovs
are
sometimes
very
fond
of
children
children
while
they
are
quite
little
up
to
seven
for
instance
are
so
remote
from
grown
up
people
they
are
different
creatures
as
it
were
of
a
different
species
i
knew
a
criminal
in
prison
who
had
in
the
course
of
his
career
as
a
burglar
murdered
whole
families
including
several
children
but
when
he
was
in
prison
he
had
a
strange
affection
for
them
he
spent
all
his
time
at
his
window
watching
the
children
playing
in
the
prison
yard
he
trained
one
little
boy
to
come
up
to
his
window
and
made
great
friends
with
him
you
don
t
know
why
i
am
telling
you
all
this
alyosha
my
head
aches
and
i
am
sad
you
speak
with
a
strange
air
observed
alyosha
uneasily
as
though
you
were
not
quite
yourself
by
the
way
a
bulgarian
i
met
lately
in
moscow
ivan
went
on
seeming
not
to
hear
his
brother
s
words
told
me
about
the
crimes
committed
by
turks
and
circassians
in
all
parts
of
bulgaria
through
fear
of
a
general
rising
of
the
slavs
they
burn
villages
murder
outrage
women
and
children
they
nail
their
prisoners
by
the
ears
to
the
fences
leave
them
so
till
morning
and
in
the
morning
they
hang
them
all
sorts
of
things
you
can
t
imagine
people
talk
sometimes
of
bestial
cruelty
but
that
s
a
great
injustice
and
insult
to
the
beasts
a
beast
can
never
be
so
cruel
as
a
man
so
artistically
cruel
the
tiger
only
tears
and
gnaws
that
s
all
he
can
do
he
would
never
think
of
nailing
people
by
the
ears
even
if
he
were
able
to
do
it
these
turks
took
a
pleasure
in
torturing
children
too
cutting
the
unborn
child
from
the
mother
s
womb
and
tossing
babies
up
in
the
air
and
catching
them
on
the
points
of
their
bayonets
before
their
mothers
eyes
doing
it
before
the
mothers
eyes
was
what
gave
zest
to
the
amusement
here
is
another
scene
that
i
thought
very
interesting
imagine
a
trembling
mother
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
a
circle
of
invading
turks
around
her
they
ve
planned
a
diversion
they
pet
the
baby
laugh
to
make
it
laugh
they
succeed
the
baby
laughs
at
that
moment
a
turk
points
a
pistol
four
inches
from
the
baby
s
face
the
baby
laughs
with
glee
holds
out
its
little
hands
to
the
pistol
and
he
pulls
the
trigger
in
the
baby
s
face
and
blows
out
its
brains
artistic
wasn
t
it
by
the
way
turks
are
particularly
fond
of
sweet
things
they
say
brother
what
are
you
driving
at
asked
alyosha
i
think
if
the
devil
doesn
t
exist
but
man
has
created
him
he
has
created
him
in
his
own
image
and
likeness
just
as
he
did
god
then
observed
alyosha
it
s
wonderful
how
you
can
turn
words
as
polonius
says
in
hamlet
laughed
ivan
you
turn
my
words
against
me
well
i
am
glad
yours
must
be
a
fine
god
if
man
created
him
in
his
image
and
likeness
you
asked
just
now
what
i
was
driving
at
you
see
i
am
fond
of
collecting
certain
facts
and
would
you
believe
i
even
copy
anecdotes
of
a
certain
sort
from
newspapers
and
books
and
i
ve
already
got
a
fine
collection
the
turks
of
course
have
gone
into
it
but
they
are
foreigners
i
have
specimens
from
home
that
are
even
better
than
the
turks
you
know
we
prefer
beating
rods
and
scourges
that
s
our
national
institution
nailing
ears
is
unthinkable
for
us
for
we
are
after
all
europeans
but
the
rod
and
the
scourge
we
have
always
with
us
and
they
cannot
be
taken
from
us
abroad
now
they
scarcely
do
any
beating
manners
are
more
humane
or
laws
have
been
passed
so
that
they
don
t
dare
to
flog
men
now
but
they
make
up
for
it
in
another
way
just
as
national
as
ours
and
so
national
that
it
would
be
practically
impossible
among
us
though
i
believe
we
are
being
inoculated
with
it
since
the
religious
movement
began
in
our
aristocracy
i
have
a
charming
pamphlet
translated
from
the
french
describing
how
quite
recently
five
years
ago
a
murderer
richard
was
executed
a
young
man
i
believe
of
three
and
twenty
who
repented
and
was
converted
to
the
christian
faith
at
the
very
scaffold
this
richard
was
an
illegitimate
child
who
was
given
as
a
child
of
six
by
his
parents
to
some
shepherds
on
the
swiss
mountains
they
brought
him
up
to
work
for
them
he
grew
up
like
a
little
wild
beast
among
them
the
shepherds
taught
him
nothing
and
scarcely
fed
or
clothed
him
but
sent
him
out
at
seven
to
herd
the
flock
in
cold
and
wet
and
no
one
hesitated
or
scrupled
to
treat
him
so
quite
the
contrary
they
thought
they
had
every
right
for
richard
had
been
given
to
them
as
a
chattel
and
they
did
not
even
see
the
necessity
of
feeding
him
richard
himself
describes
how
in
those
years
like
the
prodigal
son
in
the
gospel
he
longed
to
eat
of
the
mash
given
to
the
pigs
which
were
fattened
for
sale
but
they
wouldn
t
even
give
him
that
and
beat
him
when
he
stole
from
the
pigs
and
that
was
how
he
spent
all
his
childhood
and
his
youth
till
he
grew
up
and
was
strong
enough
to
go
away
and
be
a
thief
the
savage
began
to
earn
his
living
as
a
day
laborer
in
geneva
he
drank
what
he
earned
he
lived
like
a
brute
and
finished
by
killing
and
robbing
an
old
man
he
was
caught
tried
and
condemned
to
death
they
are
not
sentimentalists
there
and
in
prison
he
was
immediately
surrounded
by
pastors
members
of
christian
brotherhoods
philanthropic
ladies
and
the
like
they
taught
him
to
read
and
write
in
prison
and
expounded
the
gospel
to
him
they
exhorted
him
worked
upon
him
drummed
at
him
incessantly
till
at
last
he
solemnly
confessed
his
crime
he
was
converted
he
wrote
to
the
court
himself
that
he
was
a
monster
but
that
in
the
end
god
had
vouchsafed
him
light
and
shown
grace
all
geneva
was
in
excitement
about
him
all
philanthropic
and
religious
geneva
all
the
aristocratic
and
well
bred
society
of
the
town
rushed
to
the
prison
kissed
richard
and
embraced
him
you
are
our
brother
you
have
found
grace
and
richard
does
nothing
but
weep
with
emotion
yes
i
ve
found
grace
all
my
youth
and
childhood
i
was
glad
of
pigs
food
but
now
even
i
have
found
grace
i
am
dying
in
the
lord
yes
richard
die
in
the
lord
you
have
shed
blood
and
must
die
though
it
s
not
your
fault
that
you
knew
not
the
lord
when
you
coveted
the
pigs
food
and
were
beaten
for
stealing
it
which
was
very
wrong
of
you
for
stealing
is
forbidden
but
you
ve
shed
blood
and
you
must
die
and
on
the
last
day
richard
perfectly
limp
did
nothing
but
cry
and
repeat
every
minute
this
is
my
happiest
day
i
am
going
to
the
lord
yes
cry
the
pastors
and
the
judges
and
philanthropic
ladies
this
is
the
happiest
day
of
your
life
for
you
are
going
to
the
lord
they
all
walk
or
drive
to
the
scaffold
in
procession
behind
the
prison
van
at
the
scaffold
they
call
to
richard
die
brother
die
in
the
lord
for
even
thou
hast
found
grace
and
so
covered
with
his
brothers
kisses
richard
is
dragged
on
to
the
scaffold
and
led
to
the
guillotine
and
they
chopped
off
his
head
in
brotherly
fashion
because
he
had
found
grace
yes
that
s
characteristic
that
pamphlet
is
translated
into
russian
by
some
russian
philanthropists
of
aristocratic
rank
and
evangelical
aspirations
and
has
been
distributed
gratis
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
people
the
case
of
richard
is
interesting
because
it
s
national
though
to
us
it
s
absurd
to
cut
off
a
man
s
head
because
he
has
become
our
brother
and
has
found
grace
yet
we
have
our
own
speciality
which
is
all
but
worse
our
historical
pastime
is
the
direct
satisfaction
of
inflicting
pain
there
are
lines
in
nekrassov
describing
how
a
peasant
lashes
a
horse
on
the
eyes
on
its
meek
eyes
every
one
must
have
seen
it
it
s
peculiarly
russian
he
describes
how
a
feeble
little
nag
has
foundered
under
too
heavy
a
load
and
cannot
move
the
peasant
beats
it
beats
it
savagely
beats
it
at
last
not
knowing
what
he
is
doing
in
the
intoxication
of
cruelty
thrashes
it
mercilessly
over
and
over
again
however
weak
you
are
you
must
pull
if
you
die
for
it
the
nag
strains
and
then
he
begins
lashing
the
poor
defenseless
creature
on
its
weeping
on
its
meek
eyes
the
frantic
beast
tugs
and
draws
the
load
trembling
all
over
gasping
for
breath
moving
sideways
with
a
sort
of
unnatural
spasmodic
action
it
s
awful
in
nekrassov
but
that
s
only
a
horse
and
god
has
given
horses
to
be
beaten
so
the
tatars
have
taught
us
and
they
left
us
the
knout
as
a
remembrance
of
it
but
men
too
can
be
beaten
a
well
educated
cultured
gentleman
and
his
wife
beat
their
own
child
with
a
birch
rod
a
girl
of
seven
i
have
an
exact
account
of
it
the
papa
was
glad
that
the
birch
was
covered
with
twigs
it
stings
more
said
he
and
so
he
began
stinging
his
daughter
i
know
for
a
fact
there
are
people
who
at
every
blow
are
worked
up
to
sensuality
to
literal
sensuality
which
increases
progressively
at
every
blow
they
inflict
they
beat
for
a
minute
for
five
minutes
for
ten
minutes
more
often
and
more
savagely
the
child
screams
at
last
the
child
cannot
scream
it
gasps
daddy
daddy
by
some
diabolical
unseemly
chance
the
case
was
brought
into
court
a
counsel
is
engaged
the
russian
people
have
long
called
a
barrister
a
conscience
for
hire
the
counsel
protests
in
his
client
s
defense
it
s
such
a
simple
thing
he
says
an
everyday
domestic
event
a
father
corrects
his
child
to
our
shame
be
it
said
it
is
brought
into
court
the
jury
convinced
by
him
give
a
favorable
verdict
the
public
roars
with
delight
that
the
torturer
is
acquitted
ah
pity
i
wasn
t
there
i
would
have
proposed
to
raise
a
subscription
in
his
honor
charming
pictures
but
i
ve
still
better
things
about
children
i
ve
collected
a
great
great
deal
about
russian
children
alyosha
there
was
a
little
girl
of
five
who
was
hated
by
her
father
and
mother
most
worthy
and
respectable
people
of
good
education
and
breeding
you
see
i
must
repeat
again
it
is
a
peculiar
characteristic
of
many
people
this
love
of
torturing
children
and
children
only
to
all
other
types
of
humanity
these
torturers
behave
mildly
and
benevolently
like
cultivated
and
humane
europeans
but
they
are
very
fond
of
tormenting
children
even
fond
of
children
themselves
in
that
sense
it
s
just
their
defenselessness
that
tempts
the
tormentor
just
the
angelic
confidence
of
the
child
who
has
no
refuge
and
no
appeal
that
sets
his
vile
blood
on
fire
in
every
man
of
course
a
demon
lies
hidden
the
demon
of
rage
the
demon
of
lustful
heat
at
the
screams
of
the
tortured
victim
the
demon
of
lawlessness
let
off
the
chain
the
demon
of
diseases
that
follow
on
vice
gout
kidney
disease
and
so
on
this
poor
child
of
five
was
subjected
to
every
possible
torture
by
those
cultivated
parents
they
beat
her
thrashed
her
kicked
her
for
no
reason
till
her
body
was
one
bruise
then
they
went
to
greater
refinements
of
cruelty
shut
her
up
all
night
in
the
cold
and
frost
in
a
privy
and
because
she
didn
t
ask
to
be
taken
up
at
night
as
though
a
child
of
five
sleeping
its
angelic
sound
sleep
could
be
trained
to
wake
and
ask
they
smeared
her
face
and
filled
her
mouth
with
excrement
and
it
was
her
mother
her
mother
did
this
and
that
mother
could
sleep
hearing
the
poor
child
s
groans
can
you
understand
why
a
little
creature
who
can
t
even
understand
what
s
done
to
her
should
beat
her
little
aching
heart
with
her
tiny
fist
in
the
dark
and
the
cold
and
weep
her
meek
unresentful
tears
to
dear
kind
god
to
protect
her
do
you
understand
that
friend
and
brother
you
pious
and
humble
novice
do
you
understand
why
this
infamy
must
be
and
is
permitted
without
it
i
am
told
man
could
not
have
existed
on
earth
for
he
could
not
have
known
good
and
evil
why
should
he
know
that
diabolical
good
and
evil
when
it
costs
so
much
why
the
whole
world
of
knowledge
is
not
worth
that
child
s
prayer
to
dear
kind
god
i
say
nothing
of
the
sufferings
of
grown
up
people
they
have
eaten
the
apple
damn
them
and
the
devil
take
them
all
but
these
little
ones
i
am
making
you
suffer
alyosha
you
are
not
yourself
i
ll
leave
off
if
you
like
never
mind
i
want
to
suffer
too
muttered
alyosha
one
picture
only
one
more
because
it
s
so
curious
so
characteristic
and
i
have
only
just
read
it
in
some
collection
of
russian
antiquities
i
ve
forgotten
the
name
i
must
look
it
up
it
was
in
the
darkest
days
of
serfdom
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
long
live
the
liberator
of
the
people
there
was
in
those
days
a
general
of
aristocratic
connections
the
owner
of
great
estates
one
of
those
men
somewhat
exceptional
i
believe
even
then
who
retiring
from
the
service
into
a
life
of
leisure
are
convinced
that
they
ve
earned
absolute
power
over
the
lives
of
their
subjects
there
were
such
men
then
so
our
general
settled
on
his
property
of
two
thousand
souls
lives
in
pomp
and
domineers
over
his
poor
neighbors
as
though
they
were
dependents
and
buffoons
he
has
kennels
of
hundreds
of
hounds
and
nearly
a
hundred
dog
boys
all
mounted
and
in
uniform
one
day
a
serf
boy
a
little
child
of
eight
threw
a
stone
in
play
and
hurt
the
paw
of
the
general
s
favorite
hound
why
is
my
favorite
dog
lame
he
is
told
that
the
boy
threw
a
stone
that
hurt
the
dog
s
paw
so
you
did
it
the
general
looked
the
child
up
and
down
take
him
he
was
taken
taken
from
his
mother
and
kept
shut
up
all
night
early
that
morning
the
general
comes
out
on
horseback
with
the
hounds
his
dependents
dog
boys
and
huntsmen
all
mounted
around
him
in
full
hunting
parade
the
servants
are
summoned
for
their
edification
and
in
front
of
them
all
stands
the
mother
of
the
child
the
child
is
brought
from
the
lock
up
it
s
a
gloomy
cold
foggy
autumn
day
a
capital
day
for
hunting
the
general
orders
the
child
to
be
undressed
the
child
is
stripped
naked
he
shivers
numb
with
terror
not
daring
to
cry
make
him
run
commands
the
general
run
run
shout
the
dog
boys
the
boy
runs
at
him
yells
the
general
and
he
sets
the
whole
pack
of
hounds
on
the
child
the
hounds
catch
him
and
tear
him
to
pieces
before
his
mother
s
eyes
i
believe
the
general
was
afterwards
declared
incapable
of
administering
his
estates
well
what
did
he
deserve
to
be
shot
to
be
shot
for
the
satisfaction
of
our
moral
feelings
speak
alyosha
to
be
shot
murmured
alyosha
lifting
his
eyes
to
ivan
with
a
pale
twisted
smile
bravo
cried
ivan
delighted
if
even
you
say
so
you
re
a
pretty
monk
so
there
is
a
little
devil
sitting
in
your
heart
alyosha
karamazov
what
i
said
was
absurd
but
that
s
just
the
point
that
but
cried
ivan
let
me
tell
you
novice
that
the
absurd
is
only
too
necessary
on
earth
the
world
stands
on
absurdities
and
perhaps
nothing
would
have
come
to
pass
in
it
without
them
we
know
what
we
know
what
do
you
know
i
understand
nothing
ivan
went
on
as
though
in
delirium
i
don
t
want
to
understand
anything
now
i
want
to
stick
to
the
fact
i
made
up
my
mind
long
ago
not
to
understand
if
i
try
to
understand
anything
i
shall
be
false
to
the
fact
and
i
have
determined
to
stick
to
the
fact
why
are
you
trying
me
alyosha
cried
with
sudden
distress
will
you
say
what
you
mean
at
last
of
course
i
will
that
s
what
i
ve
been
leading
up
to
you
are
dear
to
me
i
don
t
want
to
let
you
go
and
i
won
t
give
you
up
to
your
zossima
ivan
for
a
minute
was
silent
his
face
became
all
at
once
very
sad
listen
i
took
the
case
of
children
only
to
make
my
case
clearer
of
the
other
tears
of
humanity
with
which
the
earth
is
soaked
from
its
crust
to
its
center
i
will
say
nothing
i
have
narrowed
my
subject
on
purpose
i
am
a
bug
and
i
recognize
in
all
humility
that
i
cannot
understand
why
the
world
is
arranged
as
it
is
men
are
themselves
to
blame
i
suppose
they
were
given
paradise
they
wanted
freedom
and
stole
fire
from
heaven
though
they
knew
they
would
become
unhappy
so
there
is
no
need
to
pity
them
with
my
pitiful
earthly
euclidian
understanding
all
i
know
is
that
there
is
suffering
and
that
there
are
none
guilty
that
cause
follows
effect
simply
and
directly
that
everything
flows
and
finds
its
level
but
that
s
only
euclidian
nonsense
i
know
that
and
i
can
t
consent
to
live
by
it
what
comfort
is
it
to
me
that
there
are
none
guilty
and
that
cause
follows
effect
simply
and
directly
and
that
i
know
it
i
must
have
justice
or
i
will
destroy
myself
and
not
justice
in
some
remote
infinite
time
and
space
but
here
on
earth
and
that
i
could
see
myself
i
have
believed
in
it
i
want
to
see
it
and
if
i
am
dead
by
then
let
me
rise
again
for
if
it
all
happens
without
me
it
will
be
too
unfair
surely
i
haven
t
suffered
simply
that
i
my
crimes
and
my
sufferings
may
manure
the
soil
of
the
future
harmony
for
somebody
else
i
want
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
the
hind
lie
down
with
the
lion
and
the
victim
rise
up
and
embrace
his
murderer
i
want
to
be
there
when
every
one
suddenly
understands
what
it
has
all
been
for
all
the
religions
of
the
world
are
built
on
this
longing
and
i
am
a
believer
but
then
there
are
the
children
and
what
am
i
to
do
about
them
that
s
a
question
i
can
t
answer
for
the
hundredth
time
i
repeat
there
are
numbers
of
questions
but
i
ve
only
taken
the
children
because
in
their
case
what
i
mean
is
so
unanswerably
clear
listen
if
all
must
suffer
to
pay
for
the
eternal
harmony
what
have
children
to
do
with
it
tell
me
please
it
s
beyond
all
comprehension
why
they
should
suffer
and
why
they
should
pay
for
the
harmony
why
should
they
too
furnish
material
to
enrich
the
soil
for
the
harmony
of
the
future
i
understand
solidarity
in
sin
among
men
i
understand
solidarity
in
retribution
too
but
there
can
be
no
such
solidarity
with
children
and
if
it
is
really
true
that
they
must
share
responsibility
for
all
their
fathers
crimes
such
a
truth
is
not
of
this
world
and
is
beyond
my
comprehension
some
jester
will
say
perhaps
that
the
child
would
have
grown
up
and
have
sinned
but
you
see
he
didn
t
grow
up
he
was
torn
to
pieces
by
the
dogs
at
eight
years
old
oh
alyosha
i
am
not
blaspheming
i
understand
of
course
what
an
upheaval
of
the
universe
it
will
be
when
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
blends
in
one
hymn
of
praise
and
everything
that
lives
and
has
lived
cries
aloud
thou
art
just
o
lord
for
thy
ways
are
revealed
when
the
mother
embraces
the
fiend
who
threw
her
child
to
the
dogs
and
all
three
cry
aloud
with
tears
thou
art
just
o
lord
then
of
course
the
crown
of
knowledge
will
be
reached
and
all
will
be
made
clear
but
what
pulls
me
up
here
is
that
i
can
t
accept
that
harmony
and
while
i
am
on
earth
i
make
haste
to
take
my
own
measures
you
see
alyosha
perhaps
it
really
may
happen
that
if
i
live
to
that
moment
or
rise
again
to
see
it
i
too
perhaps
may
cry
aloud
with
the
rest
looking
at
the
mother
embracing
the
child
s
torturer
thou
art
just
o
lord
but
i
don
t
want
to
cry
aloud
then
while
there
is
still
time
i
hasten
to
protect
myself
and
so
i
renounce
the
higher
harmony
altogether
it
s
not
worth
the
tears
of
that
one
tortured
child
who
beat
itself
on
the
breast
with
its
little
fist
and
prayed
in
its
stinking
outhouse
with
its
unexpiated
tears
to
dear
kind
god
it
s
not
worth
it
because
those
tears
are
unatoned
for
they
must
be
atoned
for
or
there
can
be
no
harmony
but
how
how
are
you
going
to
atone
for
them
is
it
possible
by
their
being
avenged
but
what
do
i
care
for
avenging
them
what
do
i
care
for
a
hell
for
oppressors
what
good
can
hell
do
since
those
children
have
already
been
tortured
and
what
becomes
of
harmony
if
there
is
hell
i
want
to
forgive
i
want
to
embrace
i
don
t
want
more
suffering
and
if
the
sufferings
of
children
go
to
swell
the
sum
of
sufferings
which
was
necessary
to
pay
for
truth
then
i
protest
that
the
truth
is
not
worth
such
a
price
i
don
t
want
the
mother
to
embrace
the
oppressor
who
threw
her
son
to
the
dogs
she
dare
not
forgive
him
let
her
forgive
him
for
herself
if
she
will
let
her
forgive
the
torturer
for
the
immeasurable
suffering
of
her
mother
s
heart
but
the
sufferings
of
her
tortured
child
she
has
no
right
to
forgive
she
dare
not
forgive
the
torturer
even
if
the
child
were
to
forgive
him
and
if
that
is
so
if
they
dare
not
forgive
what
becomes
of
harmony
is
there
in
the
whole
world
a
being
who
would
have
the
right
to
forgive
and
could
forgive
i
don
t
want
harmony
from
love
for
humanity
i
don
t
want
it
i
would
rather
be
left
with
the
unavenged
suffering
i
would
rather
remain
with
my
unavenged
suffering
and
unsatisfied
indignation
even
if
i
were
wrong
besides
too
high
a
price
is
asked
for
harmony
it
s
beyond
our
means
to
pay
so
much
to
enter
on
it
and
so
i
hasten
to
give
back
my
entrance
ticket
and
if
i
am
an
honest
man
i
am
bound
to
give
it
back
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
i
am
doing
it
s
not
god
that
i
don
t
accept
alyosha
only
i
most
respectfully
return
him
the
ticket
that
s
rebellion
murmured
alyosha
looking
down
rebellion
i
am
sorry
you
call
it
that
said
ivan
earnestly
one
can
hardly
live
in
rebellion
and
i
want
to
live
tell
me
yourself
i
challenge
you
answer
imagine
that
you
are
creating
a
fabric
of
human
destiny
with
the
object
of
making
men
happy
in
the
end
giving
them
peace
and
rest
at
last
but
that
it
was
essential
and
inevitable
to
torture
to
death
only
one
tiny
creature
that
baby
beating
its
breast
with
its
fist
for
instance
and
to
found
that
edifice
on
its
unavenged
tears
would
you
consent
to
be
the
architect
on
those
conditions
tell
me
and
tell
the
truth
no
i
wouldn
t
consent
said
alyosha
softly
and
can
you
admit
the
idea
that
men
for
whom
you
are
building
it
would
agree
to
accept
their
happiness
on
the
foundation
of
the
unexpiated
blood
of
a
little
victim
and
accepting
it
would
remain
happy
for
ever
no
i
can
t
admit
it
brother
said
alyosha
suddenly
with
flashing
eyes
you
said
just
now
is
there
a
being
in
the
whole
world
who
would
have
the
right
to
forgive
and
could
forgive
but
there
is
a
being
and
he
can
forgive
everything
all
and
for
all
because
he
gave
his
innocent
blood
for
all
and
everything
you
have
forgotten
him
and
on
him
is
built
the
edifice
and
it
is
to
him
they
cry
aloud
thou
art
just
o
lord
for
thy
ways
are
revealed
ah
the
one
without
sin
and
his
blood
no
i
have
not
forgotten
him
on
the
contrary
i
ve
been
wondering
all
the
time
how
it
was
you
did
not
bring
him
in
before
for
usually
all
arguments
on
your
side
put
him
in
the
foreground
do
you
know
alyosha
don
t
laugh
i
made
a
poem
about
a
year
ago
if
you
can
waste
another
ten
minutes
on
me
i
ll
tell
it
to
you
you
wrote
a
poem
oh
no
i
didn
t
write
it
laughed
ivan
and
i
ve
never
written
two
lines
of
poetry
in
my
life
but
i
made
up
this
poem
in
prose
and
i
remembered
it
i
was
carried
away
when
i
made
it
up
you
will
be
my
first
reader
that
is
listener
why
should
an
author
forego
even
one
listener
smiled
ivan
shall
i
tell
it
to
you
i
am
all
attention
said
alyosha
my
poem
is
called
the
grand
inquisitor
it
s
a
ridiculous
thing
but
i
want
to
tell
it
to
you
chapter
v
the
grand
inquisitor
even
this
must
have
a
preface
that
is
a
literary
preface
laughed
ivan
and
i
am
a
poor
hand
at
making
one
you
see
my
action
takes
place
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
at
that
time
as
you
probably
learnt
at
school
it
was
customary
in
poetry
to
bring
down
heavenly
powers
on
earth
not
to
speak
of
dante
in
france
clerks
as
well
as
the
monks
in
the
monasteries
used
to
give
regular
performances
in
which
the
madonna
the
saints
the
angels
christ
and
god
himself
were
brought
on
the
stage
in
those
days
it
was
done
in
all
simplicity
in
victor
hugo
s
notre
dame
de
paris
an
edifying
and
gratuitous
spectacle
was
provided
for
the
people
in
the
h
tel
de
ville
of
paris
in
the
reign
of
louis
xi
in
honor
of
the
birth
of
the
dauphin
it
was
called
le
bon
jugement
de
la
tr
s
sainte
et
gracieuse
vierge
marie
and
she
appears
herself
on
the
stage
and
pronounces
her
bon
jugement
similar
plays
chiefly
from
the
old
testament
were
occasionally
performed
in
moscow
too
up
to
the
times
of
peter
the
great
but
besides
plays
there
were
all
sorts
of
legends
and
ballads
scattered
about
the
world
in
which
the
saints
and
angels
and
all
the
powers
of
heaven
took
part
when
required
in
our
monasteries
the
monks
busied
themselves
in
translating
copying
and
even
composing
such
poems
and
even
under
the
tatars
there
is
for
instance
one
such
poem
of
course
from
the
greek
the
wanderings
of
our
lady
through
hell
with
descriptions
as
bold
as
dante
s
our
lady
visits
hell
and
the
archangel
michael
leads
her
through
the
torments
she
sees
the
sinners
and
their
punishment
there
she
sees
among
others
one
noteworthy
set
of
sinners
in
a
burning
lake
some
of
them
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
so
that
they
can
t
swim
out
and
these
god
forgets
an
expression
of
extraordinary
depth
and
force
and
so
our
lady
shocked
and
weeping
falls
before
the
throne
of
god
and
begs
for
mercy
for
all
in
hell
for
all
she
has
seen
there
indiscriminately
her
conversation
with
god
is
immensely
interesting
she
beseeches
him
she
will
not
desist
and
when
god
points
to
the
hands
and
feet
of
her
son
nailed
to
the
cross
and
asks
how
can
i
forgive
his
tormentors
she
bids
all
the
saints
all
the
martyrs
all
the
angels
and
archangels
to
fall
down
with
her
and
pray
for
mercy
on
all
without
distinction
it
ends
by
her
winning
from
god
a
respite
of
suffering
every
year
from
good
friday
till
trinity
day
and
the
sinners
at
once
raise
a
cry
of
thankfulness
from
hell
chanting
thou
art
just
o
lord
in
this
judgment
well
my
poem
would
have
been
of
that
kind
if
it
had
appeared
at
that
time
he
comes
on
the
scene
in
my
poem
but
he
says
nothing
only
appears
and
passes
on
fifteen
centuries
have
passed
since
he
promised
to
come
in
his
glory
fifteen
centuries
since
his
prophet
wrote
behold
i
come
quickly
of
that
day
and
that
hour
knoweth
no
man
neither
the
son
but
the
father
as
he
himself
predicted
on
earth
but
humanity
awaits
him
with
the
same
faith
and
with
the
same
love
oh
with
greater
faith
for
it
is
fifteen
centuries
since
man
has
ceased
to
see
signs
from
heaven
no
signs
from
heaven
come
to
day
to
add
to
what
the
heart
doth
say
there
was
nothing
left
but
faith
in
what
the
heart
doth
say
it
is
true
there
were
many
miracles
in
those
days
there
were
saints
who
performed
miraculous
cures
some
holy
people
according
to
their
biographies
were
visited
by
the
queen
of
heaven
herself
but
the
devil
did
not
slumber
and
doubts
were
already
arising
among
men
of
the
truth
of
these
miracles
and
just
then
there
appeared
in
the
north
of
germany
a
terrible
new
heresy
a
huge
star
like
to
a
torch
that
is
to
a
church
fell
on
the
sources
of
the
waters
and
they
became
bitter
these
heretics
began
blasphemously
denying
miracles
but
those
who
remained
faithful
were
all
the
more
ardent
in
their
faith
the
tears
of
humanity
rose
up
to
him
as
before
awaited
his
coming
loved
him
hoped
for
him
yearned
to
suffer
and
die
for
him
as
before
and
so
many
ages
mankind
had
prayed
with
faith
and
fervor
o
lord
our
god
hasten
thy
coming
so
many
ages
called
upon
him
that
in
his
infinite
mercy
he
deigned
to
come
down
to
his
servants
before
that
day
he
had
come
down
he
had
visited
some
holy
men
martyrs
and
hermits
as
is
written
in
their
lives
among
us
tyutchev
with
absolute
faith
in
the
truth
of
his
words
bore
witness
that
bearing
the
cross
in
slavish
dress
weary
and
worn
the
heavenly
king
our
mother
russia
came
to
bless
and
through
our
land
went
wandering
and
that
certainly
was
so
i
assure
you
and
behold
he
deigned
to
appear
for
a
moment
to
the
people
to
the
tortured
suffering
people
sunk
in
iniquity
but
loving
him
like
children
my
story
is
laid
in
spain
in
seville
in
the
most
terrible
time
of
the
inquisition
when
fires
were
lighted
every
day
to
the
glory
of
god
and
in
the
splendid
auto
da
f
the
wicked
heretics
were
burnt
oh
of
course
this
was
not
the
coming
in
which
he
will
appear
according
to
his
promise
at
the
end
of
time
in
all
his
heavenly
glory
and
which
will
be
sudden
as
lightning
flashing
from
east
to
west
no
he
visited
his
children
only
for
a
moment
and
there
where
the
flames
were
crackling
round
the
heretics
in
his
infinite
mercy
he
came
once
more
among
men
in
that
human
shape
in
which
he
walked
among
men
for
three
years
fifteen
centuries
ago
he
came
down
to
the
hot
pavements
of
the
southern
town
in
which
on
the
day
before
almost
a
hundred
heretics
had
ad
majorem
gloriam
dei
been
burnt
by
the
cardinal
the
grand
inquisitor
in
a
magnificent
auto
da
f
in
the
presence
of
the
king
the
court
the
knights
the
cardinals
the
most
charming
ladies
of
the
court
and
the
whole
population
of
seville
he
came
softly
unobserved
and
yet
strange
to
say
every
one
recognized
him
that
might
be
one
of
the
best
passages
in
the
poem
i
mean
why
they
recognized
him
the
people
are
irresistibly
drawn
to
him
they
surround
him
they
flock
about
him
follow
him
he
moves
silently
in
their
midst
with
a
gentle
smile
of
infinite
compassion
the
sun
of
love
burns
in
his
heart
light
and
power
shine
from
his
eyes
and
their
radiance
shed
on
the
people
stirs
their
hearts
with
responsive
love
he
holds
out
his
hands
to
them
blesses
them
and
a
healing
virtue
comes
from
contact
with
him
even
with
his
garments
an
old
man
in
the
crowd
blind
from
childhood
cries
out
o
lord
heal
me
and
i
shall
see
thee
and
as
it
were
scales
fall
from
his
eyes
and
the
blind
man
sees
him
the
crowd
weeps
and
kisses
the
earth
under
his
feet
children
throw
flowers
before
him
sing
and
cry
hosannah
it
is
he
it
is
he
all
repeat
it
must
be
he
it
can
be
no
one
but
him
he
stops
at
the
steps
of
the
seville
cathedral
at
the
moment
when
the
weeping
mourners
are
bringing
in
a
little
open
white
coffin
in
it
lies
a
child
of
seven
the
only
daughter
of
a
prominent
citizen
the
dead
child
lies
hidden
in
flowers
he
will
raise
your
child
the
crowd
shouts
to
the
weeping
mother
the
priest
coming
to
meet
the
coffin
looks
perplexed
and
frowns
but
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
throws
herself
at
his
feet
with
a
wail
if
it
is
thou
raise
my
child
she
cries
holding
out
her
hands
to
him
the
procession
halts
the
coffin
is
laid
on
the
steps
at
his
feet
he
looks
with
compassion
and
his
lips
once
more
softly
pronounce
maiden
arise
and
the
maiden
arises
the
little
girl
sits
up
in
the
coffin
and
looks
round
smiling
with
wide
open
wondering
eyes
holding
a
bunch
of
white
roses
they
had
put
in
her
hand
there
are
cries
sobs
confusion
among
the
people
and
at
that
moment
the
cardinal
himself
the
grand
inquisitor
passes
by
the
cathedral
he
is
an
old
man
almost
ninety
tall
and
erect
with
a
withered
face
and
sunken
eyes
in
which
there
is
still
a
gleam
of
light
he
is
not
dressed
in
his
gorgeous
cardinal
s
robes
as
he
was
the
day
before
when
he
was
burning
the
enemies
of
the
roman
church
at
this
moment
he
is
wearing
his
coarse
old
monk
s
cassock
at
a
distance
behind
him
come
his
gloomy
assistants
and
slaves
and
the
holy
guard
he
stops
at
the
sight
of
the
crowd
and
watches
it
from
a
distance
he
sees
everything
he
sees
them
set
the
coffin
down
at
his
feet
sees
the
child
rise
up
and
his
face
darkens
he
knits
his
thick
gray
brows
and
his
eyes
gleam
with
a
sinister
fire
he
holds
out
his
finger
and
bids
the
guards
take
him
and
such
is
his
power
so
completely
are
the
people
cowed
into
submission
and
trembling
obedience
to
him
that
the
crowd
immediately
makes
way
for
the
guards
and
in
the
midst
of
deathlike
silence
they
lay
hands
on
him
and
lead
him
away
the
crowd
instantly
bows
down
to
the
earth
like
one
man
before
the
old
inquisitor
he
blesses
the
people
in
silence
and
passes
on
the
guards
lead
their
prisoner
to
the
close
gloomy
vaulted
prison
in
the
ancient
palace
of
the
holy
inquisition
and
shut
him
in
it
the
day
passes
and
is
followed
by
the
dark
burning
breathless
night
of
seville
the
air
is
fragrant
with
laurel
and
lemon
in
the
pitch
darkness
the
iron
door
of
the
prison
is
suddenly
opened
and
the
grand
inquisitor
himself
comes
in
with
a
light
in
his
hand
he
is
alone
the
door
is
closed
at
once
behind
him
he
stands
in
the
doorway
and
for
a
minute
or
two
gazes
into
his
face
at
last
he
goes
up
slowly
sets
the
light
on
the
table
and
speaks
is
it
thou
thou
but
receiving
no
answer
he
adds
at
once
don
t
answer
be
silent
what
canst
thou
say
indeed
i
know
too
well
what
thou
wouldst
say
and
thou
hast
no
right
to
add
anything
to
what
thou
hadst
said
of
old
why
then
art
thou
come
to
hinder
us
for
thou
hast
come
to
hinder
us
and
thou
knowest
that
but
dost
thou
know
what
will
be
to
morrow
i
know
not
who
thou
art
and
care
not
to
know
whether
it
is
thou
or
only
a
semblance
of
him
but
to
morrow
i
shall
condemn
thee
and
burn
thee
at
the
stake
as
the
worst
of
heretics
and
the
very
people
who
have
to
day
kissed
thy
feet
to
morrow
at
the
faintest
sign
from
me
will
rush
to
heap
up
the
embers
of
thy
fire
knowest
thou
that
yes
maybe
thou
knowest
it
he
added
with
thoughtful
penetration
never
for
a
moment
taking
his
eyes
off
the
prisoner
i
don
t
quite
understand
ivan
what
does
it
mean
alyosha
who
had
been
listening
in
silence
said
with
a
smile
is
it
simply
a
wild
fantasy
or
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
old
man
some
impossible
quiproquo
take
it
as
the
last
said
ivan
laughing
if
you
are
so
corrupted
by
modern
realism
and
can
t
stand
anything
fantastic
if
you
like
it
to
be
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
let
it
be
so
it
is
true
he
went
on
laughing
the
old
man
was
ninety
and
he
might
well
be
crazy
over
his
set
idea
he
might
have
been
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
prisoner
it
might
in
fact
be
simply
his
ravings
the
delusion
of
an
old
man
of
ninety
over
excited
by
the
auto
da
f
of
a
hundred
heretics
the
day
before
but
does
it
matter
to
us
after
all
whether
it
was
a
mistake
of
identity
or
a
wild
fantasy
all
that
matters
is
that
the
old
man
should
speak
out
should
speak
openly
of
what
he
has
thought
in
silence
for
ninety
years
and
the
prisoner
too
is
silent
does
he
look
at
him
and
not
say
a
word
that
s
inevitable
in
any
case
ivan
laughed
again
the
old
man
has
told
him
he
hasn
t
the
right
to
add
anything
to
what
he
has
said
of
old
one
may
say
it
is
the
most
fundamental
feature
of
roman
catholicism
in
my
opinion
at
least
all
has
been
given
by
thee
to
the
pope
they
say
and
all
therefore
is
still
in
the
pope
s
hands
and
there
is
no
need
for
thee
to
come
now
at
all
thou
must
not
meddle
for
the
time
at
least
that
s
how
they
speak
and
write
too
the
jesuits
at
any
rate
i
have
read
it
myself
in
the
works
of
their
theologians
hast
thou
the
right
to
reveal
to
us
one
of
the
mysteries
of
that
world
from
which
thou
hast
come
my
old
man
asks
him
and
answers
the
question
for
him
no
thou
hast
not
that
thou
mayest
not
add
to
what
has
been
said
of
old
and
mayest
not
take
from
men
the
freedom
which
thou
didst
exalt
when
thou
wast
on
earth
whatsoever
thou
revealest
anew
will
encroach
on
men
s
freedom
of
faith
for
it
will
be
manifest
as
a
miracle
and
the
freedom
of
their
faith
was
dearer
to
thee
than
anything
in
those
days
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
didst
thou
not
often
say
then
i
will
make
you
free
but
now
thou
hast
seen
these
free
men
the
old
man
adds
suddenly
with
a
pensive
smile
yes
we
ve
paid
dearly
for
it
he
goes
on
looking
sternly
at
him
but
at
last
we
have
completed
that
work
in
thy
name
for
fifteen
centuries
we
have
been
wrestling
with
thy
freedom
but
now
it
is
ended
and
over
for
good
dost
thou
not
believe
that
it
s
over
for
good
thou
lookest
meekly
at
me
and
deignest
not
even
to
be
wroth
with
me
but
let
me
tell
thee
that
now
to
day
people
are
more
persuaded
than
ever
that
they
have
perfect
freedom
yet
they
have
brought
their
freedom
to
us
and
laid
it
humbly
at
our
feet
but
that
has
been
our
doing
was
this
what
thou
didst
was
this
thy
freedom
i
don
t
understand
again
alyosha
broke
in
is
he
ironical
is
he
jesting
not
a
bit
of
it
he
claims
it
as
a
merit
for
himself
and
his
church
that
at
last
they
have
vanquished
freedom
and
have
done
so
to
make
men
happy
for
now
he
is
speaking
of
the
inquisition
of
course
for
the
first
time
it
has
become
possible
to
think
of
the
happiness
of
men
man
was
created
a
rebel
and
how
can
rebels
be
happy
thou
wast
warned
he
says
to
him
thou
hast
had
no
lack
of
admonitions
and
warnings
but
thou
didst
not
listen
to
those
warnings
thou
didst
reject
the
only
way
by
which
men
might
be
made
happy
but
fortunately
departing
thou
didst
hand
on
the
work
to
us
thou
hast
promised
thou
hast
established
by
thy
word
thou
hast
given
to
us
the
right
to
bind
and
to
unbind
and
now
of
course
thou
canst
not
think
of
taking
it
away
why
then
hast
thou
come
to
hinder
us
and
what
s
the
meaning
of
no
lack
of
admonitions
and
warnings
asked
alyosha
why
that
s
the
chief
part
of
what
the
old
man
must
say
the
wise
and
dread
spirit
the
spirit
of
self
destruction
and
non
existence
the
old
man
goes
on
the
great
spirit
talked
with
thee
in
the
wilderness
and
we
are
told
in
the
books
that
he
tempted
thee
is
that
so
and
could
anything
truer
be
said
than
what
he
revealed
to
thee
in
three
questions
and
what
thou
didst
reject
and
what
in
the
books
is
called
the
temptation
and
yet
if
there
has
ever
been
on
earth
a
real
stupendous
miracle
it
took
place
on
that
day
on
the
day
of
the
three
temptations
the
statement
of
those
three
questions
was
itself
the
miracle
if
it
were
possible
to
imagine
simply
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
those
three
questions
of
the
dread
spirit
had
perished
utterly
from
the
books
and
that
we
had
to
restore
them
and
to
invent
them
anew
and
to
do
so
had
gathered
together
all
the
wise
men
of
the
earth
rulers
chief
priests
learned
men
philosophers
poets
and
had
set
them
the
task
to
invent
three
questions
such
as
would
not
only
fit
the
occasion
but
express
in
three
words
three
human
phrases
the
whole
future
history
of
the
world
and
of
humanity
dost
thou
believe
that
all
the
wisdom
of
the
earth
united
could
have
invented
anything
in
depth
and
force
equal
to
the
three
questions
which
were
actually
put
to
thee
then
by
the
wise
and
mighty
spirit
in
the
wilderness
from
those
questions
alone
from
the
miracle
of
their
statement
we
can
see
that
we
have
here
to
do
not
with
the
fleeting
human
intelligence
but
with
the
absolute
and
eternal
for
in
those
three
questions
the
whole
subsequent
history
of
mankind
is
as
it
were
brought
together
into
one
whole
and
foretold
and
in
them
are
united
all
the
unsolved
historical
contradictions
of
human
nature
at
the
time
it
could
not
be
so
clear
since
the
future
was
unknown
but
now
that
fifteen
hundred
years
have
passed
we
see
that
everything
in
those
three
questions
was
so
justly
divined
and
foretold
and
has
been
so
truly
fulfilled
that
nothing
can
be
added
to
them
or
taken
from
them
judge
thyself
who
was
right
thou
or
he
who
questioned
thee
then
remember
the
first
question
its
meaning
in
other
words
was
this
thou
wouldst
go
into
the
world
and
art
going
with
empty
hands
with
some
promise
of
freedom
which
men
in
their
simplicity
and
their
natural
unruliness
cannot
even
understand
which
they
fear
and
dread
for
nothing
has
ever
been
more
insupportable
for
a
man
and
a
human
society
than
freedom
but
seest
thou
these
stones
in
this
parched
and
barren
wilderness
turn
them
into
bread
and
mankind
will
run
after
thee
like
a
flock
of
sheep
grateful
and
obedient
though
for
ever
trembling
lest
thou
withdraw
thy
hand
and
deny
them
thy
bread
but
thou
wouldst
not
deprive
man
of
freedom
and
didst
reject
the
offer
thinking
what
is
that
freedom
worth
if
obedience
is
bought
with
bread
thou
didst
reply
that
man
lives
not
by
bread
alone
but
dost
thou
know
that
for
the
sake
of
that
earthly
bread
the
spirit
of
the
earth
will
rise
up
against
thee
and
will
strive
with
thee
and
overcome
thee
and
all
will
follow
him
crying
who
can
compare
with
this
beast
he
has
given
us
fire
from
heaven
dost
thou
know
that
the
ages
will
pass
and
humanity
will
proclaim
by
the
lips
of
their
sages
that
there
is
no
crime
and
therefore
no
sin
there
is
only
hunger
feed
men
and
then
ask
of
them
virtue
that
s
what
they
ll
write
on
the
banner
which
they
will
raise
against
thee
and
with
which
they
will
destroy
thy
temple
where
thy
temple
stood
will
rise
a
new
building
the
terrible
tower
of
babel
will
be
built
again
and
though
like
the
one
of
old
it
will
not
be
finished
yet
thou
mightest
have
prevented
that
new
tower
and
have
cut
short
the
sufferings
of
men
for
a
thousand
years
for
they
will
come
back
to
us
after
a
thousand
years
of
agony
with
their
tower
they
will
seek
us
again
hidden
underground
in
the
catacombs
for
we
shall
be
again
persecuted
and
tortured
they
will
find
us
and
cry
to
us
feed
us
for
those
who
have
promised
us
fire
from
heaven
haven
t
given
it
and
then
we
shall
finish
building
their
tower
for
he
finishes
the
building
who
feeds
them
and
we
alone
shall
feed
them
in
thy
name
declaring
falsely
that
it
is
in
thy
name
oh
never
never
can
they
feed
themselves
without
us
no
science
will
give
them
bread
so
long
as
they
remain
free
in
the
end
they
will
lay
their
freedom
at
our
feet
and
say
to
us
make
us
your
slaves
but
feed
us
they
will
understand
themselves
at
last
that
freedom
and
bread
enough
for
all
are
inconceivable
together
for
never
never
will
they
be
able
to
share
between
them
they
will
be
convinced
too
that
they
can
never
be
free
for
they
are
weak
vicious
worthless
and
rebellious
thou
didst
promise
them
the
bread
of
heaven
but
i
repeat
again
can
it
compare
with
earthly
bread
in
the
eyes
of
the
weak
ever
sinful
and
ignoble
race
of
man
and
if
for
the
sake
of
the
bread
of
heaven
thousands
shall
follow
thee
what
is
to
become
of
the
millions
and
tens
of
thousands
of
millions
of
creatures
who
will
not
have
the
strength
to
forego
the
earthly
bread
for
the
sake
of
the
heavenly
or
dost
thou
care
only
for
the
tens
of
thousands
of
the
great
and
strong
while
the
millions
numerous
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
who
are
weak
but
love
thee
must
exist
only
for
the
sake
of
the
great
and
strong
no
we
care
for
the
weak
too
they
are
sinful
and
rebellious
but
in
the
end
they
too
will
become
obedient
they
will
marvel
at
us
and
look
on
us
as
gods
because
we
are
ready
to
endure
the
freedom
which
they
have
found
so
dreadful
and
to
rule
over
them
so
awful
it
will
seem
to
them
to
be
free
but
we
shall
tell
them
that
we
are
thy
servants
and
rule
them
in
thy
name
we
shall
deceive
them
again
for
we
will
not
let
thee
come
to
us
again
that
deception
will
be
our
suffering
for
we
shall
be
forced
to
lie
this
is
the
significance
of
the
first
question
in
the
wilderness
and
this
is
what
thou
hast
rejected
for
the
sake
of
that
freedom
which
thou
hast
exalted
above
everything
yet
in
this
question
lies
hid
the
great
secret
of
this
world
choosing
bread
thou
wouldst
have
satisfied
the
universal
and
everlasting
craving
of
humanity
to
find
some
one
to
worship
so
long
as
man
remains
free
he
strives
for
nothing
so
incessantly
and
so
painfully
as
to
find
some
one
to
worship
but
man
seeks
to
worship
what
is
established
beyond
dispute
so
that
all
men
would
agree
at
once
to
worship
it
for
these
pitiful
creatures
are
concerned
not
only
to
find
what
one
or
the
other
can
worship
but
to
find
something
that
all
would
believe
in
and
worship
what
is
essential
is
that
all
may
be
together
in
it
this
craving
for
community
of
worship
is
the
chief
misery
of
every
man
individually
and
of
all
humanity
from
the
beginning
of
time
for
the
sake
of
common
worship
they
ve
slain
each
other
with
the
sword
they
have
set
up
gods
and
challenged
one
another
put
away
your
gods
and
come
and
worship
ours
or
we
will
kill
you
and
your
gods
and
so
it
will
be
to
the
end
of
the
world
even
when
gods
disappear
from
the
earth
they
will
fall
down
before
idols
just
the
same
thou
didst
know
thou
couldst
not
but
have
known
this
fundamental
secret
of
human
nature
but
thou
didst
reject
the
one
infallible
banner
which
was
offered
thee
to
make
all
men
bow
down
to
thee
alone
the
banner
of
earthly
bread
and
thou
hast
rejected
it
for
the
sake
of
freedom
and
the
bread
of
heaven
behold
what
thou
didst
further
and
all
again
in
the
name
of
freedom
i
tell
thee
that
man
is
tormented
by
no
greater
anxiety
than
to
find
some
one
quickly
to
whom
he
can
hand
over
that
gift
of
freedom
with
which
the
ill
fated
creature
is
born
but
only
one
who
can
appease
their
conscience
can
take
over
their
freedom
in
bread
there
was
offered
thee
an
invincible
banner
give
bread
and
man
will
worship
thee
for
nothing
is
more
certain
than
bread
but
if
some
one
else
gains
possession
of
his
conscience
oh
then
he
will
cast
away
thy
bread
and
follow
after
him
who
has
ensnared
his
conscience
in
that
thou
wast
right
for
the
secret
of
man
s
being
is
not
only
to
live
but
to
have
something
to
live
for
without
a
stable
conception
of
the
object
of
life
man
would
not
consent
to
go
on
living
and
would
rather
destroy
himself
than
remain
on
earth
though
he
had
bread
in
abundance
that
is
true
but
what
happened
instead
of
taking
men
s
freedom
from
them
thou
didst
make
it
greater
than
ever
didst
thou
forget
that
man
prefers
peace
and
even
death
to
freedom
of
choice
in
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
nothing
is
more
seductive
for
man
than
his
freedom
of
conscience
but
nothing
is
a
greater
cause
of
suffering
and
behold
instead
of
giving
a
firm
foundation
for
setting
the
conscience
of
man
at
rest
for
ever
thou
didst
choose
all
that
is
exceptional
vague
and
enigmatic
thou
didst
choose
what
was
utterly
beyond
the
strength
of
men
acting
as
though
thou
didst
not
love
them
at
all
thou
who
didst
come
to
give
thy
life
for
them
instead
of
taking
possession
of
men
s
freedom
thou
didst
increase
it
and
burdened
the
spiritual
kingdom
of
mankind
with
its
sufferings
for
ever
thou
didst
desire
man
s
free
love
that
he
should
follow
thee
freely
enticed
and
taken
captive
by
thee
in
place
of
the
rigid
ancient
law
man
must
hereafter
with
free
heart
decide
for
himself
what
is
good
and
what
is
evil
having
only
thy
image
before
him
as
his
guide
but
didst
thou
not
know
that
he
would
at
last
reject
even
thy
image
and
thy
truth
if
he
is
weighed
down
with
the
fearful
burden
of
free
choice
they
will
cry
aloud
at
last
that
the
truth
is
not
in
thee
for
they
could
not
have
been
left
in
greater
confusion
and
suffering
than
thou
hast
caused
laying
upon
them
so
many
cares
and
unanswerable
problems
so
that
in
truth
thou
didst
thyself
lay
the
foundation
for
the
destruction
of
thy
kingdom
and
no
one
is
more
to
blame
for
it
yet
what
was
offered
thee
there
are
three
powers
three
powers
alone
able
to
conquer
and
to
hold
captive
for
ever
the
conscience
of
these
impotent
rebels
for
their
happiness
those
forces
are
miracle
mystery
and
authority
thou
hast
rejected
all
three
and
hast
set
the
example
for
doing
so
when
the
wise
and
dread
spirit
set
thee
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
said
to
thee
if
thou
wouldst
know
whether
thou
art
the
son
of
god
then
cast
thyself
down
for
it
is
written
the
angels
shall
hold
him
up
lest
he
fall
and
bruise
himself
and
thou
shalt
know
then
whether
thou
art
the
son
of
god
and
shalt
prove
then
how
great
is
thy
faith
in
thy
father
but
thou
didst
refuse
and
wouldst
not
cast
thyself
down
oh
of
course
thou
didst
proudly
and
well
like
god
but
the
weak
unruly
race
of
men
are
they
gods
oh
thou
didst
know
then
that
in
taking
one
step
in
making
one
movement
to
cast
thyself
down
thou
wouldst
be
tempting
god
and
have
lost
all
thy
faith
in
him
and
wouldst
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
against
that
earth
which
thou
didst
come
to
save
and
the
wise
spirit
that
tempted
thee
would
have
rejoiced
but
i
ask
again
are
there
many
like
thee
and
couldst
thou
believe
for
one
moment
that
men
too
could
face
such
a
temptation
is
the
nature
of
men
such
that
they
can
reject
miracle
and
at
the
great
moments
of
their
life
the
moments
of
their
deepest
most
agonizing
spiritual
difficulties
cling
only
to
the
free
verdict
of
the
heart
oh
thou
didst
know
that
thy
deed
would
be
recorded
in
books
would
be
handed
down
to
remote
times
and
the
utmost
ends
of
the
earth
and
thou
didst
hope
that
man
following
thee
would
cling
to
god
and
not
ask
for
a
miracle
but
thou
didst
not
know
that
when
man
rejects
miracle
he
rejects
god
too
for
man
seeks
not
so
much
god
as
the
miraculous
and
as
man
cannot
bear
to
be
without
the
miraculous
he
will
create
new
miracles
of
his
own
for
himself
and
will
worship
deeds
of
sorcery
and
witchcraft
though
he
might
be
a
hundred
times
over
a
rebel
heretic
and
infidel
thou
didst
not
come
down
from
the
cross
when
they
shouted
to
thee
mocking
and
reviling
thee
come
down
from
the
cross
and
we
will
believe
that
thou
art
he
thou
didst
not
come
down
for
again
thou
wouldst
not
enslave
man
by
a
miracle
and
didst
crave
faith
given
freely
not
based
on
miracle
thou
didst
crave
for
free
love
and
not
the
base
raptures
of
the
slave
before
the
might
that
has
overawed
him
for
ever
but
thou
didst
think
too
highly
of
men
therein
for
they
are
slaves
of
course
though
rebellious
by
nature
look
round
and
judge
fifteen
centuries
have
passed
look
upon
them
whom
hast
thou
raised
up
to
thyself
i
swear
man
is
weaker
and
baser
by
nature
than
thou
hast
believed
him
can
he
can
he
do
what
thou
didst
by
showing
him
so
much
respect
thou
didst
as
it
were
cease
to
feel
for
him
for
thou
didst
ask
far
too
much
from
him
thou
who
hast
loved
him
more
than
thyself
respecting
him
less
thou
wouldst
have
asked
less
of
him
that
would
have
been
more
like
love
for
his
burden
would
have
been
lighter
he
is
weak
and
vile
what
though
he
is
everywhere
now
rebelling
against
our
power
and
proud
of
his
rebellion
it
is
the
pride
of
a
child
and
a
schoolboy
they
are
little
children
rioting
and
barring
out
the
teacher
at
school
but
their
childish
delight
will
end
it
will
cost
them
dear
they
will
cast
down
temples
and
drench
the
earth
with
blood
but
they
will
see
at
last
the
foolish
children
that
though
they
are
rebels
they
are
impotent
rebels
unable
to
keep
up
their
own
rebellion
bathed
in
their
foolish
tears
they
will
recognize
at
last
that
he
who
created
them
rebels
must
have
meant
to
mock
at
them
they
will
say
this
in
despair
and
their
utterance
will
be
a
blasphemy
which
will
make
them
more
unhappy
still
for
man
s
nature
cannot
bear
blasphemy
and
in
the
end
always
avenges
it
on
itself
and
so
unrest
confusion
and
unhappiness
that
is
the
present
lot
of
man
after
thou
didst
bear
so
much
for
their
freedom
the
great
prophet
tells
in
vision
and
in
image
that
he
saw
all
those
who
took
part
in
the
first
resurrection
and
that
there
were
of
each
tribe
twelve
thousand
but
if
there
were
so
many
of
them
they
must
have
been
not
men
but
gods
they
had
borne
thy
cross
they
had
endured
scores
of
years
in
the
barren
hungry
wilderness
living
upon
locusts
and
roots
and
thou
mayest
indeed
point
with
pride
at
those
children
of
freedom
of
free
love
of
free
and
splendid
sacrifice
for
thy
name
but
remember
that
they
were
only
some
thousands
and
what
of
the
rest
and
how
are
the
other
weak
ones
to
blame
because
they
could
not
endure
what
the
strong
have
endured
how
is
the
weak
soul
to
blame
that
it
is
unable
to
receive
such
terrible
gifts
canst
thou
have
simply
come
to
the
elect
and
for
the
elect
but
if
so
it
is
a
mystery
and
we
cannot
understand
it
and
if
it
is
a
mystery
we
too
have
a
right
to
preach
a
mystery
and
to
teach
them
that
it
s
not
the
free
judgment
of
their
hearts
not
love
that
matters
but
a
mystery
which
they
must
follow
blindly
even
against
their
conscience
so
we
have
done
we
have
corrected
thy
work
and
have
founded
it
upon
miracle
mystery
and
authority
and
men
rejoiced
that
they
were
again
led
like
sheep
and
that
the
terrible
gift
that
had
brought
them
such
suffering
was
at
last
lifted
from
their
hearts
were
we
right
teaching
them
this
speak
did
we
not
love
mankind
so
meekly
acknowledging
their
feebleness
lovingly
lightening
their
burden
and
permitting
their
weak
nature
even
sin
with
our
sanction
why
hast
thou
come
now
to
hinder
us
and
why
dost
thou
look
silently
and
searchingly
at
me
with
thy
mild
eyes
be
angry
i
don
t
want
thy
love
for
i
love
thee
not
and
what
use
is
it
for
me
to
hide
anything
from
thee
don
t
i
know
to
whom
i
am
speaking
all
that
i
can
say
is
known
to
thee
already
and
is
it
for
me
to
conceal
from
thee
our
mystery
perhaps
it
is
thy
will
to
hear
it
from
my
lips
listen
then
we
are
not
working
with
thee
but
with
him
that
is
our
mystery
it
s
long
eight
centuries
since
we
have
been
on
his
side
and
not
on
thine
just
eight
centuries
ago
we
took
from
him
what
thou
didst
reject
with
scorn
that
last
gift
he
offered
thee
showing
thee
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
we
took
from
him
rome
and
the
sword
of
c
sar
and
proclaimed
ourselves
sole
rulers
of
the
earth
though
hitherto
we
have
not
been
able
to
complete
our
work
but
whose
fault
is
that
oh
the
work
is
only
beginning
but
it
has
begun
it
has
long
to
await
completion
and
the
earth
has
yet
much
to
suffer
but
we
shall
triumph
and
shall
be
c
sars
and
then
we
shall
plan
the
universal
happiness
of
man
but
thou
mightest
have
taken
even
then
the
sword
of
c
sar
why
didst
thou
reject
that
last
gift
hadst
thou
accepted
that
last
counsel
of
the
mighty
spirit
thou
wouldst
have
accomplished
all
that
man
seeks
on
earth
that
is
some
one
to
worship
some
one
to
keep
his
conscience
and
some
means
of
uniting
all
in
one
unanimous
and
harmonious
ant
heap
for
the
craving
for
universal
unity
is
the
third
and
last
anguish
of
men
mankind
as
a
whole
has
always
striven
to
organize
a
universal
state
there
have
been
many
great
nations
with
great
histories
but
the
more
highly
they
were
developed
the
more
unhappy
they
were
for
they
felt
more
acutely
than
other
people
the
craving
for
world
wide
union
the
great
conquerors
timours
and
ghenghis
khans
whirled
like
hurricanes
over
the
face
of
the
earth
striving
to
subdue
its
people
and
they
too
were
but
the
unconscious
expression
of
the
same
craving
for
universal
unity
hadst
thou
taken
the
world
and
c
sar
s
purple
thou
wouldst
have
founded
the
universal
state
and
have
given
universal
peace
for
who
can
rule
men
if
not
he
who
holds
their
conscience
and
their
bread
in
his
hands
we
have
taken
the
sword
of
c
sar
and
in
taking
it
of
course
have
rejected
thee
and
followed
him
oh
ages
are
yet
to
come
of
the
confusion
of
free
thought
of
their
science
and
cannibalism
for
having
begun
to
build
their
tower
of
babel
without
us
they
will
end
of
course
with
cannibalism
but
then
the
beast
will
crawl
to
us
and
lick
our
feet
and
spatter
them
with
tears
of
blood
and
we
shall
sit
upon
the
beast
and
raise
the
cup
and
on
it
will
be
written
mystery
but
then
and
only
then
the
reign
of
peace
and
happiness
will
come
for
men
thou
art
proud
of
thine
elect
but
thou
hast
only
the
elect
while
we
give
rest
to
all
and
besides
how
many
of
those
elect
those
mighty
ones
who
could
become
elect
have
grown
weary
waiting
for
thee
and
have
transferred
and
will
transfer
the
powers
of
their
spirit
and
the
warmth
of
their
heart
to
the
other
camp
and
end
by
raising
their
free
banner
against
thee
thou
didst
thyself
lift
up
that
banner
but
with
us
all
will
be
happy
and
will
no
more
rebel
nor
destroy
one
another
as
under
thy
freedom
oh
we
shall
persuade
them
that
they
will
only
become
free
when
they
renounce
their
freedom
to
us
and
submit
to
us
and
shall
we
be
right
or
shall
we
be
lying
they
will
be
convinced
that
we
are
right
for
they
will
remember
the
horrors
of
slavery
and
confusion
to
which
thy
freedom
brought
them
freedom
free
thought
and
science
will
lead
them
into
such
straits
and
will
bring
them
face
to
face
with
such
marvels
and
insoluble
mysteries
that
some
of
them
the
fierce
and
rebellious
will
destroy
themselves
others
rebellious
but
weak
will
destroy
one
another
while
the
rest
weak
and
unhappy
will
crawl
fawning
to
our
feet
and
whine
to
us
yes
you
were
right
you
alone
possess
his
mystery
and
we
come
back
to
you
save
us
from
ourselves
receiving
bread
from
us
they
will
see
clearly
that
we
take
the
bread
made
by
their
hands
from
them
to
give
it
to
them
without
any
miracle
they
will
see
that
we
do
not
change
the
stones
to
bread
but
in
truth
they
will
be
more
thankful
for
taking
it
from
our
hands
than
for
the
bread
itself
for
they
will
remember
only
too
well
that
in
old
days
without
our
help
even
the
bread
they
made
turned
to
stones
in
their
hands
while
since
they
have
come
back
to
us
the
very
stones
have
turned
to
bread
in
their
hands
too
too
well
will
they
know
the
value
of
complete
submission
and
until
men
know
that
they
will
be
unhappy
who
is
most
to
blame
for
their
not
knowing
it
speak
who
scattered
the
flock
and
sent
it
astray
on
unknown
paths
but
the
flock
will
come
together
again
and
will
submit
once
more
and
then
it
will
be
once
for
all
then
we
shall
give
them
the
quiet
humble
happiness
of
weak
creatures
such
as
they
are
by
nature
oh
we
shall
persuade
them
at
last
not
to
be
proud
for
thou
didst
lift
them
up
and
thereby
taught
them
to
be
proud
we
shall
show
them
that
they
are
weak
that
they
are
only
pitiful
children
but
that
childlike
happiness
is
the
sweetest
of
all
they
will
become
timid
and
will
look
to
us
and
huddle
close
to
us
in
fear
as
chicks
to
the
hen
they
will
marvel
at
us
and
will
be
awe
stricken
before
us
and
will
be
proud
at
our
being
so
powerful
and
clever
that
we
have
been
able
to
subdue
such
a
turbulent
flock
of
thousands
of
millions
they
will
tremble
impotently
before
our
wrath
their
minds
will
grow
fearful
they
will
be
quick
to
shed
tears
like
women
and
children
but
they
will
be
just
as
ready
at
a
sign
from
us
to
pass
to
laughter
and
rejoicing
to
happy
mirth
and
childish
song
yes
we
shall
set
them
to
work
but
in
their
leisure
hours
we
shall
make
their
life
like
a
child
s
game
with
children
s
songs
and
innocent
dance
oh
we
shall
allow
them
even
sin
they
are
weak
and
helpless
and
they
will
love
us
like
children
because
we
allow
them
to
sin
we
shall
tell
them
that
every
sin
will
be
expiated
if
it
is
done
with
our
permission
that
we
allow
them
to
sin
because
we
love
them
and
the
punishment
for
these
sins
we
take
upon
ourselves
and
we
shall
take
it
upon
ourselves
and
they
will
adore
us
as
their
saviors
who
have
taken
on
themselves
their
sins
before
god
and
they
will
have
no
secrets
from
us
we
shall
allow
or
forbid
them
to
live
with
their
wives
and
mistresses
to
have
or
not
to
have
children
according
to
whether
they
have
been
obedient
or
disobedient
and
they
will
submit
to
us
gladly
and
cheerfully
the
most
painful
secrets
of
their
conscience
all
all
they
will
bring
to
us
and
we
shall
have
an
answer
for
all
and
they
will
be
glad
to
believe
our
answer
for
it
will
save
them
from
the
great
anxiety
and
terrible
agony
they
endure
at
present
in
making
a
free
decision
for
themselves
and
all
will
be
happy
all
the
millions
of
creatures
except
the
hundred
thousand
who
rule
over
them
for
only
we
we
who
guard
the
mystery
shall
be
unhappy
there
will
be
thousands
of
millions
of
happy
babes
and
a
hundred
thousand
sufferers
who
have
taken
upon
themselves
the
curse
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
peacefully
they
will
die
peacefully
they
will
expire
in
thy
name
and
beyond
the
grave
they
will
find
nothing
but
death
but
we
shall
keep
the
secret
and
for
their
happiness
we
shall
allure
them
with
the
reward
of
heaven
and
eternity
though
if
there
were
anything
in
the
other
world
it
certainly
would
not
be
for
such
as
they
it
is
prophesied
that
thou
wilt
come
again
in
victory
thou
wilt
come
with
thy
chosen
the
proud
and
strong
but
we
will
say
that
they
have
only
saved
themselves
but
we
have
saved
all
we
are
told
that
the
harlot
who
sits
upon
the
beast
and
holds
in
her
hands
the
mystery
shall
be
put
to
shame
that
the
weak
will
rise
up
again
and
will
rend
her
royal
purple
and
will
strip
naked
her
loathsome
body
but
then
i
will
stand
up
and
point
out
to
thee
the
thousand
millions
of
happy
children
who
have
known
no
sin
and
we
who
have
taken
their
sins
upon
us
for
their
happiness
will
stand
up
before
thee
and
say
judge
us
if
thou
canst
and
darest
know
that
i
fear
thee
not
know
that
i
too
have
been
in
the
wilderness
i
too
have
lived
on
roots
and
locusts
i
too
prized
the
freedom
with
which
thou
hast
blessed
men
and
i
too
was
striving
to
stand
among
thy
elect
among
the
strong
and
powerful
thirsting
to
make
up
the
number
but
i
awakened
and
would
not
serve
madness
i
turned
back
and
joined
the
ranks
of
those
who
have
corrected
thy
work
i
left
the
proud
and
went
back
to
the
humble
for
the
happiness
of
the
humble
what
i
say
to
thee
will
come
to
pass
and
our
dominion
will
be
built
up
i
repeat
to
morrow
thou
shalt
see
that
obedient
flock
who
at
a
sign
from
me
will
hasten
to
heap
up
the
hot
cinders
about
the
pile
on
which
i
shall
burn
thee
for
coming
to
hinder
us
for
if
any
one
has
ever
deserved
our
fires
it
is
thou
to
morrow
i
shall
burn
thee

stopped
he
was
carried
away
as
he
talked
and
spoke
with
excitement
when
he
had
finished
he
suddenly
smiled
alyosha
had
listened
in
silence
towards
the
end
he
was
greatly
moved
and
seemed
several
times
on
the
point
of
interrupting
but
restrained
himself
now
his
words
came
with
a
rush
but
that
s
absurd
he
cried
flushing
your
poem
is
in
praise
of
jesus
not
in
blame
of
him
as
you
meant
it
to
be
and
who
will
believe
you
about
freedom
is
that
the
way
to
understand
it
that
s
not
the
idea
of
it
in
the
orthodox
church
that
s
rome
and
not
even
the
whole
of
rome
it
s
false
those
are
the
worst
of
the
catholics
the
inquisitors
the
jesuits
and
there
could
not
be
such
a
fantastic
creature
as
your
inquisitor
what
are
these
sins
of
mankind
they
take
on
themselves
who
are
these
keepers
of
the
mystery
who
have
taken
some
curse
upon
themselves
for
the
happiness
of
mankind
when
have
they
been
seen
we
know
the
jesuits
they
are
spoken
ill
of
but
surely
they
are
not
what
you
describe
they
are
not
that
at
all
not
at
all
they
are
simply
the
romish
army
for
the
earthly
sovereignty
of
the
world
in
the
future
with
the
pontiff
of
rome
for
emperor
that
s
their
ideal
but
there
s
no
sort
of
mystery
or
lofty
melancholy
about
it
it
s
simple
lust
of
power
of
filthy
earthly
gain
of
domination
something
like
a
universal
serfdom
with
them
as
masters
that
s
all
they
stand
for
they
don
t
even
believe
in
god
perhaps
your
suffering
inquisitor
is
a
mere
fantasy
stay
stay
laughed
ivan
how
hot
you
are
a
fantasy
you
say
let
it
be
so
of
course
it
s
a
fantasy
but
allow
me
to
say
do
you
really
think
that
the
roman
catholic
movement
of
the
last
centuries
is
actually
nothing
but
the
lust
of
power
of
filthy
earthly
gain
is
that
father
pa
ssy
s
teaching
no
no
on
the
contrary
father
pa
ssy
did
once
say
something
rather
the
same
as
you
but
of
course
it
s
not
the
same
not
a
bit
the
same
alyosha
hastily
corrected
himself
a
precious
admission
in
spite
of
your
not
a
bit
the
same
i
ask
you
why
your
jesuits
and
inquisitors
have
united
simply
for
vile
material
gain
why
can
there
not
be
among
them
one
martyr
oppressed
by
great
sorrow
and
loving
humanity
you
see
only
suppose
that
there
was
one
such
man
among
all
those
who
desire
nothing
but
filthy
material
gain
if
there
s
only
one
like
my
old
inquisitor
who
had
himself
eaten
roots
in
the
desert
and
made
frenzied
efforts
to
subdue
his
flesh
to
make
himself
free
and
perfect
but
yet
all
his
life
he
loved
humanity
and
suddenly
his
eyes
were
opened
and
he
saw
that
it
is
no
great
moral
blessedness
to
attain
perfection
and
freedom
if
at
the
same
time
one
gains
the
conviction
that
millions
of
god
s
creatures
have
been
created
as
a
mockery
that
they
will
never
be
capable
of
using
their
freedom
that
these
poor
rebels
can
never
turn
into
giants
to
complete
the
tower
that
it
was
not
for
such
geese
that
the
great
idealist
dreamt
his
dream
of
harmony
seeing
all
that
he
turned
back
and
joined
the
clever
people
surely
that
could
have
happened
joined
whom
what
clever
people
cried
alyosha
completely
carried
away
they
have
no
such
great
cleverness
and
no
mysteries
and
secrets
perhaps
nothing
but
atheism
that
s
all
their
secret
your
inquisitor
does
not
believe
in
god
that
s
his
secret
what
if
it
is
so
at
last
you
have
guessed
it
it
s
perfectly
true
it
s
true
that
that
s
the
whole
secret
but
isn
t
that
suffering
at
least
for
a
man
like
that
who
has
wasted
his
whole
life
in
the
desert
and
yet
could
not
shake
off
his
incurable
love
of
humanity
in
his
old
age
he
reached
the
clear
conviction
that
nothing
but
the
advice
of
the
great
dread
spirit
could
build
up
any
tolerable
sort
of
life
for
the
feeble
unruly
incomplete
empirical
creatures
created
in
jest
and
so
convinced
of
this
he
sees
that
he
must
follow
the
counsel
of
the
wise
spirit
the
dread
spirit
of
death
and
destruction
and
therefore
accept
lying
and
deception
and
lead
men
consciously
to
death
and
destruction
and
yet
deceive
them
all
the
way
so
that
they
may
not
notice
where
they
are
being
led
that
the
poor
blind
creatures
may
at
least
on
the
way
think
themselves
happy
and
note
the
deception
is
in
the
name
of
him
in
whose
ideal
the
old
man
had
so
fervently
believed
all
his
life
long
is
not
that
tragic
and
if
only
one
such
stood
at
the
head
of
the
whole
army
filled
with
the
lust
of
power
only
for
the
sake
of
filthy
gain
would
not
one
such
be
enough
to
make
a
tragedy
more
than
that
one
such
standing
at
the
head
is
enough
to
create
the
actual
leading
idea
of
the
roman
church
with
all
its
armies
and
jesuits
its
highest
idea
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
firmly
believe
that
there
has
always
been
such
a
man
among
those
who
stood
at
the
head
of
the
movement
who
knows
there
may
have
been
some
such
even
among
the
roman
popes
who
knows
perhaps
the
spirit
of
that
accursed
old
man
who
loves
mankind
so
obstinately
in
his
own
way
is
to
be
found
even
now
in
a
whole
multitude
of
such
old
men
existing
not
by
chance
but
by
agreement
as
a
secret
league
formed
long
ago
for
the
guarding
of
the
mystery
to
guard
it
from
the
weak
and
the
unhappy
so
as
to
make
them
happy
no
doubt
it
is
so
and
so
it
must
be
indeed
i
fancy
that
even
among
the
masons
there
s
something
of
the
same
mystery
at
the
bottom
and
that
that
s
why
the
catholics
so
detest
the
masons
as
their
rivals
breaking
up
the
unity
of
the
idea
while
it
is
so
essential
that
there
should
be
one
flock
and
one
shepherd
but
from
the
way
i
defend
my
idea
i
might
be
an
author
impatient
of
your
criticism
enough
of
it
you
are
perhaps
a
mason
yourself
broke
suddenly
from
alyosha
you
don
t
believe
in
god
he
added
speaking
this
time
very
sorrowfully
he
fancied
besides
that
his
brother
was
looking
at
him
ironically
how
does
your
poem
end
he
asked
suddenly
looking
down
or
was
it
the
end
i
meant
to
end
it
like
this
when
the
inquisitor
ceased
speaking
he
waited
some
time
for
his
prisoner
to
answer
him
his
silence
weighed
down
upon
him
he
saw
that
the
prisoner
had
listened
intently
all
the
time
looking
gently
in
his
face
and
evidently
not
wishing
to
reply
the
old
man
longed
for
him
to
say
something
however
bitter
and
terrible
but
he
suddenly
approached
the
old
man
in
silence
and
softly
kissed
him
on
his
bloodless
aged
lips
that
was
all
his
answer
the
old
man
shuddered
his
lips
moved
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
said
to
him
go
and
come
no
more
come
not
at
all
never
never
and
he
let
him
out
into
the
dark
alleys
of
the
town
the
prisoner
went
away
and
the
old
man
the
kiss
glows
in
his
heart
but
the
old
man
adheres
to
his
idea
and
you
with
him
you
too
cried
alyosha
mournfully
ivan
laughed
why
it
s
all
nonsense
alyosha
it
s
only
a
senseless
poem
of
a
senseless
student
who
could
never
write
two
lines
of
verse
why
do
you
take
it
so
seriously
surely
you
don
t
suppose
i
am
going
straight
off
to
the
jesuits
to
join
the
men
who
are
correcting
his
work
good
lord
it
s
no
business
of
mine
i
told
you
all
i
want
is
to
live
on
to
thirty
and
then
dash
the
cup
to
the
ground
but
the
little
sticky
leaves
and
the
precious
tombs
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
woman
you
love
how
will
you
live
how
will
you
love
them
alyosha
cried
sorrowfully
with
such
a
hell
in
your
heart
and
your
head
how
can
you
no
that
s
just
what
you
are
going
away
for
to
join
them
if
not
you
will
kill
yourself
you
can
t
endure
it
there
is
a
strength
to
endure
everything
ivan
said
with
a
cold
smile
what
strength
the
strength
of
the
karamazovs
the
strength
of
the
karamazov
baseness
to
sink
into
debauchery
to
stifle
your
soul
with
corruption
yes
possibly
even
that
only
perhaps
till
i
am
thirty
i
shall
escape
it
and
then
how
will
you
escape
it
by
what
will
you
escape
it
that
s
impossible
with
your
ideas
in
the
karamazov
way
again
everything
is
lawful
you
mean
everything
is
lawful
is
that
it
ivan
scowled
and
all
at
once
turned
strangely
pale
ah
you
ve
caught
up
yesterday
s
phrase
which
so
offended
mi
sov
and
which
dmitri
pounced
upon
so
na
vely
and
paraphrased
he
smiled
queerly
yes
if
you
like
everything
is
lawful
since
the
word
has
been
said
i
won
t
deny
it
and
mitya
s
version
isn
t
bad
alyosha
looked
at
him
in
silence
i
thought
that
going
away
from
here
i
have
you
at
least
ivan
said
suddenly
with
unexpected
feeling
but
now
i
see
that
there
is
no
place
for
me
even
in
your
heart
my
dear
hermit
the
formula
all
is
lawful
i
won
t
renounce
will
you
renounce
me
for
that
yes
alyosha
got
up
went
to
him
and
softly
kissed
him
on
the
lips
that
s
plagiarism
cried
ivan
highly
delighted
you
stole
that
from
my
poem
thank
you
though
get
up
alyosha
it
s
time
we
were
going
both
of
us
they
went
out
but
stopped
when
they
reached
the
entrance
of
the
restaurant
listen
alyosha
ivan
began
in
a
resolute
voice
if
i
am
really
able
to
care
for
the
sticky
little
leaves
i
shall
only
love
them
remembering
you
it
s
enough
for
me
that
you
are
somewhere
here
and
i
shan
t
lose
my
desire
for
life
yet
is
that
enough
for
you
take
it
as
a
declaration
of
love
if
you
like
and
now
you
go
to
the
right
and
i
to
the
left
and
it
s
enough
do
you
hear
enough
i
mean
even
if
i
don
t
go
away
to
morrow
i
think
i
certainly
shall
go
and
we
meet
again
don
t
say
a
word
more
on
these
subjects
i
beg
that
particularly
and
about
dmitri
too
i
ask
you
specially
never
speak
to
me
again
he
added
with
sudden
irritation
it
s
all
exhausted
it
has
all
been
said
over
and
over
again
hasn
t
it
and
i
ll
make
you
one
promise
in
return
for
it
when
at
thirty
i
want
to
dash
the
cup
to
the
ground
wherever
i
may
be
i
ll
come
to
have
one
more
talk
with
you
even
though
it
were
from
america
you
may
be
sure
of
that
i
ll
come
on
purpose
it
will
be
very
interesting
to
have
a
look
at
you
to
see
what
you
ll
be
by
that
time
it
s
rather
a
solemn
promise
you
see
and
we
really
may
be
parting
for
seven
years
or
ten
come
go
now
to
your
pater
seraphicus
he
is
dying
if
he
dies
without
you
you
will
be
angry
with
me
for
having
kept
you
good
by
kiss
me
once
more
that
s
right
now
go
ivan
turned
suddenly
and
went
his
way
without
looking
back
it
was
just
as
dmitri
had
left
alyosha
the
day
before
though
the
parting
had
been
very
different
the
strange
resemblance
flashed
like
an
arrow
through
alyosha
s
mind
in
the
distress
and
dejection
of
that
moment
he
waited
a
little
looking
after
his
brother
he
suddenly
noticed
that
ivan
swayed
as
he
walked
and
that
his
right
shoulder
looked
lower
than
his
left
he
had
never
noticed
it
before
but
all
at
once
he
turned
too
and
almost
ran
to
the
monastery
it
was
nearly
dark
and
he
felt
almost
frightened
something
new
was
growing
up
in
him
for
which
he
could
not
account
the
wind
had
risen
again
as
on
the
previous
evening
and
the
ancient
pines
murmured
gloomily
about
him
when
he
entered
the
hermitage
copse
he
almost
ran
pater
seraphicus
he
got
that
name
from
somewhere
where
from
alyosha
wondered
ivan
poor
ivan
and
when
shall
i
see
you
again
here
is
the
hermitage
yes
yes
that
he
is
pater
seraphicus
he
will
save
me
from
him
and
for
ever
several
times
afterwards
he
wondered
how
he
could
on
leaving
ivan
so
completely
forget
his
brother
dmitri
though
he
had
that
morning
only
a
few
hours
before
so
firmly
resolved
to
find
him
and
not
to
give
up
doing
so
even
should
he
be
unable
to
return
to
the
monastery
that
night
chapter
vi
for
awhile
a
very
obscure
one
and
ivan
on
parting
from
alyosha
went
home
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
s
house
but
strange
to
say
he
was
overcome
by
insufferable
depression
which
grew
greater
at
every
step
he
took
towards
the
house
there
was
nothing
strange
in
his
being
depressed
what
was
strange
was
that
ivan
could
not
have
said
what
was
the
cause
of
it
he
had
often
been
depressed
before
and
there
was
nothing
surprising
at
his
feeling
so
at
such
a
moment
when
he
had
broken
off
with
everything
that
had
brought
him
here
and
was
preparing
that
day
to
make
a
new
start
and
enter
upon
a
new
unknown
future
he
would
again
be
as
solitary
as
ever
and
though
he
had
great
hopes
and
great
too
great
expectations
from
life
he
could
not
have
given
any
definite
account
of
his
hopes
his
expectations
or
even
his
desires
yet
at
that
moment
though
the
apprehension
of
the
new
and
unknown
certainly
found
place
in
his
heart
what
was
worrying
him
was
something
quite
different
is
it
loathing
for
my
father
s
house
he
wondered
quite
likely
i
am
so
sick
of
it
and
though
it
s
the
last
time
i
shall
cross
its
hateful
threshold
still
i
loathe
it
no
it
s
not
that
either
is
it
the
parting
with
alyosha
and
the
conversation
i
had
with
him
for
so
many
years
i
ve
been
silent
with
the
whole
world
and
not
deigned
to
speak
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
reel
off
a
rigmarole
like
that
it
certainly
might
have
been
the
youthful
vexation
of
youthful
inexperience
and
vanity
vexation
at
having
failed
to
express
himself
especially
with
such
a
being
as
alyosha
on
whom
his
heart
had
certainly
been
reckoning
no
doubt
that
came
in
that
vexation
it
must
have
done
indeed
but
yet
that
was
not
it
that
was
not
it
either
i
feel
sick
with
depression
and
yet
i
can
t
tell
what
i
want
better
not
think
perhaps
ivan
tried
not
to
think
but
that
too
was
no
use
what
made
his
depression
so
vexatious
and
irritating
was
that
it
had
a
kind
of
casual
external
character
he
felt
that
some
person
or
thing
seemed
to
be
standing
out
somewhere
just
as
something
will
sometimes
obtrude
itself
upon
the
eye
and
though
one
may
be
so
busy
with
work
or
conversation
that
for
a
long
time
one
does
not
notice
it
yet
it
irritates
and
almost
torments
one
till
at
last
one
realizes
and
removes
the
offending
object
often
quite
a
trifling
and
ridiculous
one
some
article
left
about
in
the
wrong
place
a
handkerchief
on
the
floor
a
book
not
replaced
on
the
shelf
and
so
on
at
last
feeling
very
cross
and
ill
humored
ivan
arrived
home
and
suddenly
about
fifteen
paces
from
the
garden
gate
he
guessed
what
was
fretting
and
worrying
him
on
a
bench
in
the
gateway
the
valet
smerdyakov
was
sitting
enjoying
the
coolness
of
the
evening
and
at
the
first
glance
at
him
ivan
knew
that
the
valet
smerdyakov
was
on
his
mind
and
that
it
was
this
man
that
his
soul
loathed
it
all
dawned
upon
him
suddenly
and
became
clear
just
before
when
alyosha
had
been
telling
him
of
his
meeting
with
smerdyakov
he
had
felt
a
sudden
twinge
of
gloom
and
loathing
which
had
immediately
stirred
responsive
anger
in
his
heart
afterwards
as
he
talked
smerdyakov
had
been
forgotten
for
the
time
but
still
he
had
been
in
his
mind
and
as
soon
as
ivan
parted
with
alyosha
and
was
walking
home
the
forgotten
sensation
began
to
obtrude
itself
again
is
it
possible
that
a
miserable
contemptible
creature
like
that
can
worry
me
so
much
he
wondered
with
insufferable
irritation
it
was
true
that
ivan
had
come
of
late
to
feel
an
intense
dislike
for
the
man
especially
during
the
last
few
days
he
had
even
begun
to
notice
in
himself
a
growing
feeling
that
was
almost
of
hatred
for
the
creature
perhaps
this
hatred
was
accentuated
by
the
fact
that
when
ivan
first
came
to
the
neighborhood
he
had
felt
quite
differently
then
he
had
taken
a
marked
interest
in
smerdyakov
and
had
even
thought
him
very
original
he
had
encouraged
him
to
talk
to
him
although
he
had
always
wondered
at
a
certain
incoherence
or
rather
restlessness
in
his
mind
and
could
not
understand
what
it
was
that
so
continually
and
insistently
worked
upon
the
brain
of
the
contemplative
they
discussed
philosophical
questions
and
even
how
there
could
have
been
light
on
the
first
day
when
the
sun
moon
and
stars
were
only
created
on
the
fourth
day
and
how
that
was
to
be
understood
but
ivan
soon
saw
that
though
the
sun
moon
and
stars
might
be
an
interesting
subject
yet
that
it
was
quite
secondary
to
smerdyakov
and
that
he
was
looking
for
something
altogether
different
in
one
way
and
another
he
began
to
betray
a
boundless
vanity
and
a
wounded
vanity
too
and
that
ivan
disliked
it
had
first
given
rise
to
his
aversion
later
on
there
had
been
trouble
in
the
house
grushenka
had
come
on
the
scene
and
there
had
been
the
scandals
with
his
brother
dmitri
they
discussed
that
too
but
though
smerdyakov
always
talked
of
that
with
great
excitement
it
was
impossible
to
discover
what
he
desired
to
come
of
it
there
was
in
fact
something
surprising
in
the
illogicality
and
incoherence
of
some
of
his
desires
accidentally
betrayed
and
always
vaguely
expressed
smerdyakov
was
always
inquiring
putting
certain
indirect
but
obviously
premeditated
questions
but
what
his
object
was
he
did
not
explain
and
usually
at
the
most
important
moment
he
would
break
off
and
relapse
into
silence
or
pass
to
another
subject
but
what
finally
irritated
ivan
most
and
confirmed
his
dislike
for
him
was
the
peculiar
revolting
familiarity
which
smerdyakov
began
to
show
more
and
more
markedly
not
that
he
forgot
himself
and
was
rude
on
the
contrary
he
always
spoke
very
respectfully
yet
he
had
obviously
begun
to
consider
goodness
knows
why
that
there
was
some
sort
of
understanding
between
him
and
ivan
fyodorovitch
he
always
spoke
in
a
tone
that
suggested
that
those
two
had
some
kind
of
compact
some
secret
between
them
that
had
at
some
time
been
expressed
on
both
sides
only
known
to
them
and
beyond
the
comprehension
of
those
around
them
but
for
a
long
while
ivan
did
not
recognize
the
real
cause
of
his
growing
dislike
and
he
had
only
lately
realized
what
was
at
the
root
of
it
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
and
irritation
he
tried
to
pass
in
at
the
gate
without
speaking
or
looking
at
smerdyakov
but
smerdyakov
rose
from
the
bench
and
from
that
action
alone
ivan
knew
instantly
that
he
wanted
particularly
to
talk
to
him
ivan
looked
at
him
and
stopped
and
the
fact
that
he
did
stop
instead
of
passing
by
as
he
meant
to
the
minute
before
drove
him
to
fury
with
anger
and
repulsion
he
looked
at
smerdyakov
s
emasculate
sickly
face
with
the
little
curls
combed
forward
on
his
forehead
his
left
eye
winked
and
he
grinned
as
if
to
say
where
are
you
going
you
won
t
pass
by
you
see
that
we
two
clever
people
have
something
to
say
to
each
other
ivan
shook
get
away
miserable
idiot
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
but
to
his
profound
astonishment
he
heard
himself
say
is
my
father
still
asleep
or
has
he
waked
he
asked
the
question
softly
and
meekly
to
his
own
surprise
and
at
once
again
to
his
own
surprise
sat
down
on
the
bench
for
an
instant
he
felt
almost
frightened
he
remembered
it
afterwards
smerdyakov
stood
facing
him
his
hands
behind
his
back
looking
at
him
with
assurance
and
almost
severity
his
honor
is
still
asleep
he
articulated
deliberately
you
were
the
first
to
speak
not
i
he
seemed
to
say
i
am
surprised
at
you
sir
he
added
after
a
pause
dropping
his
eyes
affectedly
setting
his
right
foot
forward
and
playing
with
the
tip
of
his
polished
boot
why
are
you
surprised
at
me
ivan
asked
abruptly
and
sullenly
doing
his
utmost
to
restrain
himself
and
suddenly
realizing
with
disgust
that
he
was
feeling
intense
curiosity
and
would
not
on
any
account
have
gone
away
without
satisfying
it
why
don
t
you
go
to
tchermashnya
sir
smerdyakov
suddenly
raised
his
eyes
and
smiled
familiarly
why
i
smile
you
must
understand
of
yourself
if
you
are
a
clever
man
his
screwed
up
left
eye
seemed
to
say
why
should
i
go
to
tchermashnya
ivan
asked
in
surprise
smerdyakov
was
silent
again
fyodor
pavlovitch
himself
has
so
begged
you
to
he
said
at
last
slowly
and
apparently
attaching
no
significance
to
his
answer
i
put
you
off
with
a
secondary
reason
he
seemed
to
suggest
simply
to
say
something
damn
you
speak
out
what
you
want
ivan
cried
angrily
at
last
passing
from
meekness
to
violence
smerdyakov
drew
his
right
foot
up
to
his
left
pulled
himself
up
but
still
looked
at
him
with
the
same
serenity
and
the
same
little
smile
substantially
nothing
but
just
by
way
of
conversation
another
silence
followed
they
did
not
speak
for
nearly
a
minute
ivan
knew
that
he
ought
to
get
up
and
show
anger
and
smerdyakov
stood
before
him
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
as
though
to
see
whether
he
would
be
angry
or
not
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
ivan
at
last
he
moved
to
get
up
smerdyakov
seemed
to
seize
the
moment
i
m
in
an
awful
position
ivan
fyodorovitch
i
don
t
know
how
to
help
myself
he
said
resolutely
and
distinctly
and
at
his
last
word
he
sighed
ivan
fyodorovitch
sat
down
again
they
are
both
utterly
crazy
they
are
no
better
than
little
children
smerdyakov
went
on
i
am
speaking
of
your
parent
and
your
brother
dmitri
fyodorovitch
here
fyodor
pavlovitch
will
get
up
directly
and
begin
worrying
me
every
minute
has
she
come
why
hasn
t
she
come
and
so
on
up
till
midnight
and
even
after
midnight
and
if
agrafena
alexandrovna
doesn
t
come
for
very
likely
she
does
not
mean
to
come
at
all
then
he
will
be
at
me
again
to
morrow
morning
why
hasn
t
she
come
when
will
she
come
as
though
i
were
to
blame
for
it
on
the
other
side
it
s
no
better
as
soon
as
it
gets
dark
or
even
before
your
brother
will
appear
with
his
gun
in
his
hands
look
out
you
rogue
you
soup
maker
if
you
miss
her
and
don
t
let
me
know
she
s
been
i
ll
kill
you
before
any
one
when
the
night
s
over
in
the
morning
he
too
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
begins
worrying
me
to
death
why
hasn
t
she
come
will
she
come
soon
and
he
too
thinks
me
to
blame
because
his
lady
hasn
t
come
and
every
day
and
every
hour
they
get
angrier
and
angrier
so
that
i
sometimes
think
i
shall
kill
myself
in
a
fright
i
can
t
depend
upon
them
sir
and
why
have
you
meddled
why
did
you
begin
to
spy
for
dmitri
fyodorovitch
said
ivan
irritably
how
could
i
help
meddling
though
indeed
i
haven
t
meddled
at
all
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
i
kept
quiet
from
the
very
beginning
not
daring
to
answer
but
he
pitched
on
me
to
be
his
servant
he
has
had
only
one
thing
to
say
since
i
ll
kill
you
you
scoundrel
if
you
miss
her
i
feel
certain
sir
that
i
shall
have
a
long
fit
to
morrow
what
do
you
mean
by
a
long
fit
a
long
fit
lasting
a
long
time
several
hours
or
perhaps
a
day
or
two
once
it
went
on
for
three
days
i
fell
from
the
garret
that
time
the
struggling
ceased
and
then
began
again
and
for
three
days
i
couldn
t
come
back
to
my
senses
fyodor
pavlovitch
sent
for
herzenstube
the
doctor
here
and
he
put
ice
on
my
head
and
tried
another
remedy
too
i
might
have
died
but
they
say
one
can
t
tell
with
epilepsy
when
a
fit
is
coming
what
makes
you
say
you
will
have
one
to
morrow
ivan
inquired
with
a
peculiar
irritable
curiosity
that
s
just
so
you
can
t
tell
beforehand
besides
you
fell
from
the
garret
then
i
climb
up
to
the
garret
every
day
i
might
fall
from
the
garret
again
to
morrow
and
if
not
i
might
fall
down
the
cellar
steps
i
have
to
go
into
the
cellar
every
day
too
ivan
took
a
long
look
at
him
you
are
talking
nonsense
i
see
and
i
don
t
quite
understand
you
he
said
softly
but
with
a
sort
of
menace
do
you
mean
to
pretend
to
be
ill
to
morrow
for
three
days
eh
smerdyakov
who
was
looking
at
the
ground
again
and
playing
with
the
toe
of
his
right
foot
set
the
foot
down
moved
the
left
one
forward
and
grinning
articulated
if
i
were
able
to
play
such
a
trick
that
is
pretend
to
have
a
fit
and
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
a
man
accustomed
to
them
i
should
have
a
perfect
right
to
use
such
a
means
to
save
myself
from
death
for
even
if
agrafena
alexandrovna
comes
to
see
his
father
while
i
am
ill
his
honor
can
t
blame
a
sick
man
for
not
telling
him
he
d
be
ashamed
to
hang
it
all
ivan
cried
his
face
working
with
anger
why
are
you
always
in
such
a
funk
for
your
life
all
my
brother
dmitri
s
threats
are
only
hasty
words
and
mean
nothing
he
won
t
kill
you
it
s
not
you
he
ll
kill
he
d
kill
me
first
of
all
like
a
fly
but
even
more
than
that
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
taken
for
an
accomplice
of
his
when
he
does
something
crazy
to
his
father
why
should
you
be
taken
for
an
accomplice
they
ll
think
i
am
an
accomplice
because
i
let
him
know
the
signals
as
a
great
secret
what
signals
whom
did
you
tell
confound
you
speak
more
plainly
i
m
bound
to
admit
the
fact
smerdyakov
drawled
with
pedantic
composure
that
i
have
a
secret
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
this
business
as
you
know
yourself
if
only
you
do
know
it
he
has
for
several
days
past
locked
himself
in
as
soon
as
night
or
even
evening
comes
on
of
late
you
ve
been
going
upstairs
to
your
room
early
every
evening
and
yesterday
you
did
not
come
down
at
all
and
so
perhaps
you
don
t
know
how
carefully
he
has
begun
to
lock
himself
in
at
night
and
even
if
grigory
vassilyevitch
comes
to
the
door
he
won
t
open
to
him
till
he
hears
his
voice
but
grigory
vassilyevitch
does
not
come
because
i
wait
upon
him
alone
in
his
room
now
that
s
the
arrangement
he
made
himself
ever
since
this
to
do
with
agrafena
alexandrovna
began
but
at
night
by
his
orders
i
go
away
to
the
lodge
so
that
i
don
t
get
to
sleep
till
midnight
but
am
on
the
watch
getting
up
and
walking
about
the
yard
waiting
for
agrafena
alexandrovna
to
come
for
the
last
few
days
he
s
been
perfectly
frantic
expecting
her
what
he
argues
is
she
is
afraid
of
him
dmitri
fyodorovitch
mitya
as
he
calls
him
and
so
says
he
she
ll
come
the
back
way
late
at
night
to
me
you
look
out
for
her
says
he
till
midnight
and
later
and
if
she
does
come
you
run
up
and
knock
at
my
door
or
at
the
window
from
the
garden
knock
at
first
twice
rather
gently
and
then
three
times
more
quickly
then
says
he
i
shall
understand
at
once
that
she
has
come
and
will
open
the
door
to
you
quietly
another
signal
he
gave
me
in
case
anything
unexpected
happens
at
first
two
knocks
and
then
after
an
interval
another
much
louder
then
he
will
understand
that
something
has
happened
suddenly
and
that
i
must
see
him
and
he
will
open
to
me
so
that
i
can
go
and
speak
to
him
that
s
all
in
case
agrafena
alexandrovna
can
t
come
herself
but
sends
a
message
besides
dmitri
fyodorovitch
might
come
too
so
i
must
let
him
know
he
is
near
his
honor
is
awfully
afraid
of
dmitri
fyodorovitch
so
that
even
if
agrafena
alexandrovna
had
come
and
were
locked
in
with
him
and
dmitri
fyodorovitch
were
to
turn
up
anywhere
near
at
the
time
i
should
be
bound
to
let
him
know
at
once
knocking
three
times
so
that
the
first
signal
of
five
knocks
means
agrafena
alexandrovna
has
come
while
the
second
signal
of
three
knocks
means
something
important
to
tell
you
his
honor
has
shown
me
them
several
times
and
explained
them
and
as
in
the
whole
universe
no
one
knows
of
these
signals
but
myself
and
his
honor
so
he
d
open
the
door
without
the
slightest
hesitation
and
without
calling
out
he
is
awfully
afraid
of
calling
out
aloud
well
those
signals
are
known
to
dmitri
fyodorovitch
too
now
how
are
they
known
did
you
tell
him
how
dared
you
tell
him
it
was
through
fright
i
did
it
how
could
i
dare
to
keep
it
back
from
him
dmitri
fyodorovitch
kept
persisting
every
day
you
are
deceiving
me
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
i
ll
break
both
your
legs
for
you
so
i
told
him
those
secret
signals
that
he
might
see
my
slavish
devotion
and
might
be
satisfied
that
i
was
not
deceiving
him
but
was
telling
him
all
i
could
if
you
think
that
he
ll
make
use
of
those
signals
and
try
to
get
in
don
t
let
him
in
but
if
i
should
be
laid
up
with
a
fit
how
can
i
prevent
him
coming
in
then
even
if
i
dared
prevent
him
knowing
how
desperate
he
is
hang
it
how
can
you
be
so
sure
you
are
going
to
have
a
fit
confound
you
are
you
laughing
at
me
how
could
i
dare
laugh
at
you
i
am
in
no
laughing
humor
with
this
fear
on
me
i
feel
i
am
going
to
have
a
fit
i
have
a
presentiment
fright
alone
will
bring
it
on
confound
it
if
you
are
laid
up
grigory
will
be
on
the
watch
let
grigory
know
beforehand
he
will
be
sure
not
to
let
him
in
i
should
never
dare
to
tell
grigory
vassilyevitch
about
the
signals
without
orders
from
my
master
and
as
for
grigory
vassilyevitch
hearing
him
and
not
admitting
him
he
has
been
ill
ever
since
yesterday
and
marfa
ignatyevna
intends
to
give
him
medicine
to
morrow
they
ve
just
arranged
it
it
s
a
very
strange
remedy
of
hers
marfa
ignatyevna
knows
of
a
preparation
and
always
keeps
it
it
s
a
strong
thing
made
from
some
herb
she
has
the
secret
of
it
and
she
always
gives
it
to
grigory
vassilyevitch
three
times
a
year
when
his
lumbago
s
so
bad
he
is
almost
paralyzed
by
it
then
she
takes
a
towel
wets
it
with
the
stuff
and
rubs
his
whole
back
for
half
an
hour
till
it
s
quite
red
and
swollen
and
what
s
left
in
the
bottle
she
gives
him
to
drink
with
a
special
prayer
but
not
quite
all
for
on
such
occasions
she
leaves
some
for
herself
and
drinks
it
herself
and
as
they
never
take
strong
drink
i
assure
you
they
both
drop
asleep
at
once
and
sleep
sound
a
very
long
time
and
when
grigory
vassilyevitch
wakes
up
he
is
perfectly
well
after
it
but
marfa
ignatyevna
always
has
a
headache
from
it
so
if
marfa
ignatyevna
carries
out
her
intention
to
morrow
they
won
t
hear
anything
and
hinder
dmitri
fyodorovitch
they
ll
be
asleep
what
a
rigmarole
and
it
all
seems
to
happen
at
once
as
though
it
were
planned
you
ll
have
a
fit
and
they
ll
both
be
unconscious
cried
ivan
but
aren
t
you
trying
to
arrange
it
so
broke
from
him
suddenly
and
he
frowned
threateningly
