man
of
about
seventy
five
years
of

had
occupied

this

has
no
connection
whatever
with
the
real
substance
of
what

are
about
to
relate
it
will
not
be
superfluous
if
merely
for
the
sake
of
exactness
in
all
points
to
mention
here
the
various
rumors
and
remarks
which
had
been
in
circulation
about
him
from
the
very
moment
when
he
arrived
in
the
diocese
true
or
false
that
which
is
said
of
men
often
occupies
as
important
a
place
in
their
lives
and
above
all
in
their
destinies
as
that
which
they
do
m
myriel
was
the
son
of
a
councillor
of
the
parliament
of
aix
hence
he
belonged
to
the
nobility
of
the
bar
it
was
said
that
his
father
destining
him
to
be
the
heir
of
his
own
post
had
married
him
at
a
very
early
age
eighteen
or
twenty
in
accordance
with
a
custom
which
is
rather
widely
prevalent
in
parliamentary
families
in
spite
of
this
marriage
however
it
was
said
that
charles
myriel
created
a
great
deal
of
talk
he
was
well
formed
though
rather
short
in
stature
elegant
graceful
intelligent
the
whole
of
the
first
portion
of
his
life
had
been
devoted
to
the
world
and
to
gallantry
the
revolution
came
events
succeeded
each
other
with
precipitation
the
parliamentary
families
decimated
pursued
hunted
down
were
dispersed
m
charles
myriel
emigrated
to
italy
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
revolution
there
his
wife
died
of
a
malady
of
the
chest
from
which
she
had
long
suffered
he
had
no
children
what
took
place
next
in
the
fate
of
m
myriel
the
ruin
of
the
french
society
of
the
olden
days
the
fall
of
his
own
family
the
tragic
spectacles
of
93
which
were
perhaps
even
more
alarming
to
the
emigrants
who
viewed
them
from
a
distance
with
the
magnifying
powers
of
terror
did
these
cause
the
ideas
of
renunciation
and
solitude
to
germinate
in
him
was
he
in
the
midst
of
these
distractions
these
affections
which
absorbed
his
life
suddenly
smitten
with
one
of
those
mysterious
and
terrible
blows
which
sometimes
overwhelm
by
striking
to
his
heart
a
man
whom
public
catastrophes
would
not
shake
by
striking
at
his
existence
and
his
fortune
no
one
could
have
told
all
that
was
known
was
that
when
he
returned
from
italy
he
was
a
priest
in
1804
m
myriel
was
the
cure
of
b
brignolles
he
was
already
advanced
in
years
and
lived
in
a
very
retired
manner
about
the
epoch
of
the
coronation
some
petty
affair
connected
with
his
curacy
just
what
is
not
precisely
known

him
to

other
powerful
persons
to

he
went
to
solicit

parishioners

one
day
when
the
emperor
had
come
to
visit
his
uncle
the
worthy
cure
who
was
waiting
in

anteroom
found
himself
present
when
his
majesty
passed
napoleon
on
finding
himself
observed
with
a
certain
curiosity
by
this
old
man
turned
round
and
said
abruptly
who
is
this
good
man
who
is
staring
at
me
sire
said
m
myriel
you
are
looking
at
a
good
man
and
i
at
a
great
man
each
of
us
can
profit
by
it
that
very
evening
the
emperor
asked
the
cardinal
the
name
of
the
cure
and
some
time
afterwards
m
myriel
was
utterly
astonished
to
learn
that
he
had
been
appointed
bishop
of
d
what
truth
was
there
after
all
in
the
stories
which
were
invented
as
to
the
early
portion
of
m
myriel
s
life
no
one
knew
very
few
families
had
been
acquainted
with
the
myriel
family
before
the
revolution
m
myriel
had
to
undergo
the
fate
of
every
newcomer
in
a
little
town
where
there
are
many
mouths
which
talk
and
very
few
heads
which
think
he
was
obliged
to
undergo
it
although
he
was
a
bishop
and
because
he
was
a
bishop
but
after
all
the
rumors
with
which
his
name
was
connected
were
rumors
only
noise
sayings
words
less
than
words
palabres
as
the
energetic
language
of
the
south
expresses
it
however
that
may
be
after
nine
years
of
episcopal
power
and
of
residence
in
d
all
the
stories
and
subjects
of
conversation
which
engross
petty
towns
and
petty
people
at
the
outset
had
fallen
into
profound
oblivion
no
one
would
have
dared
to
mention
them
no
one
would
have
dared
to
recall
them
m
myriel
had
arrived
at

accompanied
by
an
elderly
spinster
mademoiselle
baptistine
who
was
his
sister
and
ten
years
his
junior
their
only
domestic
was
a
female
servant
of
the
same
age
as
mademoiselle
baptistine
and
named
madame
magloire
who
after
having
been
the
servant
of
m
le
cure
now
assumed
the
double
title
of
maid
to
mademoiselle
and
housekeeper
to
monseigneur
mademoiselle
baptistine
was
a
long
pale
thin
gentle
creature
she
realized
the
ideal
expressed
by
the
word
respectable
for
it
seems
that
a
woman
must
needs
be
a
mother
in
order
to
be
venerable
she
had
never
been
pretty
her
whole
life
which
had
been
nothing
but
a
succession
of
holy
deeds
had
finally
conferred
upon
her
a
sort
of
pallor
and
transparency
and
as
she
advanced
in
years
she
had
acquired
what
may
be
called
the
beauty
of
goodness
what
had
been
leanness
in
her
youth
had
become
transparency
in
her
maturity
and
this
diaphaneity
allowed
the
angel
to
be
seen
she
was
a
soul
rather
than
a
virgin
her
person
seemed
made
of
a
shadow
there
was
hardly
sufficient
body
to
provide
for
sex
a
little
matter
enclosing
a
light
large
eyes
forever
drooping
a
mere
pretext
for
a
soul

remaining
on

earth
madame
magloire
was
a
little
fat
white
old
woman
corpulent
and
bustling
always
out
of
breath
in
the
first
place
because
of
her
activity
and
in
the
next
because
of
her
asthma
on
his
arrival
m

was
installed
in

episcopal
palace
with
the
honors
required
by

imperial
decrees

immediately
after

this

was
a

everything
about

had
a
grand

the

the

the

the

which
was
very
large
with

encircling

the

was
a
low
and
narrow
building
of
a
single
story
with
a
small
garden
three
days
after
his
arrival
the
bishop
visited
the
hospital
the
visit
ended
he
had
the
director
requested
to
be
so
good
as
to
come
to
his
house
monsieur
the
director
of
the
hospital
said
he
to
him
how
many
sick
people
have
you
at
the
present
moment
twenty
six
monseigneur
that
was
the
number
which
i
counted
said
the
bishop
the
beds
pursued
the
director
are
very
much
crowded
against
each
other
that
is
what
i
observed
the
halls
are
nothing
but
rooms
and
it
is
with
difficulty
that
the
air
can
be
changed
in
them
so
it
seems
to
me
and
then
when
there
is
a
ray
of
sun
the
garden
is
very
small
for
the
convalescents
that
was
what
i
said
to
myself
in
case
of
epidemics
we
have
had
the
typhus
fever
this
year
we
had
the
sweating
sickness
two
years
ago
and
a
hundred
patients
at
times
we
know
not
what
to
do
that
is
the
thought
which
occurred
to
me
what
would
you
have
monseigneur
said
the
director
one
must
resign
one
s
self
this
conversation
took
place
in
the
gallery
dining
room
on
the
ground
floor
the
bishop
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
director
of
the
hospital
monsieur
said
he
how
many
beds
do
you
think
this
hall
alone
would
hold
monseigneur
s
dining
room
exclaimed
the
stupefied
director
the
bishop
cast
a
glance
round
the
apartment
and
seemed
to
be
taking
measures
and
calculations
with
his
eyes
it
would
hold
full
twenty
beds
said
he
as
though
speaking
to
himself
then
raising
his
voice
hold
monsieur
the
director
of
the
hospital
i
will
tell
you
something
there
is
evidently
a
mistake
here
there
are
thirty
six
of
you
in
five
or
six
small
rooms
there
are
three
of
us
here
and
we
have
room
for
sixty
there
is
some
mistake
i
tell
you
you
have
my
house
and
i
have
yours
give
me
back
my
house
you
are
at
home
here
on
the
following
day
the
thirty
six
patients
were
installed
in
the
bishop
s
palace
and
the
bishop
was
settled
in
the
hospital
m
myriel
had
no
property
his
family
having
been
ruined
by
the
revolution
his
sister
was
in
receipt
of
a
yearly
income
of
five
hundred
francs
which
sufficed
for
her
personal
wants
at

vicarage
m

received
from

a
salary
of
fifteen
thousand

on
the
very
day
when

took

been
seen

called
it
regulating

this
arrangement
was
accepted
with
absolute
submission
by
mademoiselle

this
holy
woman
regarded
monseigneur
of

as
at
one
and
the
same
time
her
brother
and
her
bishop
her
friend
according
to
the
flesh
and
her
superior
according
to
the
church
she
simply
loved
and
venerated
him
when
he
spoke
she
bowed
when
he
acted
she
yielded
her
adherence
their
only
servant
madame
magloire
grumbled
a
little
it
will
be
observed
that
monsieur
the
bishop
had
reserved
for
himself
only
one
thousand
livres
which
added
to
the
pension
of
mademoiselle
baptistine
made
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
on
these
fifteen
hundred
francs
these
two
old
women
and
the
old
man
subsisted
and
when
a
village
curate
came
to
d
the
bishop
still
found
means
to
entertain
him
thanks
to
the
severe
economy
of
madame
magloire
and
to
the
intelligent
administration
of
mademoiselle
baptistine
one
day
after
he
had
been
in
d
about
three
months
the
bishop
said
and
still
i
am
quite
cramped
with
it
all
i
should
think
so
exclaimed
madame
magloire
monseigneur
has
not
even
claimed
the
allowance
which
the
department
owes
him
for
the
expense
of
his
carriage
in
town
and
for
his
journeys
about
the
diocese
it
was
customary
for
bishops
in
former
days
hold
cried
the
bishop
you
are
quite
right
madame
magloire
and
he
made
his
demand
some
time
afterwards
the
general
council
took
this
demand
under
consideration
and
voted
him
an
annual
sum
of
three
thousand
francs
under
this
heading
allowance
to
m
the
bishop
for
expenses
of
carriage
expenses
of
posting
and
expenses
of
pastoral
visits
this
provoked
a
great
outcry
among
the
local
burgesses
and
a
senator
of
the
empire
a
former
member
of
the
council
of
the
five
hundred
which
favored
the
18
brumaire
and

of
public
worship
a
very
angry
and
confidential
note
on
the
subject
from
which
we
extract
these
authentic
lines
expenses
of
carriage
what
can
be
done
with
it
in
a
town
of
less
than
four
thousand
inhabitants
expenses
of
journeys
what
is
the
use
of
these
trips
in
the
first
place
next
how
can
the
posting
be
accomplished
in
these
mountainous
parts
there
are
no
roads
no
one
travels
otherwise
than
on
horseback
even
the
bridge
between
durance
and
chateau
arnoux
can
barely
support
ox
teams
these
priests
are
all
thus
greedy
and
avaricious
this
man
played
the
good
priest
when
he
first
came
now
he
does
like
the
rest
he
must
have
a
carriage
and
a
posting
chaise
he
must
have
luxuries
like
the
bishops
of
the
olden
days
oh
all
this
priesthood
things
will
not
go
well
m
le
comte
until
the
emperor
has
freed
us
from
these
black
capped
rascals
down
with
the
pope
matters
were
getting
embroiled
with
rome

for
my
part
i
am
for
caesar
alone
etc
etc
on
the
other
hand
this
affair
afforded
great
delight
to
madame
magloire
good
said
she
to
mademoiselle
baptistine
monseigneur
began
with
other
people
but
he
has
had
to
wind
up
with
himself
after
all
he
has
regulated
all
his
charities
now
here
are
three
thousand
francs
for
us
at
last
that
same
evening
the
bishop
wrote
out
and
handed
to
his
sister
a
memorandum
conceived
in
the
following
terms
expenses
of
carriage
and
circuit
for
furnishing
meat
soup
to
the
patients
in
the
hospital
1
500

for

for

3
000
such

for

episcopal
perquisites
the
fees
for
marriage
bans
dispensations
private
baptisms
sermons
benedictions
of
churches
or
chapels
marriages
etc
the
bishop
levied
them
on
the
wealthy
with
all
the
more
asperity
since
he
bestowed
them
on
the
needy
after
a
time
offerings
of
money
flowed
in
those
who
had
and
those
who
lacked
knocked
at
m
myriel
s
door
the
latter
in
search
of
the
alms
which
the
former
came
to
deposit
in
less
than
a
year
the
bishop
had
become
the
treasurer
of
all
benevolence
and
the
cashier
of
all
those
in
distress
considerable
sums
of
money
passed
through
his
hands
but
nothing
could
induce
him
to
make
any
change
whatever
in
his
mode
of
life
or
add
anything
superfluous
to
his
bare
necessities
far
from
it
as
there
is
always
more
wretchedness
below
than
there
is
brotherhood
above
all
was
given
away
so
to
speak
before
it
was
received
it
was
like
water
on
dry
soil
no
matter
how
much
money
he
received
he
never
had
any
then
he
stripped
himself
the
usage
being
that
bishops
shall
announce
their
baptismal
names
at
the
head
of
their
charges
and
their
pastoral
letters
the
poor
people
of
the
country
side
had
selected
with
a
sort
of
affectionate
instinct
among
the
names
and
prenomens
of
their
bishop
that
which
had
a
meaning
for
them
and
they
never
called
him
anything
except
monseigneur
bienvenu
welcome
we
will
follow
their
example
and
will
also
call
him
thus
when
we
have
occasion
to
name
him
moreover
this
appellation
pleased
him
i
like
that
name
said
he
bienvenu
makes
up
for
the
monseigneur
we
do
not
claim
that
the
portrait
herewith
presented
is
probable
we
confine
ourselves
to
stating
that
it
resembles
the
original
chapter
iii
a
hard
bishopric
for
a
good
bishop
the
bishop
did
not
omit
his
pastoral
visits
because
he
had
converted
his
carriage
into
alms
the
diocese
of
d
is
a
fatiguing
one
there
are
very
few
plains
and
a
great
many
mountains
hardly
any
roads
as
we
have
just
seen
thirty
two
curacies
forty
one
vicarships
and
two
hundred
and
eighty
five
auxiliary
chapels
to
visit
all
these
is
quite
a
task
the
bishop
managed
to
do
it
he
went
on
foot
when
it
was
in
the
neighborhood
in
a
tilted
spring
cart
when
it
was
on
the
plain
and
on
a
donkey
in
the
mountains
the
two
old
women
accompanied
him
when
the
trip
was
too
hard
for
them
he
went
alone
one
day
he
arrived
at
senez
which
is
an
ancient
episcopal
city
he
was
mounted
on
an
ass
his
purse
which
was
very
dry
at
that
moment
did
not
permit
him
any
other
equipage
the
mayor
of
the
town
came
to
receive
him
at
the
gate
of
the
town
and
watched
him
dismount
from
his
ass
with
scandalized
eyes
some
of
the
citizens
were
laughing
around
him
monsieur
the
mayor
said
the
bishop
and
messieurs
citizens
i
perceive
that
i
shock
you
you
think
it
very
arrogant
in
a
poor
priest
to
ride
an
animal
which
was
used
by
jesus
christ
i
have
done
so
from
necessity
i
assure
you
and
not
from
vanity
in
the
course
of
these
trips
he
was
kind
and
indulgent
and
talked
rather
than
preached
he
never
went
far
in
search
of
his
arguments
and
his
examples
he
quoted
to
the
inhabitants
of
one
district
the
example
of
a
neighboring
district
in
the
cantons
where
they
were
harsh
to
the
poor
he
said
look
at
the
people
of
briancon
they
have
conferred
on
the
poor
on
widows
and
orphans
the
right
to
have
their
meadows
mown
three
days
in
advance
of
every
one
else
they
rebuild
their
houses
for
them
gratuitously
when
they
are
ruined
therefore
it
is
a
country
which
is
blessed
by
god
for
a
whole
century
there
has
not
been
a
single
murderer
among
them
in
villages
which
were
greedy
for
profit
and
harvest
he
said
look
at
the
people
of
embrun
if
at
the
harvest
season
the
father
of
a
family
has
his
son
away
on
service
in
the
army
and
his
daughters
at
service
in
the
town
and
if
he
is
ill
and
incapacitated
the
cure
recommends
him
to
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
and
on
sunday
after
the
mass
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
men
women
and
children
go
to
the
poor
man
s
field
and
do
his
harvesting
for
him
and
carry
his
straw
and
his
grain
to
his
granary
to
families
divided
by
questions
of
money
and
inheritance
he
said
look
at
the
mountaineers
of
devolny
a
country
so
wild
that
the
nightingale
is
not
heard
there
once
in
fifty
years
well
when
the
father
of
a
family
dies
the
boys
go
off
to
seek
their
fortunes
leaving
the
property
to
the
girls
so
that
they
may
find
husbands
to
the
cantons
which
had
a
taste
for
lawsuits
and
where
the
farmers
ruined
themselves
in
stamped
paper
he
said
look
at
those
good
peasants
in
the
valley
of
queyras
there
are
three
thousand
souls
of
them
mon
dieu
it
is
like
a
little
republic
neither
judge
nor
bailiff
is
known
there
the
mayor
does
everything
he
allots
the
imposts
taxes
each
person
conscientiously
judges
quarrels
for
nothing
divides
inheritances
without
charge
pronounces
sentences
gratuitously
and
he
is
obeyed
because
he
is
a
just
man
among
simple
men
to
villages
where
he
found
no
schoolmaster
he
quoted
once
more
the
people
of
queyras
do
you
know
how
they
manage
he
said
since
a
little
country
of
a
dozen
or
fifteen
hearths
cannot
always
support
a
teacher
they
have
school
masters
who
are
paid
by
the
whole
valley
who
make
the
round
of
the
villages
spending
a
week
in
this
one
ten
days
in
that
and
instruct
them
these
teachers
go
to
the
fairs
i
have
seen
them
there
they
are
to
be
recognized
by
the
quill
pens
which
they
wear
in
the
cord
of
their
hat
those
who
teach
reading
only
have
one
pen
those
who
teach
reading
and
reckoning
have
two
pens
those
who
teach
reading
reckoning
and
latin
have
three
pens
but
what
a
disgrace
to
be
ignorant
do
like
the
people
of
queyras
thus
he
discoursed
gravely
and
paternally
in
default
of
examples
he
invented
parables
going
directly
to
the
point
with
few
phrases
and
many
images
which
characteristic
formed
the
real
eloquence
of
jesus
christ
and
being
convinced
himself
he
was
persuasive
chapter
iv
works
corresponding
to
words
his
conversation
was
gay
and
affable
he
put
himself
on
a
level
with
the
two
old
women
who
had
passed
their
lives
beside
him
when
he
laughed
it
was
the
laugh
of
a
schoolboy
madame
magloire
liked
to
call
him
your
grace
votre
grandeur
one
day
he
rose
from
his
arm
chair
and
went
to
his
library
in
search
of
a
book
this
book
was
on
one
of
the
upper
shelves
as
the
bishop
was
rather
short
of
stature
he
could
not
reach
it
madame
magloire
said
he
fetch
me
a
chair
my
greatness
grandeur
does
not
reach
as
far
as
that
shelf
one
of
his
distant
relatives
madame
la
comtesse
de
lo
rarely
allowed
an
opportunity
to
escape
of
enumerating
in
his
presence
what
she
designated
as
the
expectations
of
her
three
sons
she
had
numerous
relatives
who
were
very
old
and
near
to
death
and
of
whom
her
sons
were
the
natural
heirs
the
youngest
of
the
three
was
to
receive
from
a
grand
aunt
a
good
hundred
thousand
livres
of
income
the
second
was
the
heir
by
entail
to
the
title
of
the
duke
his
uncle
the
eldest
was
to
succeed
to
the
peerage
of
his
grandfather
the
bishop
was
accustomed
to
listen
in
silence
to
these
innocent
and
pardonable
maternal
boasts
on
one
occasion
however
he
appeared
to
be
more
thoughtful
than
usual
while
madame
de
lo
was
relating
once
again
the
details
of
all
these
inheritances
and
all
these
expectations
she
interrupted
herself
impatiently
mon
dieu
cousin
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
am
thinking
replied
the
bishop
of
a
singular
remark
which
is
to
be
found
i
believe
in
st
augustine
place
your
hopes
in
the
man
from
whom
you
do
not
inherit
at
another
time
on
receiving
a
notification
of
the
decease
of
a
gentleman
of
the
country
side
wherein
not
only
the
dignities
of
the
dead
man
but
also
the
feudal
and
noble
qualifications
of
all
his
relatives
spread
over
an
entire
page
what
a
stout
back
death
has
he
exclaimed
what
a
strange
burden
of
titles
is
cheerfully
imposed
on
him
and
how
much
wit
must
men
have
in
order
thus
to
press
the
tomb
into
the
service
of
vanity
he
was
gifted
on
occasion
with
a
gentle
raillery
which
almost
always
concealed
a
serious
meaning
in
the
course
of
one
lent
a
youthful
vicar
came
to
d
and
preached
in
the
cathedral
he
was
tolerably
eloquent
the
subject
of
his
sermon
was
charity
he
urged
the
rich
to
give
to
the
poor
in
order
to
avoid
hell
which
he
depicted
in
the
most
frightful
manner
of
which
he
was
capable
and
to
win
paradise
which
he
represented
as
charming
and
desirable
among
the
audience
there
was
a
wealthy
retired
merchant
who
was
somewhat
of
a
usurer
named
m
geborand
who
had
amassed
two
millions
in
the
manufacture
of
coarse
cloth
serges
and
woollen
galloons
never
in
his
whole
life
had
m
geborand
bestowed
alms
on
any
poor
wretch
after
the
delivery
of
that
sermon
it
was
observed
that
he
gave
a
sou
every
sunday
to
the
poor
old
beggar
women
at
the
door
of
the
cathedral
there
were
six
of
them
to
share
it
one
day
the
bishop
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
act
of
bestowing
this
charity
and
said
to
his
sister
with
a
smile
there
is
m
geborand
purchasing
paradise
for
a
sou
when
it
was
a
question
of
charity
he
was
not
to
be
rebuffed
even
by
a
refusal
and
on
such
occasions
he
gave
utterance
to
remarks
which
induced
reflection
once
he
was
begging
for
the
poor
in
a
drawing
room
of
the
town
there
was
present
the
marquis
de
champtercier
a
wealthy
and
avaricious
old
man
who
contrived
to
be
at
one
and
the
same
time
an
ultra
royalist
and
an
ultra
voltairian
this
variety
of
man
has
actually
existed
when
the
bishop
came
to
him
he
touched
his
arm
you
must
give
me
something
m
le
marquis
the
marquis
turned
round
and
answered
dryly
i
have
poor
people
of
my
own
monseigneur
give
them
to
me
replied
the
bishop
one
day
he
preached
the
following
sermon
in
the
cathedral
my
very
dear
brethren
my
good
friends
there
are
thirteen
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
peasants
dwellings
in
france
which
have
but
three
openings
eighteen
hundred
and
seventeen
thousand
hovels
which
have
but
two
openings
the
door
and
one
window
and
three
hundred
and
forty
six
thousand
cabins
besides
which
have
but
one
opening
the
door
and
this
arises
from
a
thing
which
is
called
the
tax
on
doors
and
windows
just
put
poor
families
old
women
and
little
children
in
those
buildings
and
behold
the
fevers
and
maladies
which
result
alas
god
gives
air
to
men
the
law
sells
it
to
them
i
do
not
blame
the
law
but
i
bless
god
in
the
department
of
the
isere
in
the
var
in
the
two
departments
of
the
alpes
the
hautes
and
the
basses
the
peasants
have
not
even
wheelbarrows
they
transport
their
manure
on
the
backs
of
men
they
have
no
candles
and
they
burn
resinous
sticks
and
bits
of
rope
dipped
in
pitch
that
is
the
state
of
affairs
throughout
the
whole
of
the
hilly
country
of
dauphine
they
make
bread
for
six
months
at
one
time
they
bake
it
with
dried
cow
dung
in
the
winter
they
break
this
bread
up
with
an
axe
and
they
soak
it
for
twenty
four
hours
in
order
to
render
it
eatable
my
brethren
have
pity
behold
the
suffering
on
all
sides
of
you
born
a
provencal
he
easily
familiarized
himself
with
the
dialect
of
the
south
he
said
en
be
moussu
ses
sage
as
in
lower
languedoc
onte
anaras
passa
as
in
the
basses
alpes
puerte
un
bouen
moutu
embe
un
bouen
fromage
grase
as
in
upper
dauphine
this
pleased
the
people
extremely
and
contributed
not
a
little
to
win
him
access
to
all
spirits
he
was
perfectly
at
home
in
the
thatched
cottage
and
in
the
mountains
he
understood
how
to
say
the
grandest
things
in
the
most
vulgar
of
idioms
as
he
spoke
all
tongues
he
entered
into
all
hearts
moreover
he
was
the
same
towards
people
of
the
world
and
towards
the
lower
classes
he
condemned
nothing
in
haste
and
without
taking
circumstances
into
account
he
said
examine
the
road
over
which
the
fault
has
passed
being
as
he
described
himself
with
a
smile
an
ex
sinner
he
had
none
of
the
asperities
of
austerity
and
he
professed
with
a
good
deal
of
distinctness
and
without
the
frown
of
the
ferociously
virtuous
a
doctrine
which
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
man
has
upon
him
his
flesh
which
is
at
once
his
burden
and
his
temptation
he
drags
it
with
him
and
yields
to
it
he
must
watch
it
check
it
repress
it
and
obey
it
only
at
the
last
extremity
there
may
be
some
fault
even
in
this
obedience
but
the
fault
thus
committed
is
venial
it
is
a
fall
but
a
fall
on
the
knees
which
may
terminate
in
prayer
to
be
a
saint
is
the
exception
to
be
an
upright
man
is
the
rule
err
fall
sin
if
you
will
but
be
upright
the
least
possible
sin
is
the
law
of
man
no
sin
at
all
is
the
dream
of
the
angel
all
which
is
terrestrial
is
subject
to
sin
sin
is
a
gravitation
when
he
saw
everyone
exclaiming
very
loudly
and
growing
angry
very
quickly
oh
oh
he
said
with
a
smile
to
all
appearance
this
is
a
great
crime
which
all
the
world
commits
these
are
hypocrisies
which
have
taken
fright
and
are
in
haste
to
make
protest
and
to
put
themselves
under
shelter
he
was
indulgent
towards
women
and
poor
people
on
whom
the
burden
of
human
society
rest
he
said
the
faults
of
women
of
children
of
the
feeble
the
indigent
and
the
ignorant
are
the
fault
of
the
husbands
the
fathers
the
masters
the
strong
the
rich
and
the
wise
he
said
moreover
teach
those
who
are
ignorant
as
many
things
as
possible
society
is
culpable
in
that
it
does
not
afford
instruction
gratis
it
is
responsible
for
the
night
which
it
produces
this
soul
is
full
of
shadow
sin
is
therein
committed
the
guilty
one
is
not
the
person
who
has
committed
the
sin
but
the
person
who
has
created
the
shadow
it
will
be
perceived
that
he
had
a
peculiar
manner
of
his
own
of
judging
things
i
suspect
that
he
obtained
it
from
the
gospel
one
day
he
heard
a
criminal
case
which
was
in
preparation
and
on
the
point
of
trial
discussed
in
a
drawing
room
a
wretched
man
being
at
the
end
of
his
resources
had
coined
counterfeit
money
out
of
love
for
a
woman
and
for
the
child
which
he
had
had
by
her
counterfeiting
was
still
punishable
with
death
at
that
epoch
the
woman
had
been
arrested
in
the
act
of
passing
the
first
false
piece
made
by
the
man
she
was
held
but
there
were
no
proofs
except
against
her
she
alone
could
accuse
her
lover
and
destroy
him
by
her
confession
she
denied
they
insisted
she
persisted
in
her
denial
thereupon
an
idea
occurred
to
the
attorney
for
the
crown
he
invented
an
infidelity
on
the
part
of
the
lover
and
succeeded
by
means
of
fragments
of
letters
cunningly
presented
in
persuading
the
unfortunate
woman
that
she
had
a
rival
and
that
the
man
was
deceiving
her
thereupon
exasperated
by
jealousy
she
denounced
her
lover
confessed
all
proved
all
the
man
was
ruined
he
was
shortly
to
be
tried
at
aix
with
his
accomplice
they
were
relating
the
matter
and
each
one
was
expressing
enthusiasm
over
the
cleverness
of
the
magistrate
by
bringing
jealousy
into
play
he
had
caused
the
truth
to
burst
forth
in
wrath
he
had
educed
the
justice
of
revenge
the
bishop
listened
to
all
this
in
silence
when
they
had
finished
he
inquired
where
are
this
man
and
woman
to
be
tried
at
the
court
of
assizes
he
went
on
and
where
will
the
advocate
of
the
crown
be
tried
a
tragic
event
occurred
at
d
a
man
was
condemned
to
death
for
murder
he
was
a
wretched
fellow
not
exactly
educated
not
exactly
ignorant
who
had
been
a
mountebank
at
fairs
and
a
writer
for
the
public
the
town
took
a
great
interest
in
the
trial
on
the
eve
of
the
day
fixed
for
the
execution
of
the
condemned
man
the
chaplain
of
the
prison
fell
ill
a
priest
was
needed
to
attend
the
criminal
in
his
last
moments
they
sent
for
the
cure
it
seems
that
he
refused
to
come
saying
that
is
no
affair
of
mine
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
unpleasant
task
and
with
that
mountebank
i
too
am
ill
and
besides
it
is
not
my
place
this
reply
was
reported
to
the
bishop
who
said
monsieur
le
cure
is
right
it
is
not
his
place
it
is
mine
he
went
instantly
to
the
prison
descended
to
the
cell
of
the
mountebank
called
him
by
name
took
him
by
the
hand
and
spoke
to
him
he
passed
the
entire
day
with
him
forgetful
of
food
and
sleep
praying
to
god
for
the
soul
of
the
condemned
man
and
praying
the
condemned
man
for
his
own
he
told
him
the
best
truths
which
are
also
the
most
simple
he
was
father
brother
friend
he
was
bishop
only
to
bless
he
taught
him
everything
encouraged
and
consoled
him
the
man
was
on
the
point
of
dying
in
despair
death
was
an
abyss
to
him
as
he
stood
trembling
on
its
mournful
brink
he
recoiled
with
horror
he
was
not
sufficiently
ignorant
to
be
absolutely
indifferent
his
condemnation
which
had
been
a
profound
shock
had
in
a
manner
broken
through
here
and
there
that
wall
which
separates
us
from
the
mystery
of
things
and
which
we
call
life
he
gazed
incessantly
beyond
this
world
through
these
fatal
breaches
and
beheld
only
darkness
the
bishop
made
him
see
light
on
the
following
day
when
they
came
to
fetch
the
unhappy
wretch
the
bishop
was
still
there
he
followed
him
and
exhibited
himself
to
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
in
his
purple
camail
and
with
his
episcopal
cross
upon
his
neck
side
by
side
with
the
criminal
bound
with
cords
he
mounted
the
tumbril
with
him
he
mounted
the
scaffold
with
him
the
sufferer
who
had
been
so
gloomy
and
cast
down
on
the
preceding
day
was
radiant
he
felt
that
his
soul
was
reconciled
and
he
hoped
in
god
the
bishop
embraced
him
and
at
the
moment
when
the
knife
was
about
to
fall
he
said
to
him
god
raises
from
the
dead
him
whom
man
slays
he
whom
his
brothers
have
rejected
finds
his
father
once
more
pray
believe
enter
into
life
the
father
is
there
when
he
descended
from
the
scaffold
there
was
something
in
his
look
which
made
the
people
draw
aside
to
let
him
pass
they
did
not
know
which
was
most
worthy
of
admiration
his
pallor
or
his
serenity
on
his
return
to
the
humble
dwelling
which
he
designated
with
a
smile
as
his
palace
he
said
to
his
sister
i
have
just
officiated
pontifically
since
the
most
sublime
things
are
often
those
which
are
the
least
understood
there
were
people
in
the
town
who
said
when
commenting
on
this
conduct
of
the
bishop
it
is
affectation
this
however
was
a
remark
which
was
confined
to
the
drawing
rooms
the
populace
which
perceives
no
jest
in
holy
deeds
was
touched
and
admired
him
as
for
the
bishop
it
was
a
shock
to
him
to
have
beheld
the
guillotine
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
recovered
from
it
in
fact
when
the
scaffold
is
there
all
erected
and
prepared
it
has
something
about
it
which
produces
hallucination
one
may
feel
a
certain
indifference
to
the
death
penalty
one
may
refrain
from
pronouncing
upon
it
from
saying
yes
or
no
so
long
as
one
has
not
seen
a
guillotine
with
one
s
own
eyes
but
if
one
encounters
one
of
them
the
shock
is
violent
one
is
forced
to
decide
and
to
take
part
for
or
against
some
admire
it
like
de
maistre
others
execrate
it
like
beccaria
the
guillotine
is
the
concretion
of
the
law
it
is
called
vindicte
it
is
not
neutral
and
it
does
not
permit
you
to
remain
neutral
he
who
sees
it
shivers
with
the
most
mysterious
of
shivers
all
social
problems
erect
their
interrogation
point
around
this
chopping
knife
the
scaffold
is
a
vision
the
scaffold
is
not
a
piece
of
carpentry
the
scaffold
is
not
a
machine
the
scaffold
is
not
an
inert
bit
of
mechanism
constructed
of
wood
iron
and
cords
it
seems
as
though
it
were
a
being
possessed
of
i
know
not
what
sombre
initiative
one
would
say
that
this
piece
of
carpenter
s
work
saw
that
this
machine
heard
that
this
mechanism
understood
that
this
wood
this
iron
and
these
cords
were
possessed
of
will
in
the
frightful
meditation
into
which
its
presence
casts
the
soul
the
scaffold
appears
in
terrible
guise
and
as
though
taking
part
in
what
is
going
on
the
scaffold
is
the
accomplice
of
the
executioner
it
devours
it
eats
flesh
it
drinks
blood
the
scaffold
is
a
sort
of
monster
fabricated
by
the
judge
and
the
carpenter
a
spectre
which
seems
to
live
with
a
horrible
vitality
composed
of
all
the
death
which
it
has
inflicted
therefore
the
impression
was
terrible
and
profound
on
the
day
following
the
execution
and
on
many
succeeding
days
the
bishop
appeared
to
be
crushed
the
almost
violent
serenity
of
the
funereal
moment
had
disappeared
the
phantom
of
social
justice
tormented
him
he
who
generally
returned
from
all
his
deeds
with
a
radiant
satisfaction
seemed
to
be
reproaching
himself
at
times
he
talked
to
himself
and
stammered
lugubrious
monologues
in
a
low
voice
this
is
one
which
his
sister
overheard
one
evening
and
preserved
i
did
not
think
that
it
was
so
monstrous
it
is
wrong
to
become
absorbed
in
the
divine
law
to
such
a
degree
as
not
to
perceive
human
law
death
belongs
to
god
alone
by
what
right
do
men
touch
that
unknown
thing
in
course
of
time
these
impressions
weakened
and
probably
vanished
nevertheless
it
was
observed
that
the
bishop
thenceforth
avoided
passing
the
place
of
execution
m
myriel
could
be
summoned
at
any
hour
to
the
bedside
of
the
sick
and
dying
he
did
not
ignore
the
fact
that
therein
lay
his
greatest
duty
and
his
greatest
labor
widowed
and
orphaned
families
had
no
need
to
summon
him
he
came
of
his
own
accord
he
understood
how
to
sit
down
and
hold
his
peace
for
long
hours
beside
the
man
who
had
lost
the
wife
of
his
love
of
the
mother
who
had
lost
her
child
as
he
knew
the
moment
for
silence
he
knew
also
the
moment
for
speech
oh
admirable
consoler
he
sought
not
to
efface
sorrow
by
forgetfulness
but
to
magnify
and
dignify
it
by
hope
he
said
have
a
care
of
the
manner
in
which
you
turn
towards
the
dead

not
of
that
which
perishes
gaze
steadily
you
will
perceive
the
living
light
of
your
well
beloved
dead
in
the
depths
of
heaven
he
knew
that
faith
is
wholesome
he
sought
to
counsel
and
calm
the
despairing
man
by
pointing
out
to
him
the
resigned
man
and
to
transform
the
grief
which
gazes
upon
a
grave
by
showing
him
the
grief
which
fixes
its
gaze
upon
a
star
chapter

monseigneur

made
his
cassocks
last
too
long
the
private
life
of
m
myriel
was
filled
with
the
same
thoughts
as
his
public
life
the
voluntary
poverty
in
which
the
bishop
of
d
lived
would
have
been
a
solemn
and
charming
sight
for
any
one
who
could
have
viewed
it
close
at
hand
like
all
old
men
and
like
the
majority
of
thinkers
he
slept
little
this
brief
slumber
was
profound
in
the
morning
he
meditated
for
an
hour
then
he
said
his

at

cathedral
or
in
his

house

busy

every

is
generally
a

and

every
day
his

from

devoted

he
dug
in

had
but
one
word
for
both
these
kinds
of
toil
he
called
them

said
he
towards
mid
day
when
the
weather
was
fine
he
went
forth
and
took
a
stroll
in
the
country
or
in
town
often
entering
lowly
dwellings
he
was
seen
walking
alone
buried
in
his
own
thoughts
his
eyes
cast
down
supporting
himself
on
his
long
cane
clad
in
his
wadded
purple
garment
of
silk
which
was
very
warm
wearing
purple
stockings
inside
his
coarse
shoes
and
surmounted
by
a
flat
hat
which
allowed
three
golden
tassels
of
large
bullion
to
droop
from
its
three
points
it
was
a
perfect
festival
wherever
he
appeared
one
would
have
said
that
his
presence
had
something
warming
and
luminous
about
it
the
children
and
the
old
people
came
out
to
the
doorsteps
for
the
bishop
as
for
the
sun
he
bestowed
his
blessing
and

blessed

the
little

and

upon
the

he
visited
the
poor
so
long
as
he
had
any
money
when
he
no

he
visited
the
rich
as
he
made
his
cassocks
last
a
long
while
and
did
not
wish
to
have
it
noticed
he
never
went
out
in
the
town
without
his
wadded
purple
cloak
this
inconvenienced
him
somewhat
in
summer
on
his
return
he
dined
the
dinner
resembled
his
breakfast
at
half
past
eight
in
the
evening
he
supped
with
his
sister
madame
magloire
standing
behind
them
and
serving
them
at
table
nothing
could
be
more
frugal
than
this
repast
if
however
the
bishop
had
one
of
his
cures
to
supper
madame
magloire
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
serve
monseigneur
with
some
excellent
fish
from
the
lake
or
with
some
fine
game
from
the
mountains
every
cure
furnished
the
pretext
for
a
good
meal
the
bishop
did
not
interfere
with
that
exception
his
ordinary
diet
consisted
only
of
vegetables
boiled
in
water
and
oil
soup
thus
it
was
said
in
the
town
when
the
bishop
does
not
indulge
in
the
cheer
of
a
cure
he
indulges
in
the
cheer
of
a
trappist
after
supper
he
conversed
for
half
an
hour
with
mademoiselle
baptistine
and
madame
magloire
then
he
retired
to
his
own
room
and
set
to
writing
sometimes
on
loose
sheets
and
again
on
the
margin
of
some
folio
he
was
a
man
of
letters
and
rather
learned
he
left
behind
him
five
or
six
very
curious
manuscripts
among
others
a
dissertation
on
this
verse
in
genesis
in
the
beginning
the
spirit
of
god
floated
upon
the
waters
with
this
verse
he
compares
three
texts
the
arabic
verse
which
says
the
winds
of
god
blew
flavius
josephus
who
says
a
wind
from
above
was

upon

finally

paraphrase
of

which
renders
it
a
wind
coming
from

upon
the

in
another
dissertation
he
examines
the
theological
works
of
hugo
bishop
of
ptolemais
great
grand
uncle
to
the
writer
of
this
book
and
establishes
the
fact
that
to
this
bishop
must
be
attributed
the
divers
little
works
published
during
the
last
century
under
the
pseudonym
of
barleycourt
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
his
reading
no
matter
what
the
book
might
be
which
he
had
in
his
hand
he
would
suddenly
fall
into
a
profound
meditation
whence
he
only
emerged
to
write
a
few
lines
on
the
pages
of
the
volume
itself
these
lines
have
often
no
connection
whatever
with
the
book
which
contains
them
we
now
have
under
our
eyes
a
note
written
by

for
him
the
house
in
which
he
lived
consisted
as
we
have
said
of
a
ground
floor
and
one
story
above
three
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
three
chambers
on
the
first
and
an
attic
above
behind
the
house
was
a
garden
a
quarter
of
an
acre
in
extent
the
two
women
occupied
the
first
floor
the
bishop
was
lodged
below
the
first
room
opening
on
the
street
served
him
as
dining
room
the
second
was
his
bedroom
and
the
third
his
oratory
there
was
no
exit
possible
from
this
oratory
except
by
passing
through
the
bedroom
nor
from
the
bedroom
without
passing
through
the
dining
room
at
the
end
of
the
suite
in
the
oratory
there
was
a
detached
alcove
with
a
bed
for
use
in
cases
of
hospitality
the
bishop
offered
this
bed
to
country
curates
whom
business
or
the
requirements
of
their
parishes
brought
to
d
the
pharmacy
of
the
hospital
a
small
building
which
had
been
added
to
the
house
and
abutted
on
the
garden
had
been
transformed
into
a
kitchen
and
cellar
in
addition
to
this
there
was
in
the
garden
a
stable
which
had
formerly
been
the
kitchen
of
the
hospital
and
in
which
the
bishop
kept
two
cows
no
matter
what
the
quantity
of
milk
they
gave
he
invariably
sent
half
of
it
every
morning
to
the
sick
people
in
the
hospital
i
am
paying
my
tithes
he
said
his
bedroom
was
tolerably
large
and
rather
difficult
to
warm
in
bad
weather
as
wood
is
extremely
dear
at
d
he
hit
upon
the
idea
of
having
a
compartment
of
boards
constructed
in
the
cow
shed
here
he
passed
his
evenings
during
seasons
of
severe
cold
he
called
it
his
winter
salon
in
this
winter
salon
as
in
the
dining
room
there
was
no
other
furniture
than
a
square
table
in
white
wood
and
four
straw
seated
chairs
in
addition
to
this
the
dining
room
was
ornamented
with
an
antique
sideboard
painted
pink
in
water
colors
out
of
a
similar
sideboard
properly
draped
with
white
napery
and
imitation
lace
the
bishop
had
constructed
the
altar
which
decorated
his
oratory
his
wealthy
penitents
and
the
sainted
women
of
d
had
more
than
once
assessed
themselves
to
raise
the
money
for
a
new
altar
for
monseigneur
s
oratory
on
each
occasion
he
had
taken
the
money
and
had
given
it
to
the
poor
the
most
beautiful
of
altars
he
said
is
the
soul
of
an
unhappy
creature
consoled
and
thanking
god
in
his
oratory
there
were
two
straw
prie
dieu
and
there
was
an
arm
chair
also
in
straw
in
his
bedroom
when
by
chance
he
received
seven
or
eight
persons
at
one
time
the
prefect
or
the
general
or
the
staff
of
the
regiment
in
garrison
or
several
pupils
from
the
little
seminary
the
chairs
had
to
be
fetched
from
the
winter
salon
in
the
stable
the
prie
dieu
from
the
oratory
and
the
arm
chair
from
the
bedroom
in
this
way
as
many
as
eleven
chairs
could
be
collected
for
the
visitors
a
room
was
dismantled
for
each
new
guest
it
sometimes
happened
that
there
were
twelve
in
the
party
the
bishop
then
relieved
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
by
standing
in
front
of
the
chimney
if
it
was
winter
or
by
strolling
in
the
garden
if
it
was
summer
there
was
still
another
chair
in
the
detached
alcove
but
the
straw
was
half
gone
from
it
and
it
had
but
three
legs
so
that
it
was
of
service
only
when
propped
against
the
wall
mademoiselle
baptistine
had
also
in
her
own
room
a
very
large
easy
chair
of
wood
which
had
formerly
been
gilded
and
which
was
covered
with
flowered
pekin
but
they
had
been
obliged
to
hoist
this
bergere
up
to
the
first
story
through
the
window
as
the
staircase
was
too
narrow
it
could
not
therefore
be
reckoned
among
the
possibilities
in
the
way
of
furniture
mademoiselle
baptistine
s
ambition
had
been
to
be
able
to
purchase
a
set
of
drawing
room
furniture
in
yellow
utrecht
velvet
stamped
with
a
rose
pattern
and
with
mahogany
in
swan
s
neck
style
with
a
sofa
but
this
would
have
cost
five
hundred
francs
at
least
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
had
only
been
able
to
lay
by
forty
two
francs
and
ten
sous
for
this
purpose
in
the
course
of
five
years
she
had
ended
by
renouncing
the
idea
however
who
is
there
who
has
attained
his
ideal
nothing
is
more
easy
to
present
to
the
imagination
than
the
bishop
s
bedchamber
a
glazed
door
opened
on
the
garden
opposite
this
was
the
bed
a
hospital
bed
of
iron
with
a
canopy
of
green
serge
in
the
shadow
of
the
bed
behind
a
curtain
were
the
utensils
of
the
toilet
which
still
betrayed
the
elegant
habits
of
the
man
of
the
world
there
were
two
doors
one
near
the
chimney
opening
into
the
oratory
the
other
near
the
bookcase
opening
into
the
dining
room
the
bookcase
was
a
large
cupboard
with
glass
doors
filled
with
books
the
chimney
was
of
wood
painted
to
represent
marble
and
habitually
without
fire
in
the
chimney
stood
a
pair
of
firedogs
of
iron
ornamented
above
with
two
garlanded
vases
and
flutings
which
had
formerly
been
silvered
with
silver
leaf
which
was
a
sort
of
episcopal
luxury
above
the
chimney
piece
hung
a
crucifix
of
copper
with
the
silver
worn
off
fixed
on
a
background
of
threadbare
velvet
in
a
wooden
frame
from
which
the
gilding
had
fallen
near
the
glass
door
a
large
table
with
an
inkstand
loaded
with
a
confusion
of
papers
and
with
huge
volumes
before
the
table
an
arm
chair
of
straw
in
front
of
the
bed
a
prie
dieu
borrowed
from
the
oratory
two
portraits
in
oval
frames
were
fastened
to
the
wall
on
each
side
of
the
bed
small
gilt
inscriptions
on
the
plain
surface
of
the
cloth
at
the
side
of
these
figures
indicated
that
the
portraits
represented
one
the
abbe
of
chaliot
bishop
of
saint
claude
the
other
the
abbe
tourteau
vicar
general
of
agde
abbe
of
grand
champ
order
of
citeaux
diocese
of
chartres
when
the
bishop
succeeded
to
this
apartment
after
the
hospital
patients
he
had
found
these
portraits
there
and
had
left
them
they
were
priests
and
probably
donors
two
reasons
for
respecting
them
all
that
he
knew
about
these
two
persons
was
that
they
had
been
appointed
by
the
king
the
one
to
his
bishopric
the
other
to
his
benefice
on
the
same
day
the
27th
of
april
1785
madame
magloire
having
taken
the
pictures
down
to
dust
the
bishop
had
discovered
these
particulars
written
in
whitish
ink
on
a
little
square
of
paper
yellowed
by
time
and
attached
to
the
back
of
the
portrait
of
the
abbe
of
grand
champ
with
four
wafers
at
his
window
he
had
an
antique
curtain
of
a
coarse
woollen
stuff
which
finally
became
so
old
that
in
order
to
avoid
the
expense
of
a
new
one
madame
magloire
was
forced
to
take
a
large
seam
in
the
very
middle
of
it
this
seam
took
the
form
of
a
cross
the
bishop
often
called
attention
to
it
how
delightful
that
is
he
said
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
without
exception
those
on
the
ground
floor
as
well
as
those
on
the
first
floor
were
white
washed
which
is
a
fashion
in
barracks
and
hospitals
however
in
their
latter
years
madame
magloire
discovered
beneath
the
paper
which
had
been
washed
over
paintings
ornamenting
the
apartment
of
mademoiselle
baptistine
as
we
shall
see
further
on
before
becoming
a
hospital
this
house
had
been
the
ancient
parliament
house
of
the
bourgeois
hence
this
decoration
the
chambers
were
paved
in
red
bricks
which
were
washed
every
week
with
straw
mats
in
front
of
all
the
beds
altogether
this
dwelling
which
was
attended
to
by
the
two
women
was
exquisitely
clean
from
top
to
bottom
this
was
the
sole
luxury
which
the
bishop
permitted
he
said
that
takes
nothing
from
the
poor
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
he
still
retained
from
his
former
possessions
six
silver
knives
and
forks
and
a
soup
ladle
which
madame
magloire
contemplated
every
day
with
delight
as
they
glistened
splendidly
upon
the
coarse
linen
cloth
and
since
we
are
now
painting
the
bishop
of
d
as
he
was
in
reality
we
must
add
that
he
had
said
more
than
once
i
find
it
difficult
to
renounce
eating
from
silver
dishes
to
this
silverware
must
be
added
two
large
candlesticks
of
massive
silver
which
he
had
inherited
from
a
great
aunt
these
candlesticks
held
two
wax
candles
and
usually
figured
on
the
bishop
s
chimney
piece
when
he
had
any
one
to
dinner
madame
magloire
lighted
the
two
candles
and
set
the
candlesticks
on
the
table
in
the
bishop
s
own
chamber
at
the
head
of
his
bed
there
was
a
small
cupboard
in
which
madame
magloire
locked
up
the
six
silver
knives
and
forks
and
the
big
spoon
every
night
but
it
is
necessary
to
add
that
the
key
was
never
removed
the
garden
which
had
been
rather
spoiled
by
the
ugly
buildings
which
we
have
mentioned
was
composed
of
four
alleys
in
cross
form
radiating
from
a
tank
another
walk
made
the
circuit
of
the
garden
and
skirted
the
white
wall
which
enclosed
it
these
alleys
left
behind
them
four
square
plots
rimmed
with
box
in
three
of
these
madame
magloire
cultivated
vegetables
in
the
fourth
the
bishop
had
planted
some
flowers
here
and
there
stood
a
few
fruit
trees
madame
magloire
had
once
remarked
with
a
sort
of
gentle
malice
monseigneur
you
who
turn
everything
to
account
have
nevertheless
one
useless
plot
it
would
be
better
to
grow
salads
there
than
bouquets
madame
magloire
retorted
the
bishop
you
are
mistaken
the
beautiful
is
as
useful
as
the
useful
he
added
after
a
pause
more
so
perhaps
this
plot
consisting
of
three
or
four
beds
occupied
the
bishop
almost
as
much
as
did
his
books
he
liked
to
pass
an
hour
or
two
there
trimming
hoeing
and
making
holes
here
and
there
in
the
earth
into
which
he
dropped
seeds
he
was
not
as
hostile
to
insects
as
a
gardener
could
have
wished
to
see
him
moreover
he
made
no
pretensions
to
botany
he
ignored
groups
and
consistency
he
made
not
the
slightest
effort
to
decide
between
tournefort
and
the
natural
method
he
took
part
neither
with
the
buds
against
the
cotyledons
nor
with
jussieu
against
linnaeus
he
did
not
study
plants
he
loved
flowers
he
respected
learned
men
greatly
he
respected
the
ignorant
still
more
and
without
ever
failing
in
these
two
respects
he
watered
his
flower
beds
every
summer
evening
with
a
tin
watering
pot
painted
green
the
house
had
not
a
single
door
which
could
be
locked
the
door
of
the
dining
room
which
as
we
have
said
opened
directly
on
the
cathedral
square
had
formerly
been
ornamented
with
locks
and
bolts
like
the
door
of
a
prison
the
bishop
had
had
all
this
ironwork
removed
and
this
door
was
never
fastened
either
by
night
or
by
day
with
anything
except
the
latch
all
that
the
first
passerby
had
to
do
at
any
hour
was
to
give
it
a
push
at
first
the
two
women
had
been
very
much
tried
by
this
door
which
was
never
fastened
but
monsieur
de
d
had
said
to
them
have
bolts
put
on
your
rooms
if
that
will
please
you
they
had
ended
by
sharing
his
confidence
or
by
at
least
acting
as
though
they
shared
it
madame
magloire
alone
had
frights
from
time
to
time
as
for
the
bishop
his
thought
can
be
found
explained
or
at
least
indicated
in
the
three
lines
which
he
wrote
on
the
margin
of
a
bible
this
is
the
shade
of
difference
the
door
of
the
physician
should
never
be
shut
the
door
of
the
priest
should
always
be
open
on
another
book
entitled
philosophy
of
the
medical
science
he
had
written
this
other
note
am
not
i
a
physician
like
them
i
also
have
my
patients
and
then
too
i
have
some
whom
i
call
my
unfortunates
again
he
wrote
do
not
inquire
the
name
of
him
who
asks
a
shelter
of
you
the
very
man
who
is
embarrassed
by
his
name
is
the
one
who
needs
shelter
it
chanced
that
a
worthy
cure
i
know
not
whether
it
was
the
cure
of
couloubroux
or
the
cure
of
pompierry
took
it
into
his
head
to
ask
him
one
day
probably
at
the
instigation
of
madame
magloire
whether
monsieur
was
sure
that
he
was
not
committing
an
indiscretion
to
a
certain
extent
in
leaving
his
door
unfastened
day
and
night
at
the
mercy
of
any
one
who
should
choose
to
enter
and
whether
in
short
he
did
not
fear
lest
some
misfortune
might
occur
in
a
house
so
little
guarded
the
bishop
touched
his
shoulder
with
gentle
gravity
and
said
to
him
nisi
dominus
custodierit
domum
in
vanum
vigilant
qui
custodiunt
eam
unless
the
lord
guard
the
house
in
vain
do
they
watch
who
guard
it
then
he
spoke
of
something
else
he
was
fond
of
saying
there
is
a
bravery
of
the
priest
as
well
as
the
bravery
of
a
colonel
of
dragoons
only
he
added
ours
must
be
tranquil
chapter
vii
cravatte
it
is
here
that
a
fact
falls
naturally
into
place
which
we
must
not
omit
because
it
is
one
of
the
sort
which
show
us
best
what
sort
of
a
man
the
bishop
of
d
was
after
the
destruction
of
the
band
of
gaspard
bes
who
had
infested
the
gorges
of
ollioules
one
of
his
lieutenants
cravatte
took
refuge
in
the
mountains
he
concealed
himself
for
some
time
with
his
bandits
the
remnant
of
gaspard
bes
s
troop
in
the
county
of
nice
then
he
made
his
way
to
piedmont
and
suddenly
reappeared
in
france
in
the
vicinity
of
barcelonette
he
was
first
seen
at
jauziers
then
at
tuiles
he
hid
himself
in
the
caverns
of
the
joug
de
l
aigle
and
thence
he
descended
towards
the
hamlets
and
villages
through
the
ravines
of
ubaye
and
ubayette
he
even
pushed
as
far
as
embrun
entered
the
cathedral
one
night
and
despoiled
the
sacristy
his
highway
robberies
laid
waste
the
country
side
the
gendarmes
were
set
on
his
track
but
in
vain
he
always
escaped
sometimes
he
resisted
by
main
force
he
was
a
bold
wretch
in
the
midst
of
all
this
terror
the
bishop
arrived
he
was
making
his
circuit
to
chastelar
the
mayor
came
to
meet
him
and
urged
him
to
retrace
his
steps
cravatte
was
in
possession
of
the
mountains
as
far
as
arche
and
beyond
there
was
danger
even
with
an
escort
it
merely
exposed
three
or
four
unfortunate
gendarmes
to
no
purpose
therefore
said
the
bishop
i
intend
to
go
without
escort
you
do
not
really
mean
that
monseigneur
exclaimed
the
mayor
i
do
mean
it
so
thoroughly
that
i
absolutely
refuse
any
gendarmes
and
shall
set
out
in
an
hour
set
out
set
out
alone
alone
monseigneur
you
will
not
do
that
there
exists
yonder
in
the
mountains
said
the
bishop
a
tiny
community
no
bigger
than
that
which
i
have
not
seen
for
three
years
they
are
my
good
friends
those
gentle
and
honest
shepherds
they
own
one
goat
out
of
every
thirty
that
they
tend
they
make
very
pretty
woollen
cords
of
various
colors
and
they
play
the
mountain
airs
on
little
flutes
with
six
holes
they
need
to
be
told
of
the
good
god
now
and
then
what
would
they
say
to
a
bishop
who
was
afraid
what
would
they
say
if
i
did
not
go
but
the
brigands
monseigneur
hold
said
the
bishop
i
must
think
of
that
you
are
right
i
may
meet
them
they
too
need
to
be
told
of
the
good
god
but
monseigneur
there
is
a
band
of
them
a
flock
of
wolves
monsieur
le
maire
it
may
be
that
it
is
of
this
very
flock
of
wolves
that
jesus
has
constituted
me
the
shepherd
who
knows
the
ways
of
providence
they
will
rob
you
monseigneur
i
have
nothing
they
will
kill
you
an
old
goodman
of
a
priest
who
passes
along
mumbling
his
prayers
bah
to
what
purpose
oh
mon
dieu
what
if
you
should
meet
them
i
should
beg
alms
of
them
for
my
poor
do
not
go
monseigneur
in
the
name
of
heaven
you
are
risking
your
life
monsieur
le
maire
said
the
bishop
is
that
really
all
i
am
not
in
the
world
to
guard
my
own
life
but
to
guard
souls
they
had
to
allow
him
to
do
as
he
pleased
he
set
out
accompanied
only
by
a
child
who
offered
to
serve
as
a
guide
his
obstinacy
was
bruited
about
the
country
side
and
caused
great
consternation
he
would
take
neither
his
sister
nor
madame
magloire
he
traversed
the
mountain
on
mule
back
encountered
no
one
and
arrived
safe
and
sound
at
the
residence
of
his
good
friends
the
shepherds
he
remained
there
for
a
fortnight
preaching
administering
the
sacrament
teaching
exhorting
when
the
time
of
his
departure
approached
he
resolved
to
chant
a
te
deum
pontifically
he
mentioned
it
to
the
cure
but
what
was
to
be
done
there
were
no
episcopal
ornaments
they
could
only
place
at
his
disposal
a
wretched
village
sacristy
with
a
few
ancient
chasubles
of
threadbare
damask
adorned
with
imitation
lace
bah
said
the
bishop
let
us
announce
our
te
deum
from
the
pulpit
nevertheless
monsieur
le
cure
things
will
arrange
themselves
they
instituted
a
search
in
the
churches
of
the
neighborhood
all
the
magnificence
of
these
humble
parishes
combined
would
not
have
sufficed
to
clothe
the
chorister
of
a
cathedral
properly
while
they
were
thus
embarrassed
a
large
chest
was
brought
and
deposited
in
the
presbytery
for
the
bishop
by
two
unknown
horsemen
who
departed
on
the
instant
the
chest
was
opened
it
contained
a
cope
of
cloth
of
gold
a
mitre
ornamented
with
diamonds
an
archbishop
s
cross
a
magnificent
crosier
all
the
pontifical
vestments
which
had
been
stolen
a
month
previously
from
the
treasury
of
notre
dame
d
embrun
in
the
chest
was
a
paper
on
which
these
words
were
written
from
cravatte
to
monseigneur
bienvenu
did
not
i
say
that
things
would
come
right
of
themselves
said
the
bishop
then
he
added
with
a
smile
to
him
who
contents
himself
with
the
surplice
of
a
curate
god
sends
the
cope
of
an
archbishop
monseigneur
murmured
the
cure
throwing
back
his
head
with
a
smile
god
or
the
devil
the
bishop
looked
steadily
at
the
cure
and
repeated
with
authority
god
when
he
returned
to
chastelar
the
people
came
out
to
stare
at
him
as
at
a
curiosity
all
along
the
road
at
the
priest
s
house
in
chastelar
he
rejoined
mademoiselle
baptistine
and
madame
magloire
who
were
waiting
for
him
and
he
said
to
his
sister
well
was
i
in
the
right
the
poor
priest
went
to
his
poor
mountaineers
with
empty
hands
and
he
returns
from
them
with
his
hands
full
i
set
out
bearing
only
my
faith
in
god
i
have
brought
back
the
treasure
of
a
cathedral
that
evening
before
he
went
to
bed
he
said
again
let
us
never
fear
robbers
nor
murderers
those
are
dangers
from
without
petty
dangers
let
us
fear
ourselves
prejudices
are
the
real
robbers
vices
are
the
real
murderers
the
great
dangers
lie
within
ourselves
what
matters
it
what
threatens
our
head
or
our
purse
let
us
think
only
of
that
which
threatens
our
soul
then
turning
to
his
sister
sister
never
a
precaution
on
the
part
of
the
priest
against
his
fellow
man
that
which
his
fellow
does
god
permits
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
prayer
when
we
think
that
a
danger
is
approaching
us
let
us
pray
not
for
ourselves
but
that
our
brother
may
not
fall
into
sin
on
our
account
however
such
incidents
were
rare
in
his
life
we
relate
those
of
which
we
know
but
generally
he
passed
his
life
in
doing
the
same
things
at
the
same
moment
one
month
of
his
year
resembled
one
hour
of
his
day
as
to
what
became
of
the
treasure
of
the
cathedral
of
embrun
we
should
be
embarrassed
by
any
inquiry
in
that
direction
it
consisted
of
very
handsome
things
very
tempting
things
and
things
which
were
very
well
adapted
to
be
stolen
for
the
benefit
of
the
unfortunate
stolen
they
had
already
been
elsewhere
half
of
the
adventure
was
completed
it
only
remained
to
impart
a
new
direction
to
the
theft
and
to
cause
it
to
take
a
short
trip
in
the
direction
of
the
poor
however
we
make
no
assertions
on
this
point
only
a
rather
obscure
note
was
found
among
the
bishop
s
papers
which
may
bear
some
relation
to
this
matter
and
which
is
couched
in
these
terms
the
question
is
to
decide
whether
this
should
be
turned
over
to
the
cathedral
or
to
the
hospital
chapter
viii
philosophy
after
drinking
the
senator
above
mentioned
was
a
clever
man
who
had
made
his
own
way
heedless
of
those
things
which
present
obstacles
and
which
are
called
conscience
sworn
faith
justice
duty
he
had
marched
straight
to
his
goal
without
once
flinching
in
the
line
of
his
advancement
and
his
interest
he
was
an
old
attorney
softened
by
success
not
a
bad
man
by
any
means
who
rendered
all
the
small
services
in
his
power
to
his
sons
his
sons
in
law
his
relations
and
even
to
his
friends
having
wisely
seized
upon
in
life
good
sides
good
opportunities
good
windfalls
everything
else
seemed
to
him
very
stupid
he
was
intelligent
and
just
sufficiently
educated
to
think
himself
a
disciple
of
epicurus
while
he
was
in
reality
only
a
product
of
pigault
lebrun
he
laughed
willingly
and
pleasantly
over
infinite
and
eternal
things
and
at
the
crotchets
of
that
good
old
fellow
the
bishop
he
even
sometimes
laughed
at
him
with
an
amiable
authority
in
the
presence
of
m
myriel
himself
who
listened
to
him
on
some
semi
official
occasion
or
other
i
do
not
recollect
what
count
this
senator
and
m
myriel
were
to
dine
with
the
prefect
at
dessert
the
senator
who
was
slightly
exhilarated
though
still
perfectly
dignified
exclaimed
egad
bishop
let
s
have
a
discussion
it
is
hard
for
a
senator
and
a
bishop
to
look
at
each
other
without
winking
we
are
two
augurs
i
am
going
to
make
a
confession
to
you
i
have
a
philosophy
of
my
own
and
you
are
right
replied
the
bishop
as
one
makes
one
s
philosophy
so
one
lies
on
it
you
are
on
the
bed
of
purple
senator
the
senator
was
encouraged
and
went
on
let
us
be
good
fellows
good
devils
even
said
the
bishop
i
declare
to
you
continued
the
senator
that
the
marquis
d
argens
pyrrhon
hobbes
and
m
naigeon
are
no
rascals
i
have
all
the
philosophers
in
my
library
gilded
on
the
edges
like
yourself
count
interposed
the
bishop
the
senator
resumed
i
hate
diderot
he
is
an
ideologist
a
declaimer
and
a
revolutionist
a
believer
in
god
at
bottom
and
more
bigoted
than
voltaire
voltaire
made
sport
of
needham
and
he
was
wrong
for
needham
s
eels
prove
that
god
is
useless
a
drop
of
vinegar
in
a
spoonful
of
flour
paste
supplies
the
fiat
lux
suppose
the
drop
to
be
larger
and
the
spoonful
bigger
you
have
the
world
man
is
the
eel
then
what
is
the
good
of
the
eternal
father
the
jehovah
hypothesis
tires
me
bishop
it
is
good
for
nothing
but
to
produce
shallow
people
whose
reasoning
is
hollow
down
with
that
great
all
which
torments
me
hurrah
for
zero
which
leaves
me
in
peace
between
you
and
me
and
in
order
to
empty
my
sack
and
make
confession
to
my
pastor
as
it
behooves
me
to
do
i
will
admit
to
you
that
i
have
good
sense
i
am
not
enthusiastic
over
your
jesus
who
preaches
renunciation
and
sacrifice
to
the
last
extremity
tis
the
counsel
of
an
avaricious
man
to
beggars
renunciation
why
sacrifice
to
what
end
i
do
not
see
one
wolf
immolating
himself
for
the
happiness
of
another
wolf
let
us
stick
to
nature
then
we
are
at
the
top
let
us
have
a
superior
philosophy
what
is
the
advantage
of
being
at
the
top
if
one
sees
no
further
than
the
end
of
other
people
s
noses
let
us
live
merrily
life
is
all
that
man
has
another
future
elsewhere
on
high
below
anywhere
i
don
t
believe
not
one
single
word
of
it
ah
sacrifice
and
renunciation
are
recommended
to
me
i
must
take
heed
to
everything
i
do
i
must
cudgel
my
brains
over
good
and
evil
over
the
just
and
the
unjust
over
the
fas
and
the
nefas
why
because
i
shall
have
to
render
an
account
of
my
actions
when
after
death
what
a
fine
dream
after
my
death
it
will
be
a
very
clever
person
who
can
catch
me
have
a
handful
of
dust
seized
by
a
shadow
hand
if
you
can
let
us
tell
the
truth
we
who
are
initiated
and
who
have
raised
the
veil
of
isis
there
is
no
such
thing
as
either
good
or
evil
there
is
vegetation
let
us
seek
the
real
let
us
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
let
us
go
into
it
thoroughly
what
the
deuce
let
us
go
to
the
bottom
of
it
we
must
scent
out
the
truth
dig
in
the
earth
for
it
and
seize
it
then
it
gives
you
exquisite
joys
then
you
grow
strong
and
you
laugh
i
am
square
on
the
bottom
i
am

a

adam
has
we
are

we

be

with

on

come

is
it
not

who
says
that
the

shall
travel
from

to

very
well
we
shall
be
the
grasshoppers
of
the
stars
and
then
besides
we
shall
see
god
ta
ta
ta
what
twaddle
all
these
paradises
are
god
is
a
nonsensical
monster
i
would
not
say
that
in
the
moniteur
egad
but
i
may
whisper
it
among
friends
inter
pocula
to
sacrifice
the
world
to
paradise
is
to
let
slip
the
prey
for
the
shadow
be
the
dupe
of
the
infinite
i
m
not
such
a
fool
i
am
a
nought
i
call

monsieur
le

nought
senator
did
i
exist

no

what

the

suffer

i
shall

lead

my

must

it
is
better
to

such
is
my

the

this
is
the
vanishing
point
death
is

believe
me
i
laugh
at
the
idea
of
there
being
any
one
who
has
anything
to
tell
me
on
that
subject
fables

for

jehovah
for

no
our
to
morrow
is
the
night
beyond
the
tomb
there
is
nothing
but
equal
nothingness
you
have
been
sardanapalus
you
have
been
vincent
de
paul
it
makes
no
difference
that
is
the
truth
then
live
your
life
above
all
things
make
use
of
your
i
while
you
have
it
in
truth
bishop
i
tell
you
that
i
have
a
philosophy
of
my
own
and
i
have
my
philosophers
i
don
t
let
myself
be
taken
in
with
that
nonsense
of
course
there
must
be
something
for
those
who
are
down
for
the
barefooted
beggars
knife
grinders
and
miserable
wretches
legends
chimeras
the
soul
immortality
paradise
the
stars
are
provided
for
them
to
swallow
they
gobble
it
down
they
spread
it
on
their
dry
bread
he
who
has
nothing
else
has
the
good
god
that
is
the
least
he
can
have
i
oppose
no
objection
to
that
but
i
reserve
monsieur
naigeon
for
myself
the
good
god
is
good
for
the
populace
the
bishop
clapped
his
hands
that
s
talking
he
exclaimed
what
an
excellent
and
really
marvellous
thing
is
this
materialism
not
every
one
who
wants
it
can
have
it
ah
when
one
does
have
it
one
is
no
longer
a
dupe
one
does
not
stupidly
allow
one
s
self
to
be
exiled
like
cato
nor
stoned
like
stephen
nor
burned
alive
like
jeanne
d
arc
those
who
have
succeeded
in
procuring
this
admirable
materialism
have
the
joy
of
feeling
themselves
irresponsible
and
of
thinking
that
they
can
devour
everything
without
uneasiness
places
sinecures
dignities
power
whether
well
or
ill
acquired
lucrative
recantations
useful
treacheries
savory
capitulations
of
conscience
and
that
they
shall
enter
the
tomb
with
their
digestion
accomplished
how
agreeable
that
is
i
do
not
say
that
with
reference
to
you
senator
nevertheless
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
refrain
from
congratulating
you
you
great
lords
have
so
you
say
a
philosophy
of
your
own
and
for
yourselves
which
is
exquisite
refined
accessible
to
the
rich
alone
good
for
all
sauces
and
which
seasons
the
voluptuousness
of
life
admirably
this
philosophy
has
been
extracted
from
the
depths
and
unearthed
by
special
seekers
but
you
are
good
natured
princes
and
you
do
not
think
it
a
bad
thing
that
belief
in
the
good
god
should
constitute
the
philosophy
of
the
people
very
much
as
the
goose
stuffed
with
chestnuts
is
the
truffled
turkey
of
the
poor
chapter
ix
the
brother
as
depicted
by
the
sister
in
order
to
furnish
an
idea
of
the
private
establishment
of
the
bishop
of
d
and
of
the
manner
in
which
those
two
sainted
women
subordinated
their
actions
their
thoughts
their
feminine
instincts
even
which
are
easily
alarmed
to
the
habits
and
purposes
of
the
bishop
without
his
even
taking
the
trouble
of
speaking
in
order
to
explain
them
we
cannot
do
better
than
transcribe
in
this
place
a
letter
from
mademoiselle
baptistine
to
madame
the
vicomtess
de
boischevron
the
friend
of
her
childhood
this
letter
is

my
good
madam
not
a
day
passes
without
our
speaking
of
you
it
is
our
established
custom
but
there
is
another
reason
besides
just
imagine
while
washing
and
dusting
the
ceilings
and
walls
madam
magloire
has
made
some
discoveries
now
our
two
chambers
hung
with
antique
paper
whitewashed
over
would
not
discredit
a
chateau
in
the
style
of
yours
madam
magloire
has
pulled
off
all
the
paper
there
were
things
beneath
my
drawing
room
which
contains
no
furniture
and
which
we
use
for
spreading
out
the
linen
after
washing
is
fifteen
feet
in
height
eighteen
square
with
a
ceiling
which
was
formerly
painted
and
gilded
and
with
beams
as
in
yours
this
was
covered
with
a
cloth
while
this
was
the
hospital
and
the
woodwork
was
of
the
era
of
our
grandmothers
but
my
room
is
the
one
you
ought
to
see
madam
magloire
has
discovered
under
at
least
ten
thicknesses
of
paper
pasted
on
top
some
paintings
which
without
being
good
are
very
tolerable
the
subject
is
telemachus
being
knighted
by
minerva
in
some
gardens
the
name
of
which
escapes
me
in
short
where
the
roman
ladies
repaired
on
one
single
night
what
shall
i
say
to
you
i
have
romans
and
roman
ladies
here
occurs
an
illegible
word
and
the
whole
train
madam
magloire
has
cleaned
it
all
off
this
summer
she
is
going
to
have
some
small
injuries
repaired
and
the
whole
revarnished
and
my
chamber
will
be
a
regular
museum
she
has
also
found
in
a
corner
of
the
attic
two
wooden
pier
tables
of
ancient
fashion
they
asked
us
two
crowns
of
six
francs
each
to
regild
them
but
it
is
much
better
to
give
the
money
to
the
poor
and
they
are
very
ugly
besides
and
i
should
much
prefer
a
round
table
of
mahogany
i
am
always
very
happy
my
brother
is
so
good
he
gives
all
he
has
to
the
poor
and
sick
we
are
very
much
cramped
the
country
is
trying
in
the
winter
and
we
really
must
do
something
for
those
who
are
in
need
we
are
almost
comfortably
lighted
and
warmed
you
see
that
these
are
great
treats
my
brother
has
ways
of
his
own
when
he
talks
he
says
that
a
bishop
ought
to
be
so
just
imagine
the
door
of
our
house
is
never
fastened
whoever
chooses
to
enter
finds
himself
at
once
in
my
brother
s
room
he
fears
nothing
even
at
night
that
is
his
sort
of
bravery
he
says
he
does
not
wish
me
or
madame
magloire
feel
any
fear
for
him
he
exposes
himself
to
all
sorts
of
dangers
and
he
does
not
like
to
have
us
even
seem
to
notice
it
one
must
know
how
to
understand
him
he
goes
out
in
the
rain
he
walks
in
the
water
he
travels
in
winter
he
fears
neither
suspicious
roads
nor
dangerous
encounters
nor
night
last
year
he
went
quite
alone
into
a
country
of
robbers
he
would
not
take
us
he
was
absent
for
a
fortnight
on
his
return
nothing
had
happened
to
him
he
was
thought
to
be
dead
but
was
perfectly
well
and
said
this
is
the
way
i
have
been
robbed
and
then
he
opened
a
trunk
full
of
jewels
all
the
jewels
of
the
cathedral
of
embrun
which
the
thieves
had
given
him
when
he
returned
on
that
occasion
i
could
not
refrain
from
scolding
him
a
little
taking
care
however
not
to
speak
except
when
the
carriage
was
making
a
noise
so
that
no
one
might
hear
me
at
first
i
used
to
say
to
myself
there
are
no
dangers
which
will
stop
him
he
is
terrible
now
i
have
ended
by
getting
used
to
it
i
make
a
sign
to
madam
magloire
that
she
is
not
to
oppose
him
he
risks
himself
as
he
sees
fit
i
carry
off
madam
magloire
i
enter
my
chamber
i
pray
for
him
and
fall
asleep
i
am
at
ease
because
i
know
that
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
him
it
would
be
the
end
of
me
i
should
go
to
the
good
god
with
my
brother
and
my
bishop
it
has
cost
madam
magloire
more
trouble
than
it
did
me
to
accustom
herself
to
what
she
terms
his
imprudences
but
now
the
habit
has
been
acquired
we
pray
together
we
tremble
together
and
we
fall
asleep
if
the
devil
were
to
enter
this
house
he
would
be
allowed
to
do
so
after
all
what
is
there
for
us
to
fear
in
this
house
there
is
always
some
one
with
us
who
is
stronger
than
we
the
devil
may
pass
through
it
but
the
good
god
dwells
here
this
suffices
me
my
brother
has
no
longer
any
need
of
saying
a
word
to
me
i
understand
him
without
his
speaking
and
we
abandon
ourselves
to
the
care
of
providence
that
is
the
way
one
has
to
do
with
a
man
who
possesses
grandeur
of
soul
i
have
interrogated
my
brother
with
regard
to
the
information
which
you
desire
on
the
subject
of
the
faux
family
you
are
aware
that
he
knows
everything
and
that
he
has
memories
because
he
is
still
a
very
good
royalist
they
really
are
a
very
ancient
norman
family
of
the
generalship
of
caen
five
hundred
years
ago
there
was
a
raoul
de
faux
a
jean
de
faux
and
a
thomas
de
faux
who
were
gentlemen
and
one
of
whom
was
a
seigneur
de
rochefort
the
last
was
guy
etienne
alexandre
and
was
commander
of
a
regiment
and
something
in
the
light
horse
of
bretagne
his
daughter
marie
louise
married
adrien
charles
de
gramont
son
of
the
duke
louis
de
gramont
peer
of
france
colonel
of
the
french
guards
and
lieutenant
general
of
the
army
it
is
written
faux
fauq
and
faoucq
good
madame
recommend
us
to
the
prayers
of
your
sainted
relative
monsieur
the
cardinal
as
for
your
dear
sylvanie
she
has
done
well
in
not
wasting
the
few
moments
which
she
passes
with
you
in
writing
to
me
she
is
well
works
as
you
would
wish
and
loves
me
that
is
all
that
i
desire
the
souvenir
which
she
sent
through
you
reached
me
safely
and
it
makes
me
very
happy
my
health
is
not
so
very
bad
and
yet
i
grow
thinner
every
day
farewell
my
paper
is
at
an
end
and
this
forces
me
to
leave
you
a
thousand
good
wishes
baptistine
p
s
your
grand
nephew
is
charming
do
you
know
that
he
will
soon
be
five
years
old
yesterday
he
saw
some
one
riding
by
on
horseback
who
had
on
knee
caps
and
he
said
what
has
he
got
on
his
knees
he
is
a
charming
child
his
little
brother
is
dragging
an
old
broom
about
the
room
like
a
carriage
and
saying
hu
as
will
be
perceived
from
this
letter
these
two
women
understood
how
to
mould
themselves
to
the
bishop
s
ways
with
that
special
feminine
genius
which
comprehends
the
man
better
than
he
comprehends
himself
the
bishop
of
d
in
spite
of
the
gentle
and
candid
air
which
never
deserted
him
sometimes
did
things
that
were
grand
bold
and
magnificent
without
seeming
to
have
even
a
suspicion
of
the
fact
they
trembled
but
they
let
him
alone
sometimes
madame
magloire
essayed
a
remonstrance
in
advance
but
never
at
the
time
nor
afterwards
they
never
interfered
with
him
by
so
much
as
a
word
or
sign
in
any
action
once
entered
upon
at
certain
moments
without
his
having
occasion
to
mention
it
when
he
was
not
even
conscious
of
it
himself
in
all
probability
so
perfect
was
his
simplicity
they
vaguely
felt
that
he
was
acting
as
a
bishop
then
they
were
nothing
more
than
two
shadows
in
the
house
they
served
him
passively
and
if
obedience
consisted
in
disappearing
they
disappeared
they
understood
with
an
admirable
delicacy
of
instinct
that
certain
cares
may
be
put
under
constraint
thus
even
when
believing
him
to
be
in
peril
they
understood
i
will
not
say
his
thought
but
his
nature
to
such
a
degree
that
they
no
longer
watched
over
him
they
confided
him
to
god
moreover
baptistine
said
as
we
have
just
read
that
her
brother
s
end
would
prove
her
own
madame
magloire
did
not
say
this
but
she
knew
it
chapter
x
the
bishop
in
the
presence
of
an
unknown
light
at
an
epoch
a
little
later
than
the
date
of
the
letter
cited
in
the
preceding
pages
he
did
a
thing
which
if
the
whole
town
was
to
be
believed
was
even
more
hazardous
than
his
trip
across
the
mountains
infested
with
bandits
in
the
country
near
d
a
man
lived
quite
alone
this
man
we
will
state
at
once
was
a
former
member
of
the
convention
his
name
was
g
member
of
the
convention
g
was
mentioned
with
a
sort
of
horror
in
the
little
world
of
d
a
member
of
the
convention
can
you
imagine
such
a
thing
that
existed
from
the
time
when
people
called
each
other
thou
and
when
they
said
citizen
this
man
was
almost
a
monster
he
had
not
voted
for
the
death
of
the
king
but
almost
he
was
a
quasi
regicide
he
had
been
a
terrible
man
how
did
it
happen
that
such
a
man
had
not
been
brought
before
a
provost
s
court
on
the
return
of
the
legitimate
princes
they
need
not
have
cut
off
his
head
if
you
please
clemency
must
be
exercised
agreed
but
a
good
banishment
for
life
an
example
in
short
etc
besides
he
was
an
atheist
like
all
the
rest
of
those
people
gossip
of
the
geese
about
the
vulture
was
g
a
vulture
after
all
yes
if
he
were
to
be
judged
by
the
element
of
ferocity
in
this
solitude
of
his
as
he
had
not
voted
for
the
death
of
the
king
he
had
not
been
included
in
the
decrees
of
exile
and
had
been
able
to
remain
in
france
he
dwelt
at
a
distance
of
three
quarters
of
an
hour
from
the
city
far
from
any
hamlet
far
from
any
road
in
some
hidden
turn
of
a
very
wild
valley
no
one
knew
exactly
where
he
had
there
it
was
said
a
sort
of
field
a
hole
a
lair
there
were
no
neighbors
not
even
passers
by
since
he
had
dwelt
in
that
valley
the
path
which
led
thither
had
disappeared
under
a
growth
of
grass
the
locality
was
spoken
of
as
though
it
had
been
the
dwelling
of
a
hangman
nevertheless
the
bishop
meditated
on
the
subject
and
from
time
to
time
he
gazed
at
the
horizon
at
a
point
where
a
clump
of
trees
marked
the
valley
of
the
former
member
of
the
convention
and
he
said
there
is
a
soul
yonder
which
is
lonely
and
he
added
deep
in
his
own
mind
i
owe
him
a
visit
but
let
us
avow
it
this
idea
which
seemed
natural
at
the
first
blush
appeared
to
him
after
a
moment
s
reflection
as
strange
impossible
and
almost
repulsive
for
at
bottom
he
shared
the
general
impression
and
the
old
member
of
the
convention
inspired
him
without
his
being
clearly
conscious
of
the
fact
himself
with
that
sentiment
which
borders
on
hate
and
which
is
so
well
expressed
by
the
word
estrangement
still
should
the
scab
of
the
sheep
cause
the
shepherd
to
recoil
no
but
what
a
sheep
the
good
bishop
was
perplexed
sometimes
he
set
out
in
that
direction
then
he
returned
finally
the
rumor
one
day
spread
through
the
town
that
a
sort
of
young
shepherd
who
served
the
member
of
the
convention
in
his
hovel
had
come
in
quest
of
a
doctor
that
the
old
wretch
was
dying
that
paralysis
was
gaining
on
him
and
that
he
would
not
live
over
night
thank
god
some
added
the
bishop
took
his
staff
put
on
his
cloak
on
account
of
his
too
threadbare
cassock
as
we
have
mentioned
and
because
of
the
evening
breeze
which
was
sure
to
rise
soon
and
set
out
the
sun
was
setting
and
had
almost
touched
the
horizon
when
the
bishop
arrived
at
the
excommunicated
spot
with
a
certain
beating
of
the
heart
he
recognized
the
fact
that
he
was
near
the
lair
he
strode
over
a
ditch
leaped
a
hedge
made
his
way
through
a
fence
of
dead
boughs
entered
a
neglected
paddock
took
a
few
steps
with
a
good
deal
of
boldness
and
suddenly
at
the
extremity
of
the
waste
land
and
behind
lofty
brambles
he
caught
sight
of
the
cavern
it
was
a
very
low
hut
poor
small
and
clean
with
a
vine
nailed
against
the
outside
near
the
door
in
an
old
wheel
chair
the
arm
chair
of
the
peasants
there
was
a
white
haired
man
smiling
at
the
sun
near
the
seated
man
stood
a
young
boy
the
shepherd
lad
he
was
offering
the
old
man
a
jar
of
milk
while
the
bishop
was
watching
him
the
old
man
spoke
thank
you
he
said
i
need
nothing
and
his
smile
quitted
the
sun
to
rest
upon
the
child
the
bishop
stepped
forward
at
the
sound
which
he
made
in
walking
the
old
man
turned
his
head
and
his
face
expressed
the
sum
total
of
the
surprise
which
a
man
can
still
feel
after
a
long
life
this
is
the
first
time
since
i
have
been
here
said
he
that
any
one
has
entered
here
who
are
you
sir
the
bishop
answered
my
name
is
bienvenu
myriel
bienvenu
myriel
i
have
heard
that
name
are
you
the
man
whom
the
people
call
monseigneur
welcome
i
am
the
old
man
resumed
with
a
half
smile
in
that
case
you
are
my
bishop
something
of
that
sort
enter
sir
the
member
of
the
convention
extended
his
hand
to
the
bishop
but
the
bishop
did
not
take
it
the
bishop
confined
himself
to
the
remark
i
am
pleased
to
see
that
i
have
been
misinformed
you
certainly
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
ill
monsieur
replied
the
old
man
i
am
going
to
recover
he
paused
and
then
said
i
shall
die
three
hours
hence
then
he
continued
i
am
something
of
a
doctor
i
know
in
what
fashion
the
last
hour
draws
on
yesterday
only
my
feet
were
cold
to
day
the
chill
has
ascended
to
my
knees
now
i
feel
it
mounting
to
my
waist
when
it
reaches
the
heart
i
shall
stop
the
sun
is
beautiful
is
it
not
i
had
myself
wheeled
out
here
to
take
a
last
look
at
things
you
can
talk
to
me
it
does
not
fatigue
me
you
have
done
well
to
come
and
look
at
a
man
who
is
on
the
point
of
death
it
is
well
that
there
should
be
witnesses
at
that
moment
one
has
one
s
caprices
i
should
have
liked
to
last
until
the
dawn
but
i
know
that
i
shall
hardly
live
three
hours
it
will
be
night
then
what
does
it
matter
after
all
dying
is
a
simple
affair
one
has
no
need
of
the
light
for
that
so
be
it
i
shall
die
by
starlight
the
old
man
turned
to
the
shepherd
lad
go
to
thy
bed
thou
wert
awake
all
last
night
thou
art
tired
the
child
entered
the
hut
the
old
man
followed
him
with
his
eyes
and
added
as
though
speaking
to
himself
i
shall
die
while
he
sleeps
the
two
slumbers
may
be
good
neighbors
the
bishop
was
not
touched
as
it
seems
that
he
should
have
been
he
did
not
think
he
discerned
god
in
this
manner
of
dying
let
us
say
the
whole
for
these
petty
contradictions
of
great
hearts
must
be
indicated
like
the
rest
he
who
on
occasion
was
so
fond
of
laughing
at
his
grace
was
rather
shocked
at
not
being
addressed
as
monseigneur
and
he
was
almost
tempted
to
retort
citizen
he
was
assailed
by
a
fancy
for
peevish
familiarity
common
enough
to
doctors
and
priests
but
which
was
not
habitual
with
him
this
man
after
all
this
member
of
the
convention
this
representative
of
the
people
had
been
one
of
the
powerful
ones
of
the
earth
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
probably
the
bishop
felt
in
a
mood
to
be
severe
meanwhile
the
member
of
the
convention
had
been
surveying
him
with
a
modest
cordiality
in
which
one
could
have
distinguished
possibly
that
humility
which
is
so
fitting
when
one
is
on
the
verge
of
returning
to
dust
the
bishop
on
his
side
although
he
generally
restrained
his
curiosity
which
in
his
opinion
bordered
on
a
fault
could
not
refrain
from
examining
the
member
of
the
convention
with
an
attention
which
as
it
did
not
have
its
course
in
sympathy
would
have
served
his
conscience
as
a
matter
of
reproach
in
connection
with
any
other
man
a
member
of
the
convention
produced
on
him
somewhat
the
effect
of
being
outside
the
pale
of
the
law
even
of
the
law
of
charity
g
calm
his
body
almost
upright
his
voice
vibrating
was
one
of
those
octogenarians
who
form
the
subject
of
astonishment
to
the
physiologist
the
revolution
had
many
of
these
men
proportioned
to
the
epoch
in
this
old
man
one
was
conscious
of
a
man
put
to
the
proof
though
so
near
to
his
end
he
preserved
all
the
gestures
of
health
in
his
clear
glance
in
his
firm
tone
in
the
robust
movement
of
his
shoulders
there
was
something
calculated
to
disconcert
death
azrael
the
mohammedan
angel
of
the
sepulchre
would
have
turned
back
and
thought
that
he
had
mistaken
the
door
g
seemed
to
be
dying
because
he
willed
it
so
there
was
freedom
in
his
agony
his
legs
alone
were
motionless
it
was
there
that
the
shadows
held
him
fast
his
feet
were
cold
and
dead
but
his
head
survived
with
all
the
power
of
life
and
seemed
full
of
light
g
at
this
solemn
moment
resembled
the
king
in
that
tale
of
the
orient
who
was
flesh
above
and
marble
below
there
was
a
stone
there
the
bishop
sat
down
the
exordium
was
abrupt
i
congratulate
you
said
he
in
the
tone
which
one
uses
for
a
reprimand
you
did
not
vote
for
the
death
of
the
king
after
all
the
old
member
of
the
convention
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
bitter
meaning
underlying
the
words
after
all
he
replied
the
smile
had
quite
disappeared
from
his
face
do
not
congratulate
me
too
much
sir
i
did
vote
for
the
death
of
the
tyrant
it
was
the
tone
of
austerity
answering
the
tone
of
severity
what
do
you
mean
to
say
resumed
the
bishop
i
mean
to
say
that
man
has
a
tyrant
ignorance
i
voted
for
the
death
of
that
tyrant
that
tyrant
engendered
royalty
which
is
authority
falsely
understood
while
science
is
authority
rightly
understood
man
should
be
governed
only
by
science
and
conscience
added
the
bishop
it
is
the
same
thing
conscience
is
the
quantity
of
innate
science
which
we
have
within
us
monseigneur
bienvenu
listened
in
some
astonishment
to
this
language
which
was
very
new
to
him
the
member
of
the
convention
resumed
so
far
as
louis
xvi
was
concerned
i
said
no
i
did
not
think
that
i
had
the
right
to
kill
a
man
but
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
exterminate
evil
i
voted
the
end
of
the
tyrant
that
is
to
say
the
end
of
prostitution
for
woman
the
end
of
slavery
for
man
the
end
of
night
for
the
child
in
voting
for
the
republic
i
voted
for
that
i
voted
for
fraternity
concord
the
dawn
i
have
aided
in
the
overthrow
of
prejudices
and
errors
the
crumbling
away
of
prejudices
and
errors
causes
light
we
have
caused
the
fall
of
the
old
world
and
the
old
world
that
vase
of
miseries
has
become
through
its
upsetting
upon
the
human
race
an
urn
of
joy
mixed
joy
said
the
bishop
you
may
say
troubled
joy
and
to
day
after
that
fatal
return
of
the
past
which
is
called
1814
joy
which
has
disappeared
alas
the
work
was
incomplete
i
admit
we
demolished
the
ancient
regime
in
deeds
we
were
not
able
to
suppress
it
entirely
in
ideas
to
destroy
abuses
is
not
sufficient
customs
must
be
modified
the
mill
is
there
no
longer
the
wind
is
still
there
you
have
demolished
it
may
be
of
use
to
demolish
but
i
distrust
a
demolition
complicated
with
wrath
right
has
its
wrath
bishop
and
the
wrath
of
right
is
an
element
of
progress
in
any
case
and
in
spite
of
whatever
may
be
said
the
french
revolution
is
the
most
important
step
of
the
human
race
since
the
advent
of
christ
incomplete
it
may
be
but
sublime
it
set
free
all
the
unknown
social
quantities
it
softened
spirits
it
calmed
appeased
enlightened
it
caused
the
waves
of
civilization
to
flow
over
the
earth
it
was
a
good
thing
the
french
revolution
is
the
consecration
of
humanity
the
bishop
could
not
refrain
from
murmuring
yes
93
the
member
of
the
convention
straightened
himself
up
in
his
chair
with
an
almost
lugubrious
solemnity
and
exclaimed
so
far
as
a
dying
man
is
capable
of
exclamation
ah
there
you
go
93
i
was
expecting
that
word
a
cloud
had
been
forming
for
the
space
of
fifteen
hundred
years
at
the
end
of
fifteen
hundred
years
it
burst
you
are
putting
the
thunderbolt
on
its
trial
the
bishop
felt
without
perhaps
confessing
it
that
something
within
him
had
suffered
extinction
nevertheless
he
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
he
replied
the
judge
speaks
in
the
name
of
justice
the
priest
speaks
in
the
name
of
pity
which
is
nothing
but
a
more
lofty
justice
a
thunderbolt
should
commit
no
error
and
he
added
regarding
the
member
of
the
convention
steadily
the
while
louis
xvii
the
conventionary
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
grasped
the
bishop
s
arm
louis
xvii
let
us
see
for
whom
do
you
mourn
is
it
for
the
innocent
child
very
good
in
that
case
i
mourn
with
you
is
it
for
the
royal
child
i
demand
time
for
reflection
to
me
the
brother
of
cartouche
an
innocent
child
who
was
hung
up
by
the
armpits
in
the
place
de
greve
until
death
ensued
for
the
sole
crime
of
having
been
the
brother
of
cartouche
is
no
less
painful
than
the
grandson
of
louis
xv
an
innocent
child
martyred
in
the
tower
of
the
temple
for
the
sole
crime
of
having
been
grandson
of
louis
xv
monsieur
said
the
bishop
i
like
not
this
conjunction
of
names
cartouche
louis
xv
to
which
of
the
two
do
you
object
a
momentary
silence
ensued
the
bishop
almost
regretted
having
come
and
yet
he
felt
vaguely
and
strangely
shaken
the
conventionary
resumed
ah
monsieur
priest
you
love
not
the
crudities
of
the
true
christ
loved
them
he
seized
a
rod
and
cleared
out
the
temple
his
scourge
full
of
lightnings
was
a
harsh
speaker
of
truths
when
he
cried
sinite
parvulos
he
made
no
distinction
between
the
little
children
it
would
not
have
embarrassed
him
to
bring
together
the
dauphin
of
barabbas
and
the
dauphin
of
herod
innocence
monsieur
is
its
own
crown
innocence
has
no
need
to
be
a
highness
it
is
as
august
in
rags
as
in
fleurs
de
lys
that
is
true
said
the
bishop
in
a
low
voice
i
persist
continued
the
conventionary
g
you
have
mentioned
louis
xvii
to
me
let
us
come
to
an
understanding
shall
we
weep
for
all
the
innocent
all
martyrs
all
children
the
lowly
as
well
as
the
exalted
i
agree
to
that
but
in
that
case
as
i
have
told
you
we
must
go
back
further
than
93
and
our
tears
must
begin
before
louis
xvii
i
will
weep
with
you
over
the
children
of
kings
provided
that
you
will
weep
with
me
over
the
children
of
the
people
i
weep
for
all
said
the
bishop
equally
exclaimed
conventionary
g
and
if
the
balance
must
incline
let
it
be
on
the
side
of
the
people
they
have
been
suffering
longer
another
silence
ensued
the
conventionary
was
the
first
to
break
it
he
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
took
a
bit
of
his
cheek
between
his
thumb
and
his
forefinger
as
one
does
mechanically
when
one
interrogates
and
judges
and
appealed
to
the
bishop
with
a
gaze
full
of
all
the
forces
of
the
death
agony
it
was
almost
an
explosion
yes
sir
the
people
have
been
suffering
a
long
while
and
hold
that
is
not
all
either
why
have
you
just
questioned
me
and
talked
to
me
about
louis
xvii
i
know
you
not
ever
since
i
have
been
in
these
parts
i
have
dwelt
in
this
enclosure
alone
never
setting
foot
outside
and
seeing
no
one
but
that
child
who
helps
me
your
name
has
reached
me
in
a
confused
manner
it
is
true
and
very
badly
pronounced
i
must
admit
but
that
signifies
nothing
clever
men
have
so
many
ways
of
imposing
on
that
honest
goodman
the
people
by
the
way
i
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
your
carriage
you
have
left
it
yonder
behind
the
coppice
at
the
fork
of
the
roads
no
doubt
i
do
not
know
you
i
tell
you
you
have
told
me
that
you
are
the
bishop
but
that
affords
me
no
information
as
to
your
moral
personality
in
short
i
repeat
my
question
who
are
you
you
are
a
bishop
that
is
to
say
a
prince
of
the
church
one
of
those
gilded
men
with
heraldic
bearings
and
revenues
who
have
vast
prebends
the
bishopric
of
d
fifteen
thousand
francs
settled
income
ten
thousand
in
perquisites
total
twenty
five
thousand
francs
who
have
kitchens
who
have
liveries
who
make
good
cheer
who
eat
moor
hens
on
friday
who
strut
about
a
lackey
before
a
lackey
behind
in
a
gala
coach
and
who
have
palaces
and
who
roll
in
their
carriages
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
who
went
barefoot
you
are
a
prelate
revenues
palace
horses
servants
good
table
all
the
sensualities
of
life
you
have
this
like
the
rest
and
like
the
rest
you
enjoy
it
it
is
well
but
this
says
either
too
much
or
too
little
this
does
not
enlighten
me
upon
the
intrinsic
and
essential
value
of
the
man
who
comes
with
the
probable
intention
of
bringing
wisdom
to
me
to
whom
do
i
speak
who
are
you
the
bishop
hung
his
head
and
replied
vermis
sum
i
am
a
worm
a
worm
of
the
earth
in
a
carriage
growled
the
conventionary
it
was
the
conventionary
s
turn
to
be
arrogant
and
the
bishop
s
to
be
humble
the
bishop
resumed
mildly
so
be
it
sir
but
explain
to
me
how
my
carriage
which
is
a
few
paces
off
behind
the
trees
yonder
how
my
good
table
and
the
moor
hens
which
i
eat
on
friday
how
my
twenty
five
thousand
francs
income
how
my
palace
and
my
lackeys
prove
that
clemency
is
not
a
duty
and
that
93
was
not
inexorable
the
conventionary
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
as
though
to
sweep
away
a
cloud
before
replying
to
you
he
said
i
beseech
you
to
pardon
me
i
have
just
committed
a
wrong
sir
you
are
at
my
house
you
are
my
guest
i
owe
you
courtesy
you
discuss
my
ideas
and
it
becomes
me
to
confine
myself
to
combating
your
arguments
your
riches
and
your
pleasures
are
advantages
which
i
hold
over
you
in
the
debate
but
good
taste
dictates
that
i
shall
not
make
use
of
them
i
promise
you
to
make
no
use
of
them
in
the
future
i
thank
you
said
the
bishop
g
resumed
let
us
return
to
the
explanation
which
you
have
asked
of
me
where
were
we
what
were
you
saying
to
me
that
93
was
inexorable
inexorable
yes
said
the
bishop
what
think
you
of
marat
clapping
his
hands
at
the
guillotine
what
think
you
of
bossuet
chanting
the
te
deum
over
the
dragonnades
the
retort
was
a
harsh
one
but
it
attained
its
mark
with
the
directness
of
a
point
of
steel
the
bishop
quivered
under
it
no
reply
occurred
to
him
but
he
was
offended
by
this
mode
of
alluding
to
bossuet
the
best
of
minds
will
have
their
fetiches
and
they
sometimes
feel
vaguely
wounded
by
the
want
of
respect
of
logic
the
conventionary
began
to
pant
the
asthma
of
the
agony
which
is
mingled
with
the
last
breaths
interrupted
his
voice
still
there
was
a
perfect
lucidity
of
soul
in
his
eyes
he
went
on
let
me
say
a
few
words
more
in
this
and
that
direction
i
am
willing
apart
from
the
revolution
which
taken
as
a
whole
is
an
immense
human
affirmation
93
is
alas
a
rejoinder
you
think
it
inexorable
sir
but
what
of
the
whole
monarchy
sir
carrier
is
a
bandit
but
what
name
do
you
give
to
montrevel
fouquier
tainville
is
a
rascal
but
what
is
your
opinion
as
to
lamoignon
baville
maillard
is
terrible
but
saulx
tavannes
if
you
please
duchene
senior
is
ferocious
but
what
epithet
will
you
allow
me
for
the
elder
letellier
jourdan
coupe
tete
is
a
monster
but
not
so
great
a
one
as
m
the
marquis
de
louvois
sir
sir
i
am
sorry
for
marie
antoinette
archduchess
and
queen
but
i
am
also
sorry
for
that
poor
huguenot
woman
who
in
1685
under
louis
the
great
sir
while
with
a
nursing
infant
was
bound
naked
to
the
waist
to
a
stake
and
the
child
kept
at
a
distance
her
breast
swelled
with
milk
and
her
heart
with
anguish
the
little
one
hungry
and
pale
beheld
that
breast
and
cried
and
agonized
the
executioner
said
to
the
woman
a
mother
and
a
nurse
abjure
giving
her
her
choice
between
the
death
of
her
infant
and
the
death
of
her
conscience
what
say
you
to
that
torture
of
tantalus
as
applied
to
a
mother
bear
this
well
in
mind
sir
the
french
revolution
had
its
reasons
for
existence
its
wrath
will
be
absolved
by
the
future
its
result
is
the
world
made
better
from
its
most
terrible
blows
there
comes
forth
a
caress
for
the
human
race
i
abridge
i
stop
i
have
too
much
the
advantage
moreover
i
am
dying
and
ceasing
to
gaze
at
the
bishop
the
conventionary
concluded
his
thoughts
in
these
tranquil
words
yes
the
brutalities
of
progress
are
called
revolutions
when
they
are
over
this
fact
is
recognized
that
the
human
race
has
been
treated
harshly
but
that
it
has
progressed
the
conventionary
doubted
not
that
he
had
successively
conquered
all
the
inmost
intrenchments
of
the
bishop
one
remained
however
and
from
this
intrenchment
the
last
resource
of
monseigneur
bienvenu
s
resistance
came
forth
this
reply
wherein
appeared
nearly
all
the
harshness
of
the
beginning
progress
should
believe
in
god
good
cannot
have
an
impious
servitor
he
who
is
an
atheist
is
but
a
bad
leader
for
the
human
race
the
former
representative
of
the
people
made
no
reply
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
trembling
he
looked
towards
heaven
and
in
his
glance
a
tear
gathered
slowly
when
the
eyelid
was
full
the
tear
trickled
down
his
livid
cheek
and
he
said
almost
in
a
stammer
quite
low
and
to
himself
while
his
eyes
were
plunged
in
the
depths
o
thou
o
ideal
thou
alone
existest
the
bishop
experienced
an
indescribable
shock
after
a
pause
the
old
man
raised
a
finger
heavenward
and
said
the
infinite
is
he
is
there
if
the
infinite
had
no
person
person
would
be
without
limit
it
would
not
be
infinite
in
other
words
it
would
not
exist
there
is
then
an
i
that
i
of
the
infinite
is
god
the
dying
man
had
pronounced
these
last
words
in
a
loud
voice
and
with
the
shiver
of
ecstasy
as
though
he
beheld
some
one
when
he
had
spoken
his
eyes
closed
the
effort
had
exhausted
him
it
was
evident
that
he
had
just
lived
through
in
a
moment
the
few
hours
which
had
been
left
to
him
that
which
he
had
said
brought
him
nearer
to
him
who
is
in
death
the
supreme
moment
was
approaching
the
bishop
understood
this
time
pressed
it
was
as
a
priest
that
he
had
come
from
extreme
coldness
he
had
passed
by
degrees
to
extreme
emotion
he
gazed
at
those
closed
eyes
he
took
that
wrinkled
aged
and
ice
cold
hand
in
his
and
bent
over
the
dying
man
this
hour
is
the
hour
of
god
do
you
not
think
that
it
would
be
regrettable
if
we
had
met
in
vain
the
conventionary
opened
his
eyes
again
a
gravity
mingled
with
gloom
was
imprinted
on
his
countenance
bishop
said
he
with
a
slowness
which
probably
arose
more
from
his
dignity
of
soul
than
from
the
failing
of
his
strength
i
have
passed
my
life
in
meditation
study
and
contemplation
i
was
sixty
years
of
age
when
my
country
called
me
and
commanded
me
to
concern
myself
with
its
affairs
i
obeyed
abuses
existed
i
combated
them
tyrannies
existed
i
destroyed
them
rights
and
principles
existed
i
proclaimed
and
confessed
them
our
territory
was
invaded
i
defended
it
france
was
menaced
i
offered
my
breast
i
was
not
rich
i
am
poor
i
have
been
one
of
the
masters
of
the
state
the
vaults
of
the
treasury
were
encumbered
with
specie
to
such
a
degree
that
we
were
forced
to
shore
up
the
walls
which
were
on
the
point
of
bursting
beneath
the
weight
of
gold
and
silver
i
dined
in
dead
tree
street
at
twenty
two
sous
i
have
succored
the
oppressed
i
have
comforted
the
suffering
i
tore
the
cloth
from
the
altar
it
is
true
but
it
was
to
bind
up
the
wounds
of
my
country
i
have
always
upheld
the
march
forward
of
the
human
race
forward
towards
the
light
and
i
have
sometimes
resisted
progress
without
pity
i
have
when
the
occasion
offered
protected
my
own
adversaries
men
of
your
profession
and
there
is
at
peteghem
in
flanders
at
the
very
spot
where
the
merovingian
kings
had
their
summer
palace
a
convent
of
urbanists
the
abbey
of
sainte
claire
en
beaulieu
which
i
saved
in
1793
i
have
done
my
duty
according
to
my
powers
and
all
the
good
that
i
was
able
after
which
i
was
hunted
down
pursued
persecuted
blackened
jeered
at
scorned
cursed
proscribed
for
many
years
past
i
with
my
white
hair
have
been
conscious
that
many
people
think
they
have
the
right
to
despise
me
to
the
poor
ignorant
masses
i
present
the
visage
of
one
damned
and
i
accept
this
isolation
of
hatred
without
hating
any
one
myself
now
i
am
eighty
six
years
old
i
am
on
the
point
of
death
what
is
it
that
you
have
come
to
ask
of
me
your
blessing
said
the
bishop
and
he
knelt
down
when
the
bishop
raised
his
head
again
the
face
of
the
conventionary
had
become
august
he
had
just
expired
the
bishop
returned
home
deeply
absorbed
in
thoughts
which
cannot
be
known
to
us
he
passed
the
whole
night
in
prayer
on
the
following
morning
some
bold
and
curious
persons
attempted
to
speak
to
him
about
member
of
the
convention
g
he
contented
himself
with
pointing
heavenward
from
that
moment
he
redoubled
his
tenderness
and
brotherly
feeling
towards
all
children
and
sufferers
any
allusion
to
that
old
wretch
of
a
g
caused
him
to
fall
into
a
singular
preoccupation
no
one
could
say
that
the
passage
of
that
soul
before
his
and
the
reflection
of
that
grand
conscience
upon
his
did
not
count
for
something
in
his
approach
to
perfection
this
pastoral
visit
naturally
furnished
an
occasion
for
a
murmur
of
comment
in
all
the
little
local
coteries
was
the
bedside
of
such
a
dying
man
as
that
the
proper
place
for
a
bishop
there
was
evidently
no
conversion
to
be
expected
all
those
revolutionists
are
backsliders
then
why
go
there
what
was
there
to
be
seen
there
he
must
have
been
very
curious
indeed
to
see
a
soul
carried
off
by
the
devil
one
day
a
dowager
of
the
impertinent
variety
who
thinks
herself
spiritual
addressed
this
sally
to
him
monseigneur
people
are
inquiring
when
your
greatness
will
receive
the
red
cap
oh
oh
that
s
a
coarse
color
replied
the
bishop
it
is
lucky
that
those
who
despise
it
in
a
cap
revere
it
in
a
hat
chapter
xi
a
restriction
we
should
incur
a
great
risk
of
deceiving
ourselves
were
we
to
conclude
from
this
that
monseigneur
welcome
was
a
philosophical
bishop
or
a
patriotic
cure
his
meeting
which
may
almost
be
designated
as
his
union
with
conventionary
g
left
behind
it
in
his
mind
a
sort
of
astonishment
which
rendered
him
still
more
gentle
that
is
all
although
monseigneur
bienvenu
was
far
from
being
a
politician
this
is
perhaps
the
place
to
indicate
very
briefly
what
his
attitude
was
in
the
events
of
that
epoch
supposing
that
monseigneur
bienvenu
ever
dreamed
of
having
an
attitude
let
us
then
go
back
a
few
years
some
time
after
the
elevation
of
m
myriel
to
the
episcopate
the
emperor
had
made
him
a
baron
of
the
empire
in
company
with
many
other
bishops
the
arrest
of
the
pope
took
place
as
every
one
knows
on
the
night
of
the
5th
to
the
6th
of
july
1809
on
this
occasion
m
myriel
was
summoned
by
napoleon
to
the
synod
of
the
bishops
of
france
and
italy
convened
at
paris
this
synod
was
held
at
notre
dame
and
assembled
for
the
first
time
on
the
15th
of
june
1811
under
the
presidency
of
cardinal
fesch
m
myriel
was
one
of
the
ninety
five
bishops
who
attended
it
but
he
was
present
only
at
one
sitting
and
at
three
or
four
private
conferences
bishop
of
a
mountain
diocese
living
so
very
close
to
nature
in
rusticity
and
deprivation
it
appeared
that
he
imported
among
these
eminent
personages
ideas
which
altered
the
temperature
of
the
assembly
he
very
soon
returned
to
d
he
was
interrogated
as
to
this
speedy
return
and
he
replied
i
embarrassed
them
the
outside
air
penetrated
to
them
through
me
i
produced
on
them
the
effect
of
an
open
door
on
another
occasion
he
said
what
would
you
have
those
gentlemen
are
princes
i
am
only
a
poor
peasant
bishop
the
fact
is
that
he
displeased
them
among
other
strange
things
it
is
said
that
he
chanced
to
remark
one
evening
when
he
found
himself
at
the
house
of
one
of
his
most
notable
colleagues
what
beautiful
clocks
what
beautiful
carpets
what
beautiful
liveries
they
must
be
a
great
trouble
i
would
not
have
all
those
superfluities
crying
incessantly
in
my
ears
there
are
people
who
are
hungry
there
are
people
who
are
cold
there
are
poor
people
there
are
poor
people
let
us
remark
by
the
way
that
the
hatred
of
luxury
is
not
an
intelligent
hatred
this
hatred
would
involve
the
hatred
of
the
arts
nevertheless
in
churchmen
luxury
is
wrong
except
in
connection
with
representations
and
ceremonies
it
seems
to
reveal
habits
which
have
very
little
that
is
charitable
about
them
an
opulent
priest
is
a
contradiction
the
priest
must
keep
close
to
the
poor
now
can
one
come
in
contact
incessantly
night
and
day
with
all
this
distress
all
these
misfortunes
and
this
poverty
without
having
about
one
s
own
person
a
little
of
that
misery
like
the
dust
of
labor
is
it
possible
to
imagine
a
man
near
a
brazier
who
is
not
warm
can
one
imagine
a
workman
who
is
working
near
a
furnace
and
who
has
neither
a
singed
hair
nor
blackened
nails
nor
a
drop
of
sweat
nor
a
speck
of
ashes
on
his
face
the
first
proof
of
charity
in
the
priest
in
the
bishop
especially
is
poverty
this
is
no
doubt
what
the
bishop
of
d
thought
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
he
shared
what
we
call
the
ideas
of
the
century
on
certain
delicate
points
he
took
very
little
part
in
the
theological
quarrels
of
the
moment
and
maintained
silence
on
questions
in
which
church
and
state
were
implicated
but
if
he
had
been
strongly
pressed
it
seems
that
he
would
have
been
found
to
be
an
ultramontane
rather
than
a
gallican
since
we
are
making
a
portrait
and
since
we
do
not
wish
to
conceal
anything
we
are
forced
to
add
that
he
was
glacial
towards
napoleon
in
his
decline
beginning
with
1813
he
gave
in
his
adherence
to
or
applauded
all
hostile
manifestations
he
refused
to
see
him
as
he
passed
through
on
his
return
from
the
island
of
elba
and
he
abstained
from
ordering
public
prayers
for
the
emperor
in
his
diocese
during
the
hundred
days
besides
his
sister
mademoiselle
baptistine
he
had
two
brothers
one
a
general
the
other
a
prefect
he
wrote
to
both
with
tolerable
frequency
he
was
harsh
for
a
time
towards
the
former
because
holding
a
command
in
provence
at
the
epoch
of
the
disembarkation
at
cannes
the
general
had
put
himself
at
the
head
of
twelve
hundred
men
and
had
pursued
the
emperor
as
though
the
latter
had
been
a
person
whom
one
is
desirous
of
allowing
to
escape
his
correspondence
with
the
other
brother
the
ex
prefect
a
fine
worthy
man
who
lived
in
retirement
at
paris
rue
cassette
remained
more
affectionate
thus
monseigneur
bienvenu
also
had
his
hour
of
party
spirit
his
hour
of
bitterness
his
cloud
the
shadow
of
the
passions
of
the
moment
traversed
this
grand
and
gentle
spirit
occupied
with
eternal
things
certainly
such
a
man
would
have
done
well
not
to
entertain
any
political
opinions
let
there
be
no
mistake
as
to
our
meaning
we
are
not
confounding
what
is
called
political
opinions
with
the
grand
aspiration
for
progress
with
the
sublime
faith
patriotic
democratic
humane
which
in
our
day
should
be
the
very
foundation
of
every
generous
intellect
without
going
deeply
into
questions
which
are
only
indirectly
connected
with
the
subject
of
this
book
we
will
simply
say
this
it
would
have
been
well
if
monseigneur
bienvenu
had
not
been
a
royalist
and
if
his
glance
had
never
been
for
a
single
instant
turned
away
from
that
serene
contemplation
in
which
is
distinctly
discernible
above
the
fictions
and
the
hatreds
of
this
world
above
the
stormy
vicissitudes
of
human
things
the
beaming
of
those
three
pure
radiances
truth
justice
and
charity
while
admitting
that
it
was
not
for
a
political
office
that
god
created
monseigneur
welcome
we
should
have
understood
and
admired
his
protest
in
the
name
of
right
and
liberty
his
proud
opposition
his
just
but
perilous
resistance
to
the
all
powerful
napoleon
but
that
which
pleases
us
in
people
who
are
rising
pleases
us
less
in
the
case
of
people
who
are
falling
we
only
love
the
fray
so
long
as
there
is
danger
and
in
any
case
the
combatants
of
the
first
hour
have
alone
the
right
to
be
the
exterminators
of
the
last
he
who
has
not
been
a
stubborn
accuser
in
prosperity
should
hold
his
peace
in
the
face
of
ruin
the
denunciator
of
success
is
the
only
legitimate
executioner
of
the
fall
as
for
us
when
providence
intervenes
and
strikes
we
let
it
work
1812
commenced
to
disarm
us
in
1813
the
cowardly
breach
of
silence
of
that
taciturn
legislative
body
emboldened
by
catastrophe
possessed
only
traits
which
aroused
indignation
and
it
was
a
crime
to
applaud
in
1814
in
the
presence
of
those
marshals
who
betrayed
in
the
presence
of
that
senate
which
passed
from
one
dunghill
to
another
insulting
after
having
deified
in
the
presence
of
that
idolatry
which
was
loosing
its
footing
and
spitting
on
its
idol
it
was
a
duty
to
turn
aside
the
head
in
1815
when
the
supreme
disasters
filled
the
air
when
france
was
seized
with
a
shiver
at
their
sinister
approach
when
waterloo
could
be
dimly
discerned
opening
before
napoleon
the
mournful
acclamation
of
the
army
and
the
people
to
the
condemned
of
destiny
had
nothing
laughable
in
it
and
after
making
all
allowance
for
the
despot
a
heart
like
that
of
the
bishop
of
d
ought
not
perhaps
to
have
failed
to
recognize
the
august
and
touching
features
presented
by
the
embrace
of
a
great
nation
and
a
great
man
on
the
brink
of
the
abyss
with
this
exception
he
was
in
all
things
just
true
equitable
intelligent
humble
and
dignified
beneficent
and
kindly
which
is
only
another
sort
of
benevolence
he
was
a
priest
a
sage
and
a
man
it
must
be
admitted
that
even
in
the
political
views
with
which
we
have
just
reproached
him
and
which
we
are
disposed
to
judge
almost
with
severity
he
was
tolerant
and
easy
more
so
perhaps
than
we
who
are
speaking
here
the
porter
of
the
town
hall
had
been
placed
there
by
the
emperor
he
was
an
old
non
commissioned
officer
of
the
old
guard
a
member
of
the
legion
of
honor
at
austerlitz
as
much
of
a
bonapartist
as
the
eagle
this
poor
fellow
occasionally
let
slip
inconsiderate
remarks
which
the
law
then
stigmatized
as
seditious
speeches
after
the
imperial
profile
disappeared
from
the
legion
of
honor
he
never
dressed
himself
in
his
regimentals
as
he
said
so
that
he
should
not
be
obliged
to
wear
his
cross
he
had
himself
devoutly
removed
the
imperial
effigy
from
the
cross
which
napoleon
had
given
him
this
made
a
hole
and
he
would
not
put
anything
in
its
place
i
will
die
he
said
rather
than
wear
the
three
frogs
upon
my
heart
he
liked
to
scoff
aloud
at
louis
xviii
the
gouty
old
creature
in
english
gaiters
he
said
let
him
take
himself
off
to
prussia
with
that
queue
of
his
he
was
happy
to
combine
in
the
same
imprecation
the
two
things
which
he
most
detested
prussia
and
england
he
did
it
so
often
that
he
lost
his
place
there
he
was
turned
out
of
the
house
with
his
wife
and
children
and
without
bread
the
bishop
sent
for
him
reproved
him
gently
and
appointed
him
beadle
in
the
cathedral
in
the
course
of
nine
years
monseigneur
bienvenu
had
by
dint
of
holy
deeds
and
gentle
manners
filled
the
town
of
d
with
a
sort
of
tender
and
filial
reverence
even
his
conduct
towards
napoleon
had
been
accepted
and
tacitly
pardoned
as
it
were
by
the
people
the
good
and
weakly
flock
who
adored
their
emperor
but
loved
their
bishop

the

a

is
almost
always
surrounded
by
a

every

has
about

his

from

which
goes

round
and
maintains
good
order
in
the
episcopal
palace
and
mounts
guard
over
monseigneur
s
smile
to
please
a
bishop
is
equivalent
to
getting
one

in
the
stirrup
for
a
sub

it
is
necessary
to
walk

discreetly
the
apostleship
does
not
disdain
the
canonship
just
as
there
are
bigwigs
elsewhere
there
are

these
are
the

at

are
rich
well
endowed
skilful
accepted
by
the
world
who
know
how
to
pray
no

who
know
also
how
to
beg
who
feel
little
scruple
at
making

a
gleam
of

poor
humble
retiring
was
not
accounted
among

this
was
plain
from
the
complete
absence
of
young

about
him
we
have
seen
that
he
did
not

a

committed
the
folly
of
putting
forth
its

in

his
canons

were
good

rather
vulgar
like
himself
walled
up
like
him
in

diocese
without
exit
to

who
resembled
their
bishop
with
this
difference
that
they
were
finished
and
he
was
completed
the
impossibility
of
growing
great
under
monseigneur

was
so
well
understood
that
no

had
the
young
men
whom
he
ordained
left
the
seminary
than
they
got
themselves
recommended
to
the
archbishops
of

of

went
off
in

great
hurry

in

we
repeat
it

a

incurable
poverty
an
anchylosis
of
the
joints
which
are
useful
in
advancement
and
in
short
more
renunciation
than
you
desire

this

avoided

of

chapter
xiii
what
he
believed
we
are
not
obliged
to
sound
the
bishop
of
d
on
the
score
of
orthodoxy
in
the
presence
of
such
a
soul
we
feel
ourselves
in
no
mood
but
respect
the
conscience
of
the
just
man
should
be
accepted
on
his
word
moreover
certain
natures
being
given
we
admit
the
possible
development
of
all
beauties
of
human
virtue
in
a
belief
that
differs
from
our
own
what
did
he
think
of
this
dogma
or
of
that
mystery
these
secrets
of
the
inner
tribunal
of
the
conscience
are
known
only
to
the
tomb
where
souls
enter
naked
the
point
on
which
we
are
certain
is
that
the
difficulties
of
faith
never
resolved
themselves
into
hypocrisy
in
his
case
no
decay
is
possible
to
the
diamond
he
believed
to
the
extent
of
his
powers
credo
in
patrem
he
often
exclaimed
moreover
he
drew
from
good
works
that
amount
of
satisfaction
which
suffices
to
the
conscience
and
which
whispers
to
a
man
thou
art
with
god
the
point
which
we
consider
it
our
duty
to
note
is
that
outside
of
and
beyond
his
faith
as
it
were
the
bishop
possessed
an
excess
of
love
it
was
in
that
quarter
quia
multum
amavit
because
he
loved
much
that
he
was
regarded
as
vulnerable
by
serious
men
grave
persons
and
reasonable
people
favorite
locutions
of
our
sad
world
where
egotism
takes
its
word
of
command
from
pedantry
what
was
this
excess
of
love
it
was
a
serene
benevolence
which
overflowed
men
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
and
which
on
occasion
extended
even
to
things
he
lived
without
disdain
he
was
indulgent
towards
god
s
creation
every
man
even
the
best
has
within
him
a
thoughtless
harshness
which
he
reserves
for
animals
the
bishop
of
d
had
none
of
that
harshness
which
is
peculiar
to
many
priests
nevertheless
he
did
not
go
as
far
as
the
brahmin
but
he
seemed
to
have
weighed
this
saying
of
ecclesiastes
who
knoweth
whither
the
soul
of
the
animal
goeth
hideousness
of
aspect
deformity
of
instinct
troubled
him
not
and
did
not
arouse
his
indignation
he
was
touched
almost
softened
by
them
it
seemed
as
though
he
went
thoughtfully
away
to
seek
beyond
the
bounds
of
life
which
is
apparent
the
cause
the
explanation
or
the
excuse
for
them
he
seemed
at
times
to
be
asking
god
to
commute
these
penalties
he
examined
without
wrath
and
with
the
eye
of
a
linguist
who
is
deciphering
a
palimpsest
that
portion
of
chaos
which
still
exists
in
nature
this
revery
sometimes
caused
him
to
utter
odd
sayings
one
morning
he
was
in
his
garden
and
thought
himself
alone
but
his
sister
was
walking
behind
him
unseen
by
him
suddenly
he
paused
and
gazed
at
something
on
the
ground
it
was
a
large
black
hairy
frightful
spider
his
sister
heard
him
say
poor
beast
it
is
not
its
fault
why
not
mention
these
almost
divinely
childish
sayings
of
kindness
puerile
they
may
be
but
these
sublime
puerilities
were
peculiar
to
saint
francis
d
assisi
and
of
marcus
aurelius
one
day
he
sprained
his
ankle
in
his
effort
to
avoid
stepping
on
an
ant
thus
lived
this
just
man
sometimes
he
fell
asleep
in
his
garden
and
then
there
was
nothing
more
venerable
possible
monseigneur
bienvenu
had
formerly
been
if
the
stories
anent
his
youth
and
even
in
regard
to
his
manhood
were
to
be
believed
a
passionate
and
possibly
a
violent
man
his
universal
suavity
was
less
an
instinct
of
nature
than
the
result
of
a
grand
conviction
which
had
filtered
into
his
heart
through
the
medium
of
life
and
had
trickled
there
slowly
thought
by
thought
for
in
a
character
as
in
a
rock
there
may
exist
apertures
made
by
drops
of
water
these
hollows
are
uneffaceable
these
formations
are
indestructible
in
1815
as
we
think
we
have
already
said
he
reached
his
seventy
fifth
birthday
but
he
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
sixty
he
was
not
tall
he
was
rather
plump
and
in
order
to
combat
this
tendency
he
was
fond
of
taking
long
strolls
on
foot
his
step
was
firm
and
his
form
was
but
slightly
bent
a
detail
from
which
we
do
not
pretend
to
draw
any
conclusion
gregory
xvi
at
the
age
of
eighty
held
himself
erect
and
smiling
which
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
a
bad
bishop
monseigneur
welcome
had
what
the
people
term
a
fine
head
but
so
amiable
was
he
that
they
forgot
that
it
was
fine
when
he
conversed
with
that
infantile
gayety
which
was
one
of
his
charms
and
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
people
felt
at
their
ease
with
him
and
joy
seemed
to
radiate
from
his
whole
person
his
fresh
and
ruddy
complexion
his
very
white
teeth
all
of
which
he
had
preserved
and
which
were
displayed
by
his
smile
gave
him
that
open
and
easy
air
which
cause
the
remark
to
be
made
of
a
man
he
s
a
good
fellow
and
of
an
old
man
he
is
a
fine
man
that
it
will
be
recalled
was
the
effect
which
he
produced
upon
napoleon
on
the
first
encounter
and
to
one
who
saw
him
for
the
first
time
he
was
nothing
in
fact
but
a
fine
man
but
if
one
remained
near
him
for
a
few
hours
and
beheld
him
in
the
least
degree
pensive
the
fine
man
became
gradually
transfigured
and
took
on
some
imposing
quality
i
know
not
what
his
broad
and
serious
brow
rendered
august
by
his
white
locks
became
august
also
by
virtue
of
meditation
majesty
radiated
from
his
goodness
though
his
goodness
ceased
not
to
be
radiant
one
experienced
something
of
the
emotion
which
one
would
feel
on
beholding
a
smiling
angel
slowly
unfold
his
wings
without
ceasing
to
smile
respect
an
unutterable
respect
penetrated
you
by
degrees
and
mounted
to
your
heart
and
one
felt
that
one
had
before
him
one
of
those
strong
thoroughly
tried
and
indulgent
souls
where
thought
is
so
grand
that
it
can
no
longer
be
anything
but
gentle
as
we
have
seen
prayer
the
celebration
of
the
offices
of
religion
alms
giving
the
consolation
of
the
afflicted
the
cultivation
of
a
bit
of
land
fraternity
frugality
hospitality
renunciation
confidence
study
work
filled
every
day
of
his
life
filled
is
exactly
the
word
certainly
the
bishop
s
day
was
quite
full
to
the
brim
of
good
words
and
good
deeds
nevertheless
it
was
not
complete
if
cold
or
rainy
weather
prevented
his
passing
an
hour
or
two
in
his
garden
before
going
to
bed
and
after
the
two
women
had
retired
it
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
rite
with
him
to
prepare
himself
for
slumber
by
meditation
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
spectacles
of
the
nocturnal
heavens
sometimes
if
the
two
old
women
were
not
asleep
they
heard
him
pacing
slowly
along
the
walks
at
a
very
advanced
hour
of
the
night
he
was
there
alone
communing
with
himself
peaceful
adoring
comparing
the
serenity
of
his
heart
with
the
serenity
of
the
ether
moved
amid
the
darkness
by
the
visible
splendor
of
the
constellations
and
the
invisible
splendor
of
god
opening
his
heart
to
the
thoughts
which
fall
from
the
unknown
at
such
moments
while
he
offered
his
heart
at
the
hour
when
nocturnal
flowers
offer
their
perfume
illuminated
like
a
lamp
amid
the
starry
night
as
he
poured
himself
out
in
ecstasy
in
the
midst
of
the
universal
radiance
of
creation
he
could
not
have
told
himself
probably
what
was
passing
in
his
spirit
he
felt
something
take
its
flight
from
him
and
something
descend
into
him
mysterious
exchange
of
the
abysses
of
the
soul
with
the
abysses
of
the
universe
he
thought
of
the
grandeur
and
presence
of
god
of
the
future
eternity
that
strange
mystery
of
the
eternity
past
a
mystery
still
more
strange
of
all
the
infinities
which
pierced
their
way
into
all
his
senses
beneath
his
eyes
and
without
seeking
to
comprehend
the
incomprehensible
he
gazed
upon
it
he
did
not
study
god
he
was
dazzled
by
him
he
considered
those
magnificent
conjunctions
of
atoms
which
communicate
aspects
to
matter
reveal
forces
by
verifying
them
create
individualities
in
unity
proportions
in
extent
the
innumerable
in
the
infinite
and
through
light
produce
beauty
these
conjunctions
are
formed
and
dissolved
incessantly
hence
life
and
death
he
seated
himself
on
a
wooden
bench
with
his
back
against
a
decrepit
vine
he
gazed
at
the
stars
past
the
puny
and
stunted
silhouettes
of
his
fruit
trees
this
quarter
of
an
acre
so
poorly
planted
so
encumbered
with
mean
buildings
and
sheds
was
dear
to
him
and
satisfied
his
wants
what
more
was
needed
by
this
old
man
who
divided
the
leisure
of
his
life
where
there
was
so
little
leisure
between
gardening
in
the
daytime
and
contemplation
at
night
was
not
this
narrow
enclosure
with
the
heavens
for
a
ceiling
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
adore
god
in
his
most
divine
works
in
turn
does
not
this
comprehend
all
in
fact
and
what
is
there
left
to
desire
beyond
it
a
little
garden
in
which
to
walk
and
immensity
in
which
to
dream
at
one
s
feet
that
which
can
be
cultivated
and
plucked
over
head
that
which
one
can
study
and
meditate
upon
some
flowers
on
earth
and
all
the
stars
in
the
sky
chapter
xiv
what
he
thought
one
last
word
since
this
sort
of
details
might
particularly
at
the
present
moment
and
to
use
an
expression
now
in
fashion
give
to
the
bishop
of
d
a
certain
pantheistical
physiognomy
and
induce
the
belief
either
to
his
credit
or
discredit
that
he
entertained
one
of
those
personal
philosophies
which
are
peculiar
to
our
century
which
sometimes
spring
up
in
solitary
spirits
and
there
take
on
a
form
and
grow
until
they
usurp
the
place
of
religion
we
insist
upon
it
that
not
one
of
those
persons
who
knew
monseigneur
welcome
would
have
thought
himself
authorized
to
think
anything
of
the
sort
that
which
enlightened
this
man
was
his
heart
his
wisdom
was
made
of
the
light
which
comes
from
there
no
systems
many
works
abstruse
speculations
contain
vertigo
no
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
risked
his
mind
in
apocalypses
the
apostle
may
be
daring
but
the
bishop
must
be
timid
he
would
probably
have
felt
a
scruple
at
sounding
too
far
in
advance
certain
problems
which
are
in
a
manner
reserved
for
terrible
great
minds
there
is
a
sacred
horror
beneath
the
porches
of
the
enigma
those
gloomy
openings
stand
yawning
there
but
something
tells
you
you
a
passer
by
in
life
that
you
must
not
enter
woe
to
him
who
penetrates
thither
geniuses
in
the
impenetrable
depths
of
abstraction
and
pure
speculation
situated
so
to
speak
above
all
dogmas
propose
their
ideas
to
god
their
prayer
audaciously
offers
discussion
their
adoration
interrogates
this
is
direct
religion
which
is
full
of
anxiety
and
responsibility
for
him
who
attempts
its
steep
cliffs
human
meditation
has
no
limits
at
his
own
risk
and
peril
it
analyzes
and
digs
deep
into
its
own
bedazzlement
one
might
almost
say
that
by
a
sort
of
splendid
reaction
it
with
it
dazzles
nature
the
mysterious
world
which
surrounds
us
renders
back
what
it
has
received
it
is
probable
that
the
contemplators
are
contemplated
however
that
may
be
there
are
on
earth
men
who
are
they
men
perceive
distinctly
at
the
verge
of
the
horizons
of
revery
the
heights
of
the
absolute
and
who
have
the
terrible
vision
of
the
infinite
mountain
monseigneur
welcome
was
one
of
these
men
monseigneur
welcome
was
not
a
genius
he
would
have
feared
those
sublimities
whence
some
very
great
men
even
like
swedenborg
and
pascal
have
slipped
into
insanity
certainly
these
powerful
reveries
have
their
moral
utility
and
by
these
arduous
paths
one
approaches
to
ideal
perfection
as
for
him
he
took
the
path
which
shortens
the
gospel
s
he
did
not
attempt
to
impart
to
his
chasuble
the
folds
of
elijah
s
mantle
he
projected
no
ray
of
future
upon
the
dark
groundswell
of
events
he
did
not
seek
to
condense
in
flame
the
light
of
things
he
had
nothing
of
the
prophet
and
nothing
of
the
magician
about
him
this
humble
soul
loved
and
that
was
all
that
he
carried
prayer
to
the
pitch
of
a
superhuman
aspiration
is
probable
but
one
can
no
more
pray
too
much
than
one
can
love
too
much
and
if
it
is
a
heresy
to
pray
beyond
the

i
the
evening
of
a
day
of
walking
early
in
the
month
of
october
1815
about
an
hour
before
sunset
a
man
who
was
travelling
on
foot
entered
the
little
town
of
d
the
few
inhabitants
who
were
at
their
windows
or
on
their
thresholds
at
the
moment
stared
at
this
traveller
with
a
sort
of
uneasiness
it
was
difficult
to
encounter
a
wayfarer
of
more
wretched
appearance
he
was
a
man
of
medium
stature
thickset
and
robust
in
the
prime
of
life
he
might
have
been
forty
six
or
forty
eight
years
old
a
cap
with
a
drooping
leather
visor
partly
concealed
his
face
burned
and
tanned
by
sun
and
wind
and
dripping
with
perspiration
his
shirt
of
coarse
yellow
linen
fastened
at
the
neck
by
a
small
silver
anchor
permitted
a
view
of
his
hairy
breast
he
had
a
cravat
twisted
into
a
string
trousers
of
blue
drilling
worn
and
threadbare
white
on
one
knee
and
torn
on
the
other
an
old
gray
tattered
blouse
patched
on
one
of
the
elbows
with
a
bit
of
green
cloth
sewed
on
with
twine
a
tightly
packed
soldier
knapsack
well
buckled
and
perfectly
new
on
his
back
an
enormous
knotty
stick
in
his
hand
iron
shod
shoes
on
his
stockingless
feet
a
shaved
head
and
a
long
beard
the
sweat
the
heat
the
journey
on
foot
the
dust
added
i
know
not
what
sordid
quality
to
this
dilapidated
whole
his
hair
was
closely
cut
yet
bristling
for
it
had
begun
to
grow
a
little
and
did
not
seem
to
have
been
cut
for
some
time
no
one
knew
him
he
was
evidently
only
a
chance
passer
by
whence
came
he
from
the
south
from
the
seashore
perhaps
for
he
made
his
entrance
into
d
by
the
same
street
which
seven
months
previously
had
witnessed
the
passage
of
the
emperor
napoleon
on
his
way
from
cannes
to
paris
this
man
must
have
been
walking
all
day
he
seemed
very
much
fatigued
some
women
of
the
ancient
market
town
which
is
situated
below
the
city
had
seen
him
pause
beneath
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
gassendi
and
drink
at
the
fountain
which
stands
at
the
end
of
the
promenade
he
must
have
been
very
thirsty
for
the
children
who
followed
him
saw
him
stop
again
for
a
drink
two
hundred
paces
further
on
at
the
fountain
in
the
market
place
on
arriving
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
poichevert
he
turned
to
the
left
and
directed
his
steps
toward
the
town
hall
he
entered
then
came
out
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
a
gendarme
was
seated
near
the
door
on
the
stone
bench
which
general
drouot
had
mounted
on
the
4th
of
march
to
read
to
the
frightened
throng
of
the
inhabitants
of
d
the
proclamation
of
the
gulf
juan
the
man
pulled
off
his
cap
and
humbly
saluted
the
gendarme
the
gendarme
without
replying
to
his
salute
stared
attentively
at
him
followed
him
for
a
while
with
his
eyes
and
then
entered
the
town
hall
there
then
existed
at
d
a
fine
inn
at
the
sign
of
the
cross
of
colbas
this
inn
had
for
a
landlord
a
certain
jacquin
labarre
a
man
of
consideration
in
the
town
on
account
of
his
relationship
to
another
labarre
who
kept
the
inn
of
the
three
dauphins
in
grenoble
and
had
served
in
the
guides
at
the
time
of
the
emperor
s
landing
many
rumors
had
circulated
throughout
the
country
with
regard
to
this
inn
of
the
three
dauphins
it
was
said
that
general
bertrand
disguised
as
a
carter
had
made
frequent
trips
thither
in
the
month
of
january
and
that
he
had
distributed
crosses
of
honor
to
the
soldiers
and
handfuls
of
gold
to
the
citizens
the
truth
is
that
when
the
emperor
entered
grenoble
he
had
refused
to
install
himself
at
the
hotel
of
the
prefecture
he
had
thanked
the
mayor
saying
i
am
going
to
the
house
of
a
brave
man
of
my
acquaintance
and
he
had
betaken
himself
to
the
three
dauphins
this
glory
of
the
labarre
of
the
three
dauphins
was
reflected
upon
the
labarre
of
the
cross
of
colbas
at
a
distance
of
five
and
twenty
leagues
it
was
said
of
him
in
the
town
that
is
the
cousin
of
the
man
of
grenoble
the
man
bent
his
steps
towards
this
inn
which
was
the
best
in
the
country
side
he
entered
the
kitchen
which
opened
on
a
level
with
the
street
all
the
stoves
were
lighted
a
huge
fire
blazed
gayly
in
the
fireplace
the
host
who
was
also
the
chief
cook
was
going
from
one
stew
pan
to
another
very
busily
superintending
an
excellent
dinner
designed
for
the
wagoners
whose
loud
talking
conversation
and
laughter
were
audible
from
an
adjoining
apartment
any
one
who
has
travelled
knows
that
there
is
no
one
who
indulges
in
better
cheer
than
wagoners
a
fat
marmot
flanked
by
white
partridges
and
heather
cocks
was
turning
on
a
long
spit
before
the
fire
on
the
stove
two
huge
carps
from
lake
lauzet
and
a
trout
from
lake
alloz
were
cooking
the
host
hearing
the
door
open
and
seeing
a
newcomer
enter
said
without
raising
his
eyes
from
his
stoves
what
do
you
wish
sir
food
and
lodging
said
the
man
nothing
easier
replied
the
host
at
that
moment
he
turned
his
head
took
in
the
traveller
s
appearance
with
a
single
glance
and
added
by
paying
for
it
the
man
drew
a
large
leather
purse
from
the
pocket
of
his
blouse
and
answered
i
have
money
in
that
case
we
are
at
your
service
said
the
host
the
man
put
his
purse
back
in
his
pocket
removed
his
knapsack
from
his
back
put
it
on
the
ground
near
the
door
retained
his
stick
in
his
hand
and
seated
himself
on
a
low
stool
close
to
the
fire
d
is
in
the
mountains
the
evenings
are
cold
there
in
october
but
as
the
host
went
back
and
forth
he
scrutinized
the
traveller
will
dinner
be
ready
soon
said
the
man
immediately
replied
the
landlord
while
the
newcomer
was
warming
himself
before
the
fire
with
his
back
turned
the
worthy
host
jacquin
labarre
drew
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
then
tore
off
the
corner
of
an
old
newspaper
which
was
lying
on
a
small
table
near
the
window
on
the
white
margin
he
wrote
a
line
or
two
folded
it
without
sealing
and
then
intrusted
this
scrap
of
paper
to
a
child
who
seemed
to
serve
him
in
the
capacity
both
of
scullion
and
lackey
the
landlord
whispered
a
word
in
the
scullion
s
ear
and
the
child
set
off
on
a
run
in
the
direction
of
the
town
hall
the
traveller
saw
nothing
of
all
this
once
more
he
inquired
will
dinner
be
ready
soon
immediately
responded
the
host
the
child
returned
he
brought
back
the
paper
the
host
unfolded
it
eagerly
like
a
person
who
is
expecting
a
reply
he
seemed
to
read
it
attentively
then
tossed
his
head
and
remained
thoughtful
for
a
moment
then
he
took
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
traveller
who
appeared
to
be
immersed
in
reflections
which
were
not
very
serene
i
cannot
receive
you
sir
said
he
the
man
half
rose
what
are
you
afraid
that
i
will
not
pay
you
do
you
want
me
to
pay
you
in
advance
i
have
money
i
tell
you
it
is
not
that
what
then
you
have
money
yes
said
the
man
and
i
said
the
host
have
no
room
the
man
resumed
tranquilly
put
me
in
the
stable
i
cannot
why
the
horses
take
up
all
the
space
very
well
retorted
the
man
a
corner
of
the
loft
then
a
truss
of
straw
we
will
see
about
that
after
dinner
i
cannot
give
you
any
dinner
this
declaration
made
in
a
measured
but
firm
tone
struck
the
stranger
as
grave
he
rose
ah
bah
but
i
am
dying
of
hunger
i
have
been
walking
since
sunrise
i
have
travelled
twelve
leagues
i
pay
i
wish
to
eat
i
have
nothing
said
the
landlord
the
man
burst
out
laughing
and
turned
towards
the
fireplace
and
the
stoves
nothing
and
all
that
all
that
is
engaged
by
whom
by
messieurs
the
wagoners
how
many
are
there
of
them
twelve
there
is
enough
food
there
for
twenty
they
have
engaged
the
whole
of
it
and
paid
for
it
in
advance
the
man
seated
himself
again
and
said
without
raising
his
voice
i
am
at
an
inn
i
am
hungry
and
i
shall
remain
then
the
host
bent
down
to
his
ear
and
said
in
a
tone
which
made
him
start
go
away
at
that
moment
the
traveller
was
bending
forward
and
thrusting
some
brands
into
the
fire
with
the
iron
shod
tip
of
his
staff
he
turned
quickly
round
and
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
the
host
gazed
steadily
at
him
and
added
still
in
a
low
voice
stop
there
s
enough
of
that
sort
of
talk
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
your
name
your
name
is
jean
valjean
now
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
who
you
are
when
i
saw
you
come
in
i
suspected
something
i
sent
to
the
town
hall
and
this
was
the
reply
that
was
sent
to
me
can
you
read
so
saying
he
held
out
to
the
stranger
fully
unfolded
the
paper
which
had
just
travelled
from
the
inn
to
the
town
hall
and
from
the
town
hall
to
the
inn
the
man
cast
a
glance
upon
it
the
landlord
resumed
after
a
pause
i
am
in
the
habit
of
being
polite
to
every
one
go
away
the
man
dropped
his
head
picked
up
the
knapsack
which
he
had
deposited
on
the
ground
and
took
his
departure
he
chose
the
principal
street
he
walked
straight
on
at
a
venture
keeping
close
to
the
houses
like
a
sad
and
humiliated
man
he
did
not
turn
round
a
single
time
had
he
done
so
he
would
have
seen
the
host
of
the
cross
of
colbas
standing
on
his
threshold
surrounded
by
all
the
guests
of
his
inn
and
all
the
passers
by
in
the
street
talking
vivaciously
and
pointing
him
out
with
his
finger
and
from
the
glances
of
terror
and
distrust
cast
by
the
group
he
might
have
divined
that
his
arrival
would
speedily
become
an
event
for
the
whole
town
he
saw
nothing
of
all
this
people
who
are
crushed
do
not
look
behind
them
they
know
but
too
well
the
evil
fate
which
follows
them
thus
he
proceeded
for
some
time
walking
on
without
ceasing
traversing
at
random
streets
of
which
he
knew
nothing
forgetful
of
his
fatigue
as
is
often
the
case
when
a
man
is
sad
all
at
once
he
felt
the
pangs
of
hunger
sharply
night
was
drawing
near
he
glanced
about
him
to
see
whether
he
could
not
discover
some
shelter
the
fine
hostelry
was
closed
to
him
he
was
seeking
some
very
humble
public
house
some
hovel
however
lowly
just
then
a
light
flashed
up
at
the
end
of
the
streets
a
pine
branch
suspended
from
a
cross
beam
of
iron
was
outlined
against
the
white
sky
of
the
twilight
he
proceeded
thither
it
proved
to
be
in
fact
a
public
house
the
public
house
which
is
in
the
rue
de
chaffaut
the
wayfarer
halted
for
a
moment
and
peeped
through
the
window
into
the
interior
of
the
low
studded
room
of
the
public
house
illuminated
by
a
small
lamp
on
a
table
and
by
a
large
fire
on
the
hearth
some
men
were
engaged
in
drinking
there
the
landlord
was
warming
himself
an
iron
pot
suspended
from
a
crane
bubbled
over
the
flame
the
entrance
to
this
public
house
which
is
also
a
sort
of
an
inn
is
by
two
doors
one
opens
on
the
street
the
other
upon
a
small
yard
filled
with
manure
the
traveller
dare
not
enter
by
the
street
door
he
slipped
into
the
yard
halted
again
then
raised
the
latch
timidly
and
opened
the
door
who
goes
there
said
the
master
some
one
who
wants
supper
and
bed
good
we
furnish
supper
and
bed
here
he
entered
all
the
men
who
were
drinking
turned
round
the
lamp
illuminated
him
on
one
side
the
firelight
on
the
other
they
examined
him
for
some
time
while
he
was
taking
off
his
knapsack
the
host
said
to
him
there
is
the
fire
the
supper
is
cooking
in
the
pot
come
and
warm
yourself
comrade
he
approached
and
seated
himself
near
the
hearth
he
stretched
out
his
feet
which
were
exhausted
with
fatigue
to
the
fire
a
fine
odor
was
emitted
by
the
pot
all
that
could
be
distinguished
of
his
face
beneath
his
cap
which
was
well
pulled
down
assumed
a
vague
appearance
of
comfort
mingled
with
that
other
poignant
aspect
which
habitual
suffering
bestows
it
was
moreover
a
firm
energetic
and
melancholy
profile
this
physiognomy
was
strangely
composed
it
began
by
seeming
humble
and
ended
by
seeming
severe
the
eye
shone
beneath
its
lashes
like
a
fire
beneath
brushwood
one
of
the
men
seated
at
the
table
however
was
a
fishmonger
who
before
entering
the
public
house
of
the
rue
de
chaffaut
had
been
to
stable
his
horse
at
labarre
s
it
chanced
that
he
had
that
very
morning
encountered
this
unprepossessing
stranger
on
the
road
between
bras
d
asse
and
i
have
forgotten
the
name
i
think
it
was
escoublon
now
when
he
met
him
the
man
who
then
seemed
already
extremely
weary
had
requested
him
to
take
him
on
his
crupper
to
which
the
fishmonger
had
made
no
reply
except
by
redoubling
his
gait
this
fishmonger
had
been
a
member
half
an
hour
previously
of
the
group
which
surrounded
jacquin
labarre
and
had
himself
related
his
disagreeable
encounter
of
the
morning
to
the
people
at
the
cross
of
colbas
from
where
he
sat
he
made
an
imperceptible
sign
to
the
tavern
keeper
the
tavern
keeper
went
to
him
they
exchanged
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
the
man
had
again
become
absorbed
in
his
reflections
the
tavern
keeper
returned
to
the
fireplace
laid
his
hand
abruptly
on
the
shoulder
of
the
man
and
said
to
him
you
are
going
to
get
out
of
here
the
stranger
turned
round
and
replied
gently
ah
you
know
yes
i
was
sent
away
from
the
other
inn
and
you
are
to
be
turned
out
of
this
one
where
would
you
have
me
go
elsewhere
the
man
took
his
stick
and
his
knapsack
and
departed
as
he
went
out
some
children
who
had
followed
him
from
the
cross
of
colbas
and
who
seemed
to
be
lying
in
wait
for
him
threw
stones
at
him
he
retraced
his
steps
in
anger
and
threatened
them
with
his
stick
the
children
dispersed
like
a
flock
of
birds
he
passed
before
the
prison
at
the
door
hung
an
iron
chain
attached
to
a
bell
he
rang
the
wicket
opened
turnkey
said
he
removing
his
cap
politely
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
admit
me
and
give
me
a
lodging
for
the
night
a
voice
replied
the
prison
is
not
an
inn
get
yourself
arrested
and
you
will
be
admitted
the
wicket
closed
again
he
entered
a
little
street
in
which
there
were
many
gardens
some
of
them
are
enclosed
only
by
hedges
which
lends
a
cheerful
aspect
to
the
street
in
the
midst
of
these
gardens
and
hedges
he
caught
sight
of
a
small
house
of
a
single
story
the
window
of
which
was
lighted
up
he
peered
through
the
pane
as
he
had
done
at
the
public
house
within
was
a
large
whitewashed
room
with
a
bed
draped
in
printed
cotton
stuff
and
a
cradle
in
one
corner
a
few
wooden
chairs
and
a
double
barrelled
gun
hanging
on
the
wall
a
table
was
spread
in
the
centre
of
the
room
a
copper
lamp
illuminated
the
tablecloth
of
coarse
white
linen
the
pewter
jug
shining
like
silver
and
filled
with
wine
and
the
brown
smoking
soup
tureen
at
this
table
sat
a
man
of
about
forty
with
a
merry
and
open
countenance
who
was
dandling
a
little
child
on
his
knees
close
by
a
very
young
woman
was
nursing
another
child
the
father
was
laughing
the
child
was
laughing
the
mother
was
smiling
the
stranger
paused
a
moment
in
revery
before
this
tender
and
calming
spectacle
what
was
taking
place
within
him
he
alone
could
have
told
it
is
probable
that
he
thought
that
this
joyous
house
would
be
hospitable
and
that
in
a
place
where
he
beheld
so
much
happiness
he
would
find
perhaps
a
little
pity
he
tapped
on
the
pane
with
a
very
small
and
feeble
knock
they
did
not
hear
him
he
tapped
again
he
heard
the
woman
say
it
seems
to
me
husband
that
some
one
is
knocking
no
replied
the
husband
he
tapped
a
third
time
the
husband
rose
took
the
lamp
and
went
to
the
door
which
he
opened
he
was
a
man
of
lofty
stature
half
peasant
half
artisan
he
wore
a
huge
leather
apron
which
reached
to
his
left
shoulder
and
which
a
hammer
a
red
handkerchief
a
powder
horn
and
all
sorts
of
objects
which
were
upheld
by
the
girdle
as
in
a
pocket
caused
to
bulge
out
he
carried
his
head
thrown
backwards
his
shirt
widely
opened
and
turned
back
displayed
his
bull
neck
white
and
bare
he
had
thick
eyelashes
enormous
black
whiskers
prominent
eyes
the
lower
part
of
his
face
like
a
snout
and
besides
all
this
that
air
of
being
on
his
own
ground
which
is
indescribable
pardon
me
sir
said
the
wayfarer
could
you
in
consideration
of
payment
give
me
a
plate
of
soup
and
a
corner
of
that
shed
yonder
in
the
garden
in
which
to
sleep
tell
me
can
you
for
money
who
are
you
demanded
the
master
of
the
house
the
man
replied
i
have
just
come
from
puy
moisson
i
have
walked
all
day
long
i
have
travelled
twelve
leagues
can
you
if
i
pay
i
would
not
refuse
said
the
peasant
to
lodge
any
respectable
man
who
would
pay
me
but
why
do
you
not
go
to
the
inn
there
is
no
room
bah
impossible
this
is
neither
a
fair
nor
a
market
day
have
you
been
to
labarre
yes
well
the
traveller
replied
with
embarrassment
i
do
not
know
he
did
not
receive
me
have
you
been
to
what
s
his
name
s
in
the
rue
chaffaut
the
stranger
s
embarrassment
increased
he
stammered
he
did
not
receive
me
either
the
peasant
s
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
distrust
he
surveyed
the
newcomer
from
head
to
feet
and
suddenly
exclaimed
with
a
sort
of
shudder
are
you
the
man
he
cast
a
fresh
glance
upon
the
stranger
took
three
steps
backwards
placed
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
took
his
gun
down
from
the
wall
meanwhile
at
the
words
are
you
the
man
the
woman
had
risen
had
clasped
her
two
children
in
her
arms
and
had
taken
refuge
precipitately
behind
her
husband
staring
in
terror
at
the
stranger
with
her
bosom
uncovered
and
with
frightened
eyes
as
she
murmured
in
a
low
tone
tso
maraude
1
all
this
took
place
in
less
time
than
it
requires
to
picture
it
to
one
s
self
after
having
scrutinized
the
man
for
several
moments
as
one
scrutinizes
a
viper
the
master
of
the
house
returned
to
the
door
and
said
clear
out
for
pity
s
sake
a
glass
of
water
said
the
man
a
shot
from
my
gun
said
the
peasant
then
he
closed
the
door
violently
and
the
man
heard
him
shoot
two
large
bolts
a
moment
later
the
window
shutter
was
closed
and
the
sound
of
a
bar
of
iron
which
was
placed
against
it
was
audible
outside
night
continued
to
fall
a
cold
wind
from
the
alps
was
blowing
by
the
light
of
the
expiring
day
the
stranger
perceived
in
one
of
the
gardens
which
bordered
the
street
a
sort
of
hut
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
built
of
sods
he
climbed
over
the
wooden
fence
resolutely
and
found
himself
in
the
garden
he
approached
the
hut
its
door
consisted
of
a
very
low
and
narrow
aperture
and
it
resembled
those
buildings
which
road
laborers
construct
for
themselves
along
the
roads
he
thought
without
doubt
that
it
was
in
fact
the
dwelling
of
a
road
laborer
he
was
suffering
from
cold
and
hunger
but
this
was
at
least
a
shelter
from
the
cold
this
sort
of
dwelling
is
not
usually
occupied
at
night
he
threw
himself
flat
on
his
face
and
crawled
into
the
hut
it
was
warm
there
and
he
found
a
tolerably
good
bed
of
straw
he
lay
for
a
moment
stretched
out
on
this
bed
without
the
power
to
make
a
movement
so
fatigued
was
he
then
as
the
knapsack
on
his
back
was
in
his
way
and
as
it
furnished
moreover
a
pillow
ready
to
his
hand
he
set
about
unbuckling
one
of
the
straps
at
that
moment
a
ferocious
growl
became
audible
he
raised
his
eyes
the
head
of
an
enormous
dog
was
outlined
in
the
darkness
at
the
entrance
of
the
hut
it
was
a
dog
s
kennel
he
was
himself
vigorous
and
formidable
he
armed
himself
with
his
staff
made
a
shield
of
his
knapsack
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
kennel
in
the
best
way
he
could
not
without
enlarging
the
rents
in
his
rags
he
left
the
garden
in
the
same
manner
but
backwards
being
obliged
in
order
to
keep
the
dog
respectful
to
have
recourse
to
that
manoeuvre
with
his
stick
which
masters
in
that
sort
of
fencing
designate
as
la
rose
couverte
when
he
had
not
without
difficulty
repassed
the
fence
and
found
himself
once
more
in
the
street
alone
without
refuge
without
shelter
without
a
roof
over
his
head
chased
even
from
that
bed
of
straw
and
from
that
miserable
kennel
he
dropped
rather
than
seated
himself
on
a
stone
and
it
appears
that
a
passer
by
heard
him
exclaim
i
am
not
even
a
dog
he
soon
rose
again
and
resumed
his
march
he
went
out
of
the
town
hoping
to
find
some
tree
or
haystack
in
the
fields
which
would
afford
him
shelter
he
walked
thus
for
some
time
with
his
head
still
drooping
when
he
felt
himself
far
from
every
human
habitation
he
raised
his
eyes
and
gazed
searchingly
about
him
he
was
in
a
field
before
him
was
one
of
those
low
hills
covered
with
close
cut
stubble
which
after
the
harvest
resemble
shaved
heads
the
horizon
was
perfectly
black
this
was
not
alone
the
obscurity
of
night
it
was
caused
by
very
low
hanging
clouds
which
seemed
to
rest
upon
the
hill
itself
and
which
were
mounting
and
filling
the
whole
sky
meanwhile
as
the
moon
was
about
to
rise
and
as
there
was
still
floating
in
the
zenith
a
remnant
of
the
brightness
of
twilight
these
clouds
formed
at
the
summit
of
the
sky
a
sort
of
whitish
arch
whence
a
gleam
of
light
fell
upon
the
earth
the
earth
was
thus
better
lighted
than
the
sky
which
produces
a
particularly
sinister
effect
and
the
hill
whose
contour
was
poor
and
mean
was
outlined
vague
and
wan
against
the
gloomy
horizon
the
whole
effect
was
hideous
petty
lugubrious
and
narrow
there
was
nothing
in
the
field
or
on
the
hill
except
a
deformed
tree
which
writhed
and
shivered
a
few
paces
distant
from
the
wayfarer
this
man
was
evidently
very
far
from
having
those
delicate
habits
of
intelligence
and
spirit
which
render
one
sensible
to
the
mysterious
aspects
of
things
nevertheless
there
was
something
in
that
sky
in
that
hill
in
that
plain
in
that
tree
which
was
so
profoundly
desolate
that
after
a
moment
of
immobility
and
revery
he
turned
back
abruptly
there
are
instants
when
nature
seems
hostile
he
retraced
his
steps
the
gates
of
d
were
closed
d
which
had
sustained
sieges
during
the
wars
of
religion
was
still
surrounded
in
1815
by
ancient
walls
flanked
by
square
towers
which
have
been
demolished
since
he
passed
through
a
breach
and
entered
the
town
again
it
might
have
been
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
as
he
was
not
acquainted
with
the
streets
he
recommenced
his
walk
at
random
in
this
way
he
came
to
the
prefecture
then
to
the
seminary
as
he
passed
through
the
cathedral
square
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
church
at
the
corner
of
this
square
there
is
a
printing
establishment
it
is
there
that
the
proclamations
of
the
emperor
and
of
the
imperial
guard
to
the
army
brought
from
the
island
of
elba
and
dictated
by
napoleon
himself
were
printed
for
the
first
time
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
no
longer
entertaining
any
hope
he
lay
down
on
a
stone
bench
which
stands
at
the
doorway
of
this
printing
office
at
that
moment
an
old
woman
came
out
of
the
church
she
saw
the
man
stretched
out
in
the
shadow
what
are
you
doing
there
my
friend
said
she
he
answered
harshly
and
angrily
as
you
see
my
good
woman
i
am
sleeping
the
good
woman
who
was
well
worthy
the
name
in
fact
was
the
marquise
de
r
on
this
bench
she
went
on
i
have
had
a
mattress
of
wood
for
nineteen
years
said
the
man
to
day
i
have
a
mattress
of
stone
you
have
been
a
soldier
yes
my
good
woman
a
soldier
why
do
you
not
go
to
the
inn
because
i
have
no
money
alas
said
madame
de
r
i
have
only
four
sous
in
my
purse
give
it
to
me
all
the
same
the
man
took
the
four
sous
madame
de
r
continued
you
cannot
obtain
lodgings
in
an
inn
for
so
small
a
sum
but
have
you
tried
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
pass
the
night
thus
you
are
cold
and
hungry
no
doubt
some
one
might
have
given
you
a
lodging
out
of
charity
i
have
knocked
at
all
doors
well
i
have
been
driven
away
everywhere
the
good
woman
touched
the
man
s
arm
and
pointed
out
to
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
a
small
low
house
which
stood
beside
the
bishop
s
palace
you
have
knocked
at
all
doors
yes
have
you
knocked
at
that
one

chapter

prudence
counselled
to

that
evening
the
bishop
of
d
after
his
promenade
through
the
town
remained
shut
up
rather
late
in
his
room
he
was
busy
over
a
great
work
on
duties
which
was
never
completed
unfortunately
he
was
carefully
compiling
everything
that
the
fathers
and
the
doctors
have
said
on
this
important
subject
his
book
was
divided
into
two
parts
firstly
the
duties
of
all
secondly
the
duties
of
each
individual
according
to
the
class
to
which
he
belongs
the
duties
of
all
are
the

as
for
the
other
duties
the
bishop
found
them
pointed
out
and
prescribed
elsewhere
to
sovereigns
and
subjects
in
the
epistle
to
the
romans
to
magistrates
to
wives
to
mothers
to
young
men
by
saint
peter
to
husbands
fathers
children

in

to
the
ephesians
to
the
faithful
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
to
virgins
in
the
epistle
to
the
corinthians
out
of
these
precepts
he
was
laboriously
constructing
a
harmonious
whole
which
he
desired
to
present
to
souls
at
eight
o
clock
he
was
still
at
work
writing
with
a
good
deal
of
inconvenience
upon
little
squares
of
paper
with
a
big
book
open
on
his
knees
when
madame
magloire
entered
according
to
her
wont
to
get
the
silver
ware
from
the
cupboard
near
his
bed
a
moment
later
the
bishop
knowing
that
the
table
was
set
and
that
his
sister
was
probably
waiting
for
him
shut
his
book
rose
from
his
table
and
entered
the
dining
room
the
dining
room
was
an
oblong
apartment
with
a
fireplace
which
had
a
door
opening
on
the
street
as
we
have
said
and
a
window
opening
on
the
garden
madame
magloire
was
in
fact
just
putting
the
last
touches
to
the
table
as
she
performed
this
service
she
was
conversing
with
mademoiselle
baptistine
a
lamp
stood
on
the
table
the
table
was
near
the
fireplace
a
wood
fire
was
burning
there
one
can
easily
picture
to
one
s
self
these
two
women
both
of
whom
were
over
sixty
years
of
age
madame
magloire
small
plump
vivacious
mademoiselle
baptistine
gentle
slender
frail
somewhat
taller
than
her
brother
dressed
in
a
gown
of
puce
colored
silk
of
the
fashion
of
1806
which
she
had
purchased
at
that
date
in
paris
and
which
had
lasted
ever
since
to
borrow
vulgar
phrases
which
possess
the
merit
of
giving
utterance
in
a
single
word
to
an
idea
which
a
whole
page
would
hardly
suffice
to
express
madame
magloire
had
the
air
of
a
peasant
and
mademoiselle
baptistine
that
of
a
lady
madame
magloire
wore
a
white
quilted
cap
a
gold
jeannette
cross
on
a
velvet
ribbon
upon
her
neck
the
only
bit
of
feminine
jewelry
that
there
was
in
the
house
a
very
white
fichu
puffing
out
from
a
gown
of
coarse
black
woollen
stuff
with
large
short
sleeves
an
apron
of
cotton
cloth
in
red
and
green

knotted
round
the

with
a
stomacher
of
the

by
two
pins
at

was
cut
on
the
patterns
of
1806
with
a
short
waist
a
narrow
sheath
like
skirt
puffed
sleeves
with
flaps
and
buttons
she
concealed
her
gray
hair
under
a
frizzed
wig
known
as
the
baby
wig
madame
magloire
had
an
intelligent
vivacious
and
kindly
air
the
two
corners
of
her
mouth
unequally
raised
and
her
upper
lip
which
was
larger
than
the
lower
imparted
to
her
a
rather
crabbed
and
imperious
look
so
long
as
monseigneur
held
his
peace
she
talked
to
him
resolutely
with
a
mixture
of
respect
and
freedom
but
as
soon
as
monseigneur
began
to
speak
as
we
have
seen
she
obeyed
passively
like
her
mistress
mademoiselle
baptistine
did
not
even
speak
she
confined
herself
to
obeying
and
pleasing
him
she
had
never
been
pretty
even
when
she
was
young
she
had
large
blue
prominent
eyes
and
a
long
arched
nose
but
her
whole
visage
her
whole
person
breathed
forth
an
ineffable
goodness
as
we
stated
in
the
beginning
she
had
always
been
predestined
to
gentleness
but
faith
charity
hope
those
three
virtues
which
mildly
warm
the
soul
had
gradually
elevated
that
gentleness
to
sanctity
nature
had
made
her
a
lamb
religion
had
made
her
an
angel
poor
sainted
virgin
sweet
memory
which
has
vanished
mademoiselle
baptistine
has
so
often
narrated
what
passed
at
the
episcopal
residence
that
evening
that
there
are
many
people
now
living
who
still
recall
the
most
minute
details
at
the
moment
when
the
bishop
entered
madame
magloire
was
talking
with
considerable
vivacity
she
was
haranguing
mademoiselle
baptistine
on
a
subject
which
was
familiar
to
her
and
to
which
the
bishop
was
also
accustomed
the
question
concerned
the
lock
upon
the
entrance
door
it
appears
that
while
procuring
some
provisions
for
supper
madame
magloire
had
heard
things
in
divers
places
people
had
spoken
of
a
prowler
of
evil
appearance
a
suspicious
vagabond
had
arrived
who
must
be
somewhere
about
the
town
and
those
who
should
take
it
into
their
heads
to
return
home
late
that
night
might
be
subjected
to
unpleasant
encounters
the
police
was
very
badly
organized
moreover
because
there
was
no
love
lost
between
the
prefect
and
the
mayor
who
sought
to
injure
each
other
by
making
things
happen
it
behooved
wise
people
to
play
the
part
of
their
own
police
and
to
guard
themselves
well
and
care
must
be
taken
to
duly
close
bar
and
barricade
their
houses
and
to
fasten
the
doors
well
madame
magloire
emphasized
these
last
words
but
the
bishop
had
just
come
from
his
room
where
it
was
rather
cold
he
seated
himself
in
front
of
the
fire
and
warmed
himself
and
then
fell
to
thinking
of
other
things
he
did
not
take
up
the
remark
dropped
with
design
by
madame
magloire
she
repeated
it
then
mademoiselle
baptistine
desirous
of
satisfying
madame
magloire
without
displeasing
her
brother
ventured
to
say
timidly
did
you
hear
what
madame
magloire
is
saying
brother
i
have
heard
something
of
it
in
a
vague
way
replied
the
bishop
then
half
turning
in
his
chair
placing
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
raising
towards
the
old
servant
woman
his
cordial
face
which
so
easily
grew
joyous
and
which
was
illuminated
from
below
by
the
firelight
come
what
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
are
we
in
any
great
danger
then
madame
magloire
began
the
whole
story
afresh
exaggerating
it
a
little
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
it
appeared
that
a
bohemian
a
bare
footed
vagabond
a
sort
of
dangerous
mendicant
was
at
that
moment
in
the
town
he
had
presented
himself
at
jacquin
labarre
s
to
obtain
lodgings
but
the
latter
had
not
been
willing
to
take
him
in
he
had
been
seen
to
arrive
by
the
way
of
the
boulevard
gassendi
and
roam
about
the
streets
in
the
gloaming
a
gallows
bird
with
a
terrible
face
really
said
the
bishop
this
willingness
to
interrogate
encouraged
madame
magloire
it
seemed
to
her
to
indicate
that
the
bishop
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
alarmed
she
pursued
triumphantly
yes
monseigneur
that
is
how
it
is
there
will
be
some
sort
of
catastrophe
in
this
town
to
night
every
one
says
so
and
withal
the
police
is
so
badly
regulated
a
useful
repetition
the
idea
of
living
in
a
mountainous
country
and
not
even
having
lights
in
the
streets
at
night
one
goes
out
black
as
ovens
indeed
and
i
say
monseigneur
and
mademoiselle
there
says
with
me
i
interrupted
his
sister
say
nothing
what
my
brother
does
is
well
done
madame
magloire
continued
as
though
there
had
been
no
protest
we
say
that
this
house
is
not
safe
at
all
that
if
monseigneur
will
permit
i
will
go
and
tell
paulin
musebois
the
locksmith
to
come
and
replace
the
ancient
locks
on
the
doors
we
have
them
and
it
is
only
the
work
of
a
moment
for
i
say
that
nothing
is
more
terrible
than
a
door
which
can
be
opened
from
the
outside
with
a
latch
by
the
first
passer
by
and
i
say
that
we
need
bolts
monseigneur
if
only
for
this
night
moreover
monseigneur
has
the
habit
of
always
saying
come
in
and
besides
even
in
the
middle
of
the
night
o
mon
dieu
there
is
no
need
to
ask
permission
at
that
moment
there
came
a
tolerably
violent
knock
on
the
door
come
in
said
the
bishop
chapter
iii
the
heroism
of
passive
obedience
the
door
opened
it
opened
wide
with
a
rapid
movement
as
though
some
one
had
given
it
an
energetic
and
resolute
push
a
man
entered
we
already
know
the
man
it
was
the
wayfarer
whom
we
have
seen
wandering
about
in
search
of
shelter
he
entered
advanced
a
step
and
halted
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
he
had
his
knapsack
on
his
shoulders
his
cudgel
in
his
hand
a
rough
audacious
weary
and
violent
expression
in
his
eyes
the
fire
on
the
hearth
lighted
him
up
he
was
hideous
it
was
a
sinister
apparition
madame
magloire
had
not
even
the
strength
to
utter
a
cry
she
trembled
and
stood
with
her
mouth
wide
open
mademoiselle
baptistine
turned
round
beheld
the
man
entering
and
half
started
up
in
terror
then
turning
her
head
by
degrees
towards
the
fireplace
again
she
began
to
observe
her
brother
and
her
face
became
once
more
profoundly
calm
and
serene
the
bishop
fixed
a
tranquil
eye
on
the
man
as
he
opened
his
mouth
doubtless
to
ask
the
new
comer
what
he
desired
the
man
rested
both
hands
on
his
staff
directed
his
gaze
at
the
old
man
and
the
two
women
and
without
waiting
for
the
bishop
to
speak
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
see
here
my
name
is
jean
valjean
i
am
a
convict
from
the
galleys
i
have
passed

this
evening
when

parts

inn
and
they
turned

out
because

my
yellow
passport

the

not

i
went
into
a
dog
s
kennel
the
dog
bit
me
and
chased
me
off
as
though
he
had
been
a
man
one
would
have
said
that
he
knew
who
i
was
i
went
into
the
fields
intending
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
beneath
the
stars
there
were
no
stars
i
thought
it
was
going
to
rain
and
i
re
entered
the
town
to
seek
the
recess
of
a
doorway
yonder
in
the
square
i
meant
to
sleep
on
a
stone
bench
a
good
woman
pointed
out
your
house
to
me
and
said

that

madame
magloire
said
the
bishop

will
set
another
place
the
man
advanced
three
paces
and
approached
the
lamp
which
was
on
the
table
stop
he
resumed
as
though
he
had
not
quite
understood
that
s
not
it
did
you
hear
i
am
a
galley
slave
a
convict
i
come
from
the
galleys
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
large
sheet
of
yellow
paper
which
he
unfolded
here
s
my
passport
yellow
as
you
see
this
serves
to
expel
me
from
every
place
where
i
go
will
you

it
i
know
how
to
read
i
learned
in
the
galleys
there

a
school
there
for
those
who
choose
to
learn
hold
this
is
what
they
put
on
this
passport
jean
valjean
discharged
convict
native
of
that
is
nothing
to
you
has
been
nineteen
years
in
the
galleys
five
years
for
house
breaking
and
burglary
fourteen
years
for

attempted
to

four
occasions
he
is
a
very
dangerous
man

one
has
cast
me
out

to
receive

this
an
inn

something
to

and
a
bed

stable
madame
magloire
said
the
bishop
you
will
put
white
sheets
on
the
bed
in
the
alcove
we
have
already
explained
the
character
of
the
two
women
s
obedience
madame
magloire
retired
to
execute
these
orders
the
bishop
turned
to
the
man
sit
down
sir
and
warm
yourself
we
are
going
to
sup
in
a
few
moments
and
your
bed
will
be
prepared
while
you
are
supping
at
this
point
the
man
suddenly
comprehended
the
expression
of
his
face
up
to
that
time
sombre
and
harsh
bore
the
imprint
of
stupefaction
of
doubt
of
joy
and
became
extraordinary
he
began
stammering
like
a
crazy
man
really
what
you
will
keep
me
you
do
not
drive
me
forth
a
convict
you
call
me

you
do
not
address
me
as
thou
get
out
of
here
you

what
people
always
say
to
me
i
felt
sure
that
you
would
expel
me
so
i
told
you
at
once
who
i
am
oh
what
a
good
woman
that
was
who
directed
me
hither
i
am
going
to
sup
a
bed
with
a
mattress
and
sheets
like
the
rest
of
the
world
a
bed
it
is
nineteen
years
since
i
have
slept
in
a
bed

do
not

monsieur
the

a
fine
man

an
inn
keeper

replied
the
bishop
a
priest
who
lives
here
a
priest
said
the
man
oh
what
a
fine
priest
then
you
are
not
going
to
demand
any
money
of
me
you
are
the
cure
are
you
not
the
cure
of
this
big
church
well
i
am
a
fool
truly
i
had
not
perceived
your
skull
cap
as
he
spoke
he
deposited
his
knapsack
and
his
cudgel
in
a
corner
replaced
his
passport
in
his
pocket
and
seated
himself
mademoiselle
baptistine
gazed
mildly
at
him
he
continued
you
are
humane
monsieur
le
cure
you
have
not
scorned
me
a
good
priest
is
a
very
good
thing
then
you
do
not
require
me
to
pay
no
said
the
bishop
keep
your
money
how
much
have
you
did
you
not
tell
me
one
hundred
and
nine
francs
and
fifteen
sous
added
the
man
one
hundred
and
nine
francs
fifteen
sous
and
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
earn
that
nineteen
years
nineteen
years
the
bishop
sighed
deeply
the
man
continued
i
have
still
the
whole
of
my
money
in
four
days
i
have
spent
only
twenty
five
sous
which
i
earned
by
helping
unload
some
wagons
at
grasse
since
you
are
an
abbe
i
will
tell
you
that
we
had
a
chaplain
in
the
galleys
and
one
day
i
saw
a
bishop
there
monseigneur
is
what
they
call
him
he
was
the
bishop
of
majore
at
marseilles
he
is
the
cure
who
rules
over
the
other
cures
you
understand
pardon
me
i
say
that
very
badly
but
it
is
such
a
far
off
thing
to
me
you
understand
what
we
are
he
said
mass
in
the
middle
of
the
galleys
on
an
altar
he
had
a
pointed
thing
made
of
gold
on
his
head
it
glittered
in
the
bright
light
of
midday
we
were
all
ranged
in
lines
on
the
three
sides
with
cannons
with
lighted
matches
facing
us
we
could
not
see
very
well
he
spoke
but
he
was
too
far
off
and
we
did
not
hear
that
is
what
a
bishop
is
like
while
he
was
speaking
the
bishop
had
gone
and
shut
the
door
which
had
remained
wide
open
madame
magloire
returned
she
brought
a
silver
fork
and
spoon
which
she
placed
on
the
table
madame
magloire
said
the
bishop
place
those
things
as
near
the
fire
as
possible
and
turning
to
his
guest
the
night
wind
is
harsh
on
the
alps
you
must
be
cold
sir
each
time
that
he
uttered
the
word
sir
in
his
voice
which
was
so
gently
grave
and
polished
the
man
s
face
lighted
up
monsieur
to
a
convict
is
like
a
glass
of
water
to
one
of
the
shipwrecked
of
the
medusa
ignominy
thirsts
for
consideration
this
lamp
gives
a
very
bad
light
said
the
bishop
madame
magloire
understood
him
and
went
to
get
the
two
silver
candlesticks
from
the
chimney
piece
in
monseigneur
s
bed
chamber
and
placed
them
lighted
on
the
table
monsieur
le
cure
said
the
man
you
are
good
you
do
not
despise
me
you
receive
me
into
your
house
you
light
your
candles
for
me
yet
i
have
not
concealed
from
you
whence
i
come
and
that
i
am
an
unfortunate
man
the
bishop
who
was
sitting
close
to
him
gently
touched
his
hand
you
could
not
help
telling
me
who
you
were
this
is
not
my
house
it
is
the
house
of
jesus
christ
this
door
does
not
demand
of
him
who
enters
whether
he
has
a
name
but
whether
he
has
a
grief
you
suffer
you
are
hungry
and
thirsty
you
are
welcome
and
do
not
thank
me
do
not
say
that
i
receive
you
in
my
house
no
one
is
at
home
here
except
the
man
who
needs
a
refuge
i
say
to
you
who
are
passing
by
that
you
are
much
more
at
home
here
than
i
am
myself
everything
here
is
yours
what
need
have
i
to
know
your
name
besides
before
you
told
me
you
had
one
which
i
knew
the
man
opened
his
eyes
in
astonishment
really
you
knew
what
i
was
called
yes
replied
the
bishop
you
are
called
my
brother
stop
monsieur
le
cure
exclaimed
the
man
i
was
very
hungry
when
i
entered
here
but
you
are
so
good
that
i
no
longer
know
what
has
happened
to
me
the
bishop
looked
at
him
and
said
you
have
suffered
much
oh
the
red
coat
the
ball
on
the
ankle
a
plank
to
sleep
on
heat
cold
toil
the
convicts
the
thrashings
the
double
chain
for
nothing
the
cell
for
one
word
even
sick
and
in
bed
still
the
chain
dogs
dogs
are
happier
nineteen
years
i
am
forty
six
now
there
is
the
yellow
passport
that
is
what
it
is
like
yes
resumed
the
bishop
you
have
come
from
a
very
sad
place
listen
there
will
be
more
joy
in
heaven
over
the
tear
bathed
face
of
a
repentant
sinner
than
over
the
white
robes
of
a
hundred
just
men
if
you
emerge
from
that
sad
place
with
thoughts
of
hatred
and
of
wrath
against
mankind
you
are
deserving
of
pity
if
you
emerge
with
thoughts
of
good
will
and
of
peace
you
are
more
worthy
than
any
one
of
us
in
the
meantime
madame
magloire
had
served
supper
soup
made
with
water
oil
bread
and
salt
a
little
bacon
a
bit
of
mutton
figs
a
fresh
cheese
and
a
large
loaf
of
rye
bread
she
had
of
her
own
accord
added
to
the
bishop
s
ordinary
fare
a
bottle
of
his
old
mauves
wine
the
bishop
s
face
at
once
assumed
that
expression
of
gayety
which
is
peculiar
to
hospitable
natures
to
table
he
cried
vivaciously
as
was
his
custom
when
a
stranger
supped
with
him
he
made
the
man
sit
on
his
right
mademoiselle
baptistine
perfectly
peaceable
and
natural
took
her
seat
at
his
left
the
bishop
asked
a
blessing
then
helped
the
soup
himself
according
to
his
custom
the
man
began
to
eat
with
avidity
all
at
once
the
bishop
said
it
strikes
me
there
is
something
missing
on
this
table
madame
magloire
had
in
fact
only
placed
the
three
sets
of
forks
and
spoons
which
were
absolutely
necessary
now
it
was
the
usage
of
the
house
when
the
bishop
had
any
one
to
supper
to
lay
out
the
whole
six
sets
of
silver
on
the
table
cloth
an
innocent
ostentation
this
graceful
semblance
of
luxury
was
a
kind
of
child
s
play
which
was
full
of
charm
in
that
gentle
and
severe
household
which
raised
poverty
into
dignity
madame
magloire
understood
the
remark
went
out
without
saying
a
word
and
a
moment
later
the
three
sets
of
silver
forks
and
spoons
demanded
by
the
bishop
were
glittering
upon
the
cloth
symmetrically
arranged
before
the
three
persons
seated
at
the
table
chapter
iv
details
concerning
the
cheese
dairies
of
pontarlier
now
in
order
to
convey
an
idea
of
what
passed
at
that
table
we
cannot
do
better
than
to
transcribe
here
a
passage
from
one
of
mademoiselle
baptistine
s
letters
to
madame
boischevron
wherein
the
conversation
between
the
convict
and
the
bishop
is
described
with
ingenious
minuteness
this
man
paid
no
attention
to
any
one
he
ate
with
the
voracity
of
a
starving
man
however
after
supper
he
said
monsieur
le
cure
of
the
good
god
all
this
is
far
too
good
for
me
but
i
must
say
that
the
carters
who
would
not
allow
me
to
eat
with
them
keep
a
better
table
than
you
do
between
ourselves
the
remark
rather
shocked
me
my
brother
replied
they
are
more
fatigued
than
i
no
returned
the
man
they
have
more
money
you
are
poor
i
see
that
plainly
you
cannot
be
even
a
curate
are
you
really
a
cure
ah
if
the
good
god
were
but
just
you
certainly
ought
to
be
a
cure
the
good
god
is
more
than
just
said
my
brother
a
moment
later
he
added
monsieur
jean
valjean
is
it
to
pontarlier
that
you
are
going
with
my
road
marked
out
for
me
i
think
that
is
what
the
man
said
then
he
went
on
i
must
be
on
my
way
by
daybreak
to
morrow
travelling
is
hard
if
the
nights
are
cold
the
days
are
hot
you
are
going
to
a
good
country
said
my
brother
during
the
revolution
my
family
was
ruined
i
took
refuge
in
franche
comte
at
first
and
there
i
lived
for
some
time
by
the
toil
of
my
hands
my
will
was
good
i
found
plenty
to
occupy
me
one
has
only
to
choose
there
are
paper
mills
tanneries
distilleries
oil
factories
watch
factories
on
a
large
scale
steel
mills
copper
works
twenty
iron
foundries
at
least
four
of
which
situated
at
lods
at
chatillon
at
audincourt
and
at
beure
are
tolerably
large
i
think
i
am
not
mistaken
in
saying
that
those
are
the
names
which
my
brother
mentioned
then
he
interrupted
himself
and
addressed
me
have
we
not
some
relatives
in
those
parts
my
dear
sister
i
replied
we
did
have
some
among
others
m
de
lucenet
who
was
captain
of
the
gates
at
pontarlier
under
the
old
regime
yes
resumed
my
brother
but
in
93
one
had
no
longer
any
relatives
one
had
only
one
s
arms
i
worked
they
have
in
the
country
of
pontarlier
whither
you
are
going
monsieur
valjean
a
truly
patriarchal
and
truly
charming
industry
my
sister
it
is
their
cheese
dairies
which
they
call
fruitieres
then
my
brother
while
urging
the
man
to
eat
explained
to
him
with
great
minuteness
what
these
fruitieres
of
pontarlier
were
that
they
were
divided
into
two
classes
the
big
barns
which
belong
to
the
rich
and
where
there
are
forty
or
fifty
cows
which
produce
from
seven
to
eight
thousand
cheeses
each
summer
and
the
associated
fruitieres
which
belong
to
the
poor
these
are
the
peasants
of
mid
mountain
who
hold
their
cows
in
common
and
share
the
proceeds
they
engage
the
services
of
a
cheese
maker
whom
they
call
the
grurin
the
grurin
receives
the
milk
of
the
associates
three
times
a
day
and
marks
the
quantity
on
a
double
tally
it
is
towards
the
end
of
april
that
the
work
of
the
cheese
dairies
begins
it
is
towards
the
middle
of
june
that
the
cheese
makers
drive
their
cows
to
the
mountains
the
man
recovered
his
animation
as
he
ate
my
brother
made
him
drink
that
good
mauves
wine
which
he
does
not
drink
himself
because
he
says
that
wine
is
expensive
my
brother
imparted
all
these
details
with
that
easy
gayety
of
his
with
which
you
are
acquainted
interspersing
his
words
with
graceful
attentions
to
me
he
recurred
frequently
to
that
comfortable
trade
of
grurin
as
though
he
wished
the
man
to
understand
without
advising
him
directly
and
harshly
that
this
would
afford
him
a
refuge
one
thing
struck
me
this
man
was
what
i
have
told
you
well
neither
during
supper
nor
during
the
entire
evening
did
my
brother
utter
a
single
word
with
the
exception
of
a
few
words
about
jesus
when
he
entered
which
could
remind
the
man
of
what
he
was
nor
of
what
my
brother
was
to
all
appearances
it
was
an
occasion
for
preaching
him
a
little
sermon
and
of
impressing
the
bishop
on
the
convict
so
that
a
mark
of
the
passage
might
remain
behind
this
might
have
appeared
to
any
one
else
who
had
this
unfortunate
man
in
his
hands
to
afford
a
chance
to
nourish
his
soul
as
well
as
his
body
and
to
bestow
upon
him
some
reproach
seasoned
with
moralizing
and
advice
or
a
little
commiseration
with
an
exhortation
to
conduct
himself
better
in
the
future
my
brother
did
not
even
ask
him
from
what
country
he
came
nor
what
was
his
history
for
in
his
history
there
is
a
fault
and
my
brother
seemed
to
avoid
everything
which
could
remind
him
of
it
to
such
a
point
did
he
carry
it
that
at
one
time
when
my
brother
was
speaking
of
the
mountaineers
of
pontarlier
who
exercise
a
gentle
labor
near
heaven
and
who
he
added
are
happy
because
they
are
innocent
he
stopped
short
fearing
lest
in
this
remark
there
might
have
escaped
him
something
which
might
wound
the
man
by
dint
of
reflection
i
think
i
have
comprehended
what
was
passing
in
my
brother
s
heart
he
was
thinking
no
doubt
that
this
man
whose
name
is
jean
valjean
had
his
misfortune
only
too
vividly
present
in
his
mind
that
the
best
thing
was
to
divert
him
from
it
and
to
make
him
believe
if
only
momentarily
that
he
was
a
person
like
any
other
by
treating
him
just
in
his
ordinary
way
is
not
this
indeed
to
understand
charity
well
is
there
not
dear
madame
something
truly
evangelical
in
this
delicacy
which
abstains
from
sermon
from
moralizing
from
allusions
and
is
not
the
truest
pity
when
a
man
has
a
sore
point
not
to
touch
it
at
all
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
this
might
have
been
my
brother
s
private
thought
in
any
case
what
i
can
say
is
that
if
he
entertained
all
these
ideas
he
gave
no
sign
of
them
from
beginning
to
end
even
to
me
he
was
the
same
as
he
is
every
evening
and
he
supped
with
this
jean
valjean
with
the
same
air
and
in
the
same
manner
in
which
he
would
have
supped
with
m
gedeon
le
provost
or
with
the
curate
of
the
parish
towards
the
end
when
he
had
reached
the
figs
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
mother
gerbaud
with
her
little
one
in
her
arms
my
brother
kissed
the
child
on
the
brow
and
borrowed
fifteen
sous
which
i
had
about
me
to
give
to
mother
gerbaud
the
man
was
not
paying
much
heed
to
anything
then
he
was
no
longer
talking
and
he
seemed
very
much
fatigued
after
poor
old
gerbaud
had
taken
her
departure
my
brother
said
grace
then
he
turned
to
the
man
and
said
to
him
you
must
be
in
great
need
of
your
bed
madame
magloire
cleared
the
table
very
promptly
i
understood
that
we
must
retire
in
order
to
allow
this
traveller
to
go
to
sleep
and
we
both
went
up
stairs
nevertheless
i
sent
madame
magloire
down
a
moment
later
to
carry
to
the
man
s
bed
a
goat
skin
from
the
black
forest
which
was
in
my
room
the
nights
are
frigid
and
that
keeps
one
warm
it
is
a
pity
that
this
skin
is
old
all
the
hair
is
falling
out
my
brother
bought
it
while
he
was
in
germany
at
tottlingen
near
the
sources
of
the
danube
as
well
as
the
little
ivory
handled
knife
which
i
use
at
table
madame
magloire
returned
immediately
we
said
our
prayers
in
the
drawing
room
where
we
hang
up
the
linen
and
then
we
each
retired
to
our
own
chambers
without
saying
a
word
to
each
other
chapter
v
tranquillity
after
bidding
his
sister
good
night
monseigneur
bienvenu
took
one
of
the
two
silver
candlesticks
from
the
table
handed
the
other
to
his
guest
and
said
to
him
monsieur
i
will
conduct
you
to
your
room
the
man
followed
him
as
might
have
been
observed
from
what
has
been
said
above
the
house
was
so
arranged
that
in
order
to
pass
into
the
oratory
where
the
alcove
was
situated
or
to
get
out
of
it
it
was
necessary
to
traverse
the
bishop
s
bedroom
at
the
moment
when
he
was
crossing
this
apartment
madame
magloire
was
putting
away
the
silverware
in
the
cupboard
near
the
head
of
the
bed
this
was
her
last
care
every
evening
before
she
went
to
bed
the
bishop
installed
his
guest
in
the
alcove
a
fresh
white
bed
had
been
prepared
there
the
man
set
the
candle
down
on
a
small
table
well
said
the
bishop
may
you
pass
a
good
night
to
morrow
morning
before
you
set
out
you
shall
drink
a
cup
of
warm
milk
from
our
cows
thanks
monsieur
l
abbe
said
the
man
hardly
had
he
pronounced
these
words
full
of
peace
when
all
of
a
sudden
and
without
transition
he
made
a
strange
movement
which
would
have
frozen
the
two
sainted
women
with
horror
had
they
witnessed
it
even
at
this
day
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
explain
what
inspired
him
at
that
moment
did
he
intend
to
convey
a
warning
or
to
throw
out
a
menace
was
he
simply
obeying
a
sort
of
instinctive
impulse
which
was
obscure
even
to
himself
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
old
man
folded
his
arms
and
bending
upon
his
host
a
savage
gaze
he
exclaimed
in
a
hoarse
voice
ah
really
you
lodge
me
in
your
house
close
to
yourself
like
this
he
broke
off
and
added
with
a
laugh
in
which
there
lurked
something
monstrous
have
you
really
reflected
well
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
not
been
an
assassin
the
bishop
replied
that
is
the
concern
of
the
good
god
then
gravely
and
moving
his
lips
like
one
who
is
praying
or
talking
to
himself
he
raised
two
fingers
of
his
right
hand
and
bestowed
his
benediction
on
the
man
who
did
not
bow
and
without
turning
his
head
or
looking
behind
him
he
returned
to
his
bedroom
when
the
alcove
was
in
use
a
large
serge
curtain
drawn
from
wall
to
wall
concealed
the
altar
the
bishop
knelt
before
this
curtain
as
he
passed
and
said
a
brief
prayer
a
moment
later
he
was
in
his
garden
walking
meditating
contemplating
his
heart
and
soul
wholly
absorbed
in
those
grand
and
mysterious
things
which
god
shows
at
night
to
the
eyes
which
remain
open
as
for
the
man
he
was
actually
so
fatigued
that
he
did
not
even
profit
by
the
nice
white
sheets
snuffing
out
his
candle
with
his
nostrils
after
the
manner
of
convicts
he
dropped
all
dressed
as
he
was
upon
the
bed
where
he
immediately
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
midnight
struck
as
the
bishop
returned
from
his
garden
to
his
apartment
a
few
minutes
later
all
were
asleep
in
the
little
house
chapter
vi
jean
valjean
towards
the
middle
of
the
night
jean
valjean
woke
jean
valjean
came
from
a
poor
peasant
family
of
brie
he
had
not
learned
to
read
in
his
childhood
when
he
reached
man
s
estate
he
became
a
tree
pruner
at
faverolles
his
mother
was
named
jeanne
mathieu
his
father
was
called
jean
valjean
or
vlajean
probably
a
sobriquet
and
a
contraction
of
viola
jean
here
s
jean
jean
valjean
was
of
that
thoughtful
but
not
gloomy
disposition
which
constitutes
the
peculiarity
of
affectionate
natures
on
the
whole
however
there
was
something
decidedly
sluggish
and
insignificant
about
jean
valjean
in
appearance
at
least
he
had
lost
his
father
and
mother
at
a
very
early
age
his
mother
had
died
of
a
milk
fever
which
had
not
been
properly
attended
to
his
father
a
tree
pruner
like
himself
had
been
killed
by
a
fall
from
a
tree
all
that
remained
to
jean
valjean
was
a
sister
older
than
himself
a
widow
with
seven
children
boys
and
girls
this
sister
had
brought
up
jean
valjean
and
so
long
as
she
had
a
husband
she
lodged
and
fed
her
young
brother
the
husband
died
the
eldest
of
the
seven
children
was
eight
years
old
the
youngest
one
jean
valjean
had
just
attained
his
twenty
fifth
year
he
took
the
father
s
place
and
in
his
turn
supported
the
sister
who
had
brought
him
up
this
was
done
simply
as
a
duty
and
even
a
little
churlishly
on
the
part
of
jean
valjean
thus
his
youth
had
been
spent
in
rude
and
ill
paid
toil
he
had
never
known
a
kind
woman
friend
in
his
native
parts
he
had
not
had
the
time
to
fall
in
love
he
returned
at
night
weary
and
ate
his
broth
without
uttering
a
word
his
sister
mother
jeanne
often
took
the
best
part
of
his
repast
from
his
bowl
while
he
was
eating
a
bit
of
meat
a
slice
of
bacon
the
heart
of
the
cabbage
to
give
to
one
of
her
children
as
he
went
on
eating
with
his
head
bent
over
the
table
and
almost
into
his
soup
his
long
hair
falling
about
his
bowl
and
concealing
his
eyes
he
had
the
air
of
perceiving
nothing
and
allowing
it
there
was
at
faverolles
not
far
from
the
valjean
thatched
cottage
on
the
other
side
of
the
lane
a
farmer
s
wife
named
marie
claude
the
valjean
children
habitually
famished
sometimes
went
to
borrow
from
marie
claude
a
pint
of
milk
in
their
mother
s
name
which
they
drank
behind
a
hedge
or
in
some
alley
corner
snatching
the
jug
from
each
other
so
hastily
that
the
little
girls
spilled
it
on
their
aprons
and
down
their
necks
if
their
mother
had
known
of
this
marauding
she
would
have
punished
the
delinquents
severely
jean
valjean
gruffly
and
grumblingly
paid
marie
claude
for
the
pint
of
milk
behind
their
mother

he
earned
eighteen
sous
a
day
then
he
hired
out
as
a
hay
maker
as
laborer
as
neat

on

farm
as
a
drudge
he
did
whatever
he
could
his
sister
worked
also
but
what
could
she
do
with
seven
little
children
it
was
a
sad
group
enveloped
in
misery
which
was
being
gradually
annihilated
a
very
hard
winter
came
jean
had
no
work
the
family
had
no
bread
no
bread
literally
seven
children
one
sunday
evening
maubert
isabeau
the
baker
on
the
church
square
at
faverolles
was
preparing
to
go
to
bed
when
he
heard
a
violent
blow
on
the
grated
front
of
his
shop
he
arrived
in
time
to
see
an
arm
passed
through
a
hole
made
by
a
blow
from
a
fist
through
the
grating
and
the
glass
the
arm
seized
a
loaf
of
bread
and
carried
it
off
isabeau
ran
out
in
haste
the
robber
fled
at
the
full
speed
of
his
legs
isabeau
ran
after
him
and
stopped
him
the
thief
had
flung
away
the
loaf
but
his
arm
was
still
bleeding
it
was
jean
valjean
this
took
place
in
1795
jean
valjean
was
taken
before
the
tribunals
of
the
time
for
theft
and
breaking
and
entering
an
inhabited
house
at
night
he
had
a
gun
which
he
used
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
he
was
a
bit
of
a
poacher
and
this
injured
his
case
there
exists
a
legitimate
prejudice
against
poachers
the
poacher
like
the
smuggler
smacks
too
strongly
of
the
brigand
nevertheless
we
will
remark
cursorily
there
is
still
an
abyss
between
these
races
of
men
and
the
hideous
assassin
of
the
towns
the
poacher
lives
in
the
forest
the
smuggler
lives
in
the
mountains
or
on
the
sea
the
cities
make
ferocious
men
because
they
make
corrupt
men
the
mountain
the
sea
the
forest
make
savage
men
they
develop
the
fierce
side
but
often
without
destroying
the
humane
side
jean
valjean
was
pronounced
guilty
the
terms
of
the
code
were
explicit
there
occur
formidable
hours
in
our
civilization
there
are
moments
when
the
penal
laws
decree
a
shipwreck
what
an
ominous
minute
is
that
in
which
society
draws
back
and
consummates
the
irreparable
abandonment
of
a
sentient
being
jean
valjean
was
condemned
to
five
years
in
the
galleys
on
the
22d
of
april
1796
the
victory
of
montenotte
won
by
the
general
in
chief
of
the
army
of
italy
whom
the
message
of
the
directory
to
the
five
hundred
of
the
2d
of
floreal
year
iv
calls
buona
parte
was
announced
in
paris
on
that
same
day
a
great
gang
of
galley
slaves
was
put
in
chains
at
bicetre
jean
valjean
formed
a
part
of
that
gang
an
old
turnkey
of
the
prison
who
is
now
nearly
eighty
years
old
still
recalls
perfectly
that
unfortunate
wretch
who
was
chained
to
the
end
of
the
fourth
line
in
the
north
angle
of
the
courtyard
he
was
seated
on
the
ground
like
the
others
he
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
his
position
except
that
it
was
horrible
it
is
probable
that
he
also
was
disentangling
from
amid
the
vague
ideas
of
a
poor
man
ignorant
of
everything
something
excessive
while
the
bolt
of
his
iron
collar
was
being
riveted
behind
his
head
with
heavy
blows
from
the
hammer
he
wept
his
tears
stifled
him
they
impeded
his
speech
he
only
managed
to
say
from
time
to
time
i
was
a
tree
pruner
at
faverolles
then
still
sobbing
he
raised
his
right
hand
and
lowered
it
gradually
seven
times
as
though
he
were
touching
in
succession
seven
heads
of
unequal
heights
and
from
this
gesture
it
was
divined
that
the
thing
which
he
had
done
whatever
it
was
he
had
done
for
the
sake
of
clothing
and
nourishing
seven
little
children
he
set
out
for
toulon
he
arrived
there
after
a
journey
of
twenty
seven
days
on
a
cart
with
a
chain
on
his
neck
at
toulon
he
was
clothed
in
the
red
cassock
all
that
had
constituted
his
life
even
to
his
name
was
effaced
he
was
no
longer
even
jean
valjean
he
was

what
became
of
his
sister
what
became
of
the
seven
children
who
troubled
himself
about
that
what
becomes
of
the
handful
of
leaves
from
the
young
tree
which
is
sawed
off
at
the
root
it
is
always
the
same
story
these
poor
living
beings
these
creatures
of
god
henceforth
without
support
without
guide
without
refuge
wandered
away
at
random
who
even
knows
each
in
his
own
direction
perhaps
and
little
by
little
buried
themselves
in
that
cold
mist
which
engulfs
solitary
destinies
gloomy
shades
into
which
disappear
in
succession
so
many
unlucky
heads
in
the
sombre
march
of
the
human
race
they
quitted
the
country
the
clock
tower
of
what
had
been
their
village
forgot
them
the
boundary
line
of
what
had
been
their
field
forgot
them
after
a
few
years
residence
in
the
galleys
jean
valjean
himself
forgot
them
in
that
heart
where
there
had
been
a
wound
there
was
a
scar
that
is
all
only
once
during
all
the
time
which
he
spent
at
toulon
did
he
hear
his
sister
mentioned
this
happened
i
think
towards
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
of
his
captivity
i
know
not
through
what
channels
the
news
reached
him
some
one
who
had
known
them
in
their
own
country
had
seen
his
sister
she
was
in
paris
she
lived
in
a
poor
street
rear
saint
sulpice
in
the
rue
du
gindre
she
had
with
her
only
one
child
a
little
boy
the
youngest
where
were
the
other
six
perhaps
she
did
not
know
herself
every
morning
she
went
to
a
printing
office
no
3
rue
du
sabot
where
she
was
a
folder
and
stitcher
she
was
obliged
to
be
there
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
long
before
daylight
in
winter
in
the
same
building
with
the
printing
office
there
was
a
school
and
to
this
school
she
took
her
little
boy
who
was
seven
years
old
but
as
she
entered
the
printing
office
at
six
and
the
school
only
opened
at
seven
the
child
had
to
wait
in
the
courtyard
for
the
school
to
open
for
an
hour
one
hour
of
a
winter
night
in
the
open
air
they
would
not
allow
the
child
to
come
into
the
printing
office
because
he
was
in
the
way
they
said
when
the
workmen
passed
in
the
morning
they
beheld
this
poor
little
being
seated
on
the
pavement
overcome
with
drowsiness
and
often
fast
asleep
in
the
shadow
crouched
down
and
doubled
up
over
his
basket
when
it
rained
an
old
woman
the
portress
took
pity
on
him
she
took
him
into
her
den
where
there
was
a
pallet
a
spinning
wheel
and
two
wooden
chairs
and
the
little
one
slumbered
in
a
corner
pressing
himself
close
to
the
cat
that
he
might
suffer
less
from
cold
at
seven
o
clock
the
school
opened
and
he
entered
that
is
what
was
told
to
jean
valjean
they
talked
to
him
about
it
for
one
day
it
was
a
moment
a
flash
as
though
a
window
had
suddenly
been
opened
upon
the
destiny
of
those
things
whom
he
had
loved
then
all
closed
again
he
heard
nothing
more
forever
nothing
from
them
ever
reached
him
again
he
never
beheld
them
he
never
met
them
again
and
in
the
continuation
of
this
mournful
history
they
will
not
be
met
with
any
more
towards
the
end
of
this
fourth
year
jean
valjean
s
turn
to
escape
arrived
his
comrades
assisted
him
as
is
the
custom
in
that
sad
place
he
escaped
he
wandered
for
two
days
in
the
fields
at
liberty
if
being
at
liberty
is
to
be
hunted
to
turn
the
head
every
instant
to
quake
at
the
slightest
noise
to
be
afraid
of
everything
of
a
smoking
roof
of
a
passing
man
of
a
barking
dog
of
a
galloping
horse
of
a
striking
clock
of
the
day
because
one
can
see
of
the
night
because
one
cannot
see
of
the
highway
of
the
path
of
a
bush
of
sleep
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
he
was
captured
he
had
neither
eaten
nor
slept
for
thirty
six
hours
the
maritime
tribunal
condemned
him
for
this
crime
to
a
prolongation
of
his
term
for
three
years
which
made
eight
years
in
the
sixth
year
his
turn
to
escape
occurred
again
he
availed
himself
of
it
but
could
not
accomplish
his
flight
fully
he
was
missing
at
roll
call
the
cannon
were
fired
and
at
night
the
patrol
found
him
hidden
under
the
keel
of
a
vessel
in
process
of
construction
he
resisted
the
galley
guards
who
seized
him
escape
and
rebellion
this
case
provided
for
by
a
special
code
was
punished
by
an
addition
of
five
years
two
of
them
in
the
double
chain
thirteen
years
in
the
tenth
year
his
turn
came
round
again
he
again
profited
by
it
he
succeeded
no
better
three
years
for
this
fresh
attempt
sixteen
years
finally
i
think
it
was
during
his
thirteenth
year
he
made
a
last
attempt
and
only
succeeded
in
getting
retaken
at
the
end
of
four
hours
of
absence
three
years
for
those
four
hours
nineteen
years
in
october
1815
he
was
released
he
had
entered
there
in
1796
for
having
broken
a
pane
of
glass
and
taken
a
loaf
of
bread
room
for
a
brief
parenthesis
this
is
the
second
time
during
his
studies
on
the
penal
question
and
damnation
by
law
that
the
author
of
this
book
has
come
across
the
theft
of
a
loaf
of
bread
as
the
point
of
departure
for
the
disaster
of
a
destiny
claude
gueux
had
stolen
a
loaf
jean
valjean
had
stolen
a
loaf
english
statistics
prove
the
fact
that
four
thefts
out
of
five
in
london
have
hunger
for
their
immediate
cause
jean
valjean
had
entered
the
galleys
sobbing
and
shuddering
he
emerged
impassive
he
had
entered
in
despair
he
emerged
gloomy
what
had
taken
place
in
that
soul
chapter
vii
the
interior
of
despair
let
us
try
to
say
it
it
is
necessary
that
society
should
look
at
these
things
because
it
is
itself
which
creates
them
he
was
as
we
have
said
an
ignorant
man
but
he
was
not
a
fool
the
light
of
nature
was
ignited
in
him
unhappiness
which
also
possesses
a
clearness
of
vision
of
its
own
augmented
the
small
amount
of
daylight
which
existed
in
this
mind
beneath
the
cudgel
beneath
the
chain
in
the
cell
in
hardship
beneath
the
burning
sun
of
the
galleys
upon
the
plank
bed
of
the
convict
he
withdrew
into
his
own
consciousness
and
meditated
he
constituted
himself
the
tribunal
he
began
by
putting
himself
on
trial
he
recognized
the
fact
that
he
was
not
an
innocent
man
unjustly
punished
he
admitted
that
he
had
committed
an
extreme
and
blameworthy
act
that
that
loaf
of
bread
would
probably
not
have
been
refused
to
him
had
he
asked
for
it
that
in
any
case
it
would
have
been
better
to
wait
until
he
could
get
it
through
compassion
or
through
work
that
it
is
not
an
unanswerable
argument
to
say
can
one
wait
when
one
is
hungry
that
in
the
first
place
it
is
very
rare
for
any
one
to
die
of
hunger
literally
and
next
that
fortunately
or
unfortunately
man
is
so
constituted
that
he
can
suffer
long
and
much
both
morally
and
physically
without
dying
that
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
have
patience
that
that
would
even
have
been
better
for
those
poor
little
children
that
it
had
been
an
act
of
madness
for
him
a
miserable
unfortunate
wretch
to
take
society
at
large
violently
by
the
collar
and
to
imagine
that
one
can
escape
from
misery
through
theft
that
that
is
in
any
case
a
poor
door
through
which
to
escape
from
misery
through
which
infamy
enters
in
short
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
then
he
asked
himself
whether
he
had
been
the
only
one
in
fault
in
his
fatal
history
whether
it
was
not
a
serious
thing
that
he
a
laborer
out
of
work
that
he
an
industrious
man
should
have
lacked
bread
and
whether
the
fault
once
committed
and
confessed
the
chastisement
had
not
been
ferocious
and
disproportioned
whether
there
had
not
been
more
abuse
on
the
part
of
the
law
in
respect
to
the
penalty
than
there
had
been
on
the
part
of
the
culprit
in
respect
to
his
fault
whether
there
had
not
been
an
excess
of
weights
in
one
balance
of
the
scale
in
the
one
which
contains
expiation
whether
the
over
weight
of
the
penalty
was
not
equivalent
to
the
annihilation
of
the
crime
and
did
not
result
in
reversing
the
situation
of
replacing
the
fault
of
the
delinquent
by
the
fault
of
the
repression
of
converting
the
guilty
man
into
the
victim
and
the
debtor
into
the
creditor
and
of
ranging
the
law
definitely
on
the
side
of
the
man
who
had
violated
it
whether
this
penalty
complicated
by
successive
aggravations
for
attempts
at
escape
had
not
ended
in
becoming
a
sort
of
outrage
perpetrated
by
the
stronger
upon
the
feebler
a
crime
of
society
against
the
individual
a
crime
which
was
being
committed
afresh
every
day
a
crime
which
had
lasted
nineteen
years
he
asked
himself
whether
human
society
could
have
the
right
to
force
its
members
to
suffer
equally
in
one
case
for
its
own
unreasonable
lack
of
foresight
and
in
the
other
case
for
its
pitiless
foresight
and
to
seize
a
poor
man
forever
between
a
defect
and
an
excess
a
default
of
work
and
an
excess
of
punishment
whether
it
was
not
outrageous
for
society
to
treat
thus
precisely
those
of
its
members
who
were
the
least
well
endowed
in
the
division
of
goods
made
by
chance
and
consequently
the
most
deserving
of
consideration
these
questions
put
and
answered
he
judged
society
and
condemned
it
he
condemned
it
to
his
hatred
he
made
it
responsible
for
the
fate
which
he
was
suffering
and
he
said
to
himself
that
it
might
be
that
one
day
he
should
not
hesitate
to
call
it
to
account
he
declared
to
himself
that
there
was
no
equilibrium
between
the
harm
which
he
had
caused
and
the
harm
which
was
being
done
to
him
he
finally
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
his
punishment
was
not
in
truth
unjust
but
that
it
most
assuredly
was
iniquitous
anger
may
be
both
foolish
and
absurd
one
can
be
irritated
wrongfully
one
is
exasperated
only
when
there
is
some
show
of
right
on
one
s
side
at
bottom
jean
valjean
felt
himself
exasperated
and
besides
human
society
had
done
him
nothing
but
harm
he
had
never
seen
anything
of
it
save
that
angry
face
which
it
calls
justice
and
which
it
shows
to
those
whom
it
strikes
men
had
only
touched
him
to
bruise
him
every
contact
with
them
had
been
a
blow
never
since
his
infancy
since
the
days
of
his
mother
of
his
sister
had
he
ever
encountered
a
friendly
word
and
a
kindly
glance
from
suffering
to
suffering
he
had
gradually
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
life
is
a
war
and
that
in
this
war
he
was
the
conquered
he
had
no
other
weapon
than
his
hate
he
resolved
to
whet
it
in
the
galleys
and
to
bear
it
away
with
him
when
he
departed
there
was
at
toulon
a
school
for
the
convicts
kept
by
the
ignorantin
friars
where
the
most
necessary
branches
were
taught
to
those
of
the
unfortunate
men
who
had
a
mind
for
them
he
was
of
the
number
who
had
a
mind
he
went
to
school
at
the
age
of
forty
and
learned
to
read
to
write
to
cipher
he
felt
that
to
fortify
his
intelligence
was
to
fortify
his
hate
in
certain
cases
education
and
enlightenment
can
serve
to
eke
out
evil
this
is
a
sad
thing
to
say
after
having
judged
society
which
had
caused
his
unhappiness
he
judged
providence
which
had
made
society
and
he
condemned
it
also
thus
during
nineteen
years
of
torture
and
slavery
this
soul
mounted
and
at
the
same
time
fell
light
entered
it
on
one
side
and
darkness
on
the
other
jean
valjean
had
not
as
we
have
seen
an
evil
nature
he
was
still
good
when
he
arrived
at
the
galleys
he
there
condemned
society
and
felt
that
he
was
becoming
wicked
he
there
condemned
providence
and
was
conscious
that
he
was
becoming
impious
it
is
difficult
not
to
indulge
in
meditation
at
this
point
does
human
nature
thus
change
utterly
and
from
top
to
bottom
can
the
man
created
good
by
god
be
rendered
wicked
by
man
can
the
soul
be
completely
made
over
by
fate
and
become
evil
fate
being
evil
can
the
heart
become
misshapen
and
contract
incurable
deformities
and
infirmities
under
the
oppression
of
a
disproportionate
unhappiness
as
the
vertebral
column
beneath
too
low
a
vault
is
there
not
in
every
human
soul
was
there
not
in
the
soul
of
jean
valjean
in
particular
a
first
spark
a
divine
element
incorruptible
in
this
world
immortal
in
the
other
which
good
can
develop
fan
ignite
and
make
to
glow
with
splendor
and
which
evil
can
never
wholly
extinguish
grave
and
obscure
questions
to
the
last
of
which
every
physiologist
would
probably
have
responded
no
and
that
without
hesitation
had
he
beheld
at
toulon
during
the
hours
of
repose
which
were
for
jean
valjean
hours
of
revery
this
gloomy
galley
slave
seated
with
folded
arms
upon
the
bar
of
some
capstan
with
the
end
of
his
chain
thrust
into
his
pocket
to
prevent
its
dragging
serious
silent
and
thoughtful
a
pariah
of
the
laws
which
regarded
the
man
with
wrath
condemned
by
civilization
and
regarding
heaven
with
severity
certainly
and
we
make
no
attempt
to
dissimulate
the
fact
the
observing
physiologist
would
have
beheld
an
irremediable
misery
he
would
perchance
have
pitied
this
sick
man
of
the
law
s
making
but
he
would
not
have
even
essayed
any
treatment
he
would
have
turned
aside
his
gaze
from
the
caverns
of
which
he
would
have
caught
a
glimpse
within
this
soul
and
like
dante
at
the
portals
of
hell
he
would
have
effaced
from
this
existence
the
word
which
the
finger
of
god
has
nevertheless
inscribed
upon
the
brow
of
every
man
hope
was
this
state
of
his
soul
which
we
have
attempted
to
analyze
as
perfectly
clear
to
jean
valjean
as
we
have
tried
to
render
it
for
those
who
read
us
did
jean
valjean
distinctly
perceive
after
their
formation
and
had
he
seen
distinctly
during
the
process
of
their
formation
all
the
elements
of
which
his
moral
misery
was
composed
had
this
rough
and
unlettered
man
gathered
a
perfectly
clear
perception
of
the
succession
of
ideas
through
which
he
had
by
degrees
mounted
and
descended
to
the
lugubrious
aspects
which
had
for
so
many
years
formed
the
inner
horizon
of
his
spirit
was
he
conscious
of
all
that
passed
within
him
and
of
all
that
was
working
there
that
is
something
which
we
do
not
presume
to
state
it
is
something
which
we
do
not
even
believe
there
was
too
much
ignorance
in
jean
valjean
even
after
his
misfortune
to
prevent
much
vagueness
from
still
lingering
there
at
times
he
did
not
rightly
know
himself
what
he
felt
jean
valjean
was
in
the
shadows
he
suffered
in
the
shadows
he
hated
in
the
shadows
one
might
have
said
that
he
hated
in
advance
of
himself
he
dwelt
habitually
in
this
shadow
feeling
his
way
like
a
blind
man
and
a
dreamer
only
at
intervals
there
suddenly
came
to
him
from
without
and
from
within
an
access
of
wrath
a
surcharge
of
suffering
a
livid
and
rapid
flash
which
illuminated
his
whole
soul
and
caused
to
appear
abruptly
all
around
him
in
front
behind
amid
the
gleams
of
a
frightful
light
the
hideous
precipices
and
the
sombre
perspective
of
his
destiny
the
flash
passed
the
night
closed
in
again
and
where
was
he
he
no
longer
knew
the
peculiarity
of
pains
of
this
nature
in
which
that
which
is
pitiless
that
is
to
say
that
which
is
brutalizing
predominates
is
to
transform
a
man
little
by
little
by
a
sort
of
stupid
transfiguration
into
a
wild
beast
sometimes
into
a
ferocious
beast
jean
valjean
s
successive
and
obstinate
attempts
at
escape
would
alone
suffice
to
prove
this
strange
working
of
the
law
upon
the
human
soul
jean
valjean
would
have
renewed
these
attempts
utterly
useless
and
foolish
as
they
were
as
often
as
the
opportunity
had
presented
itself
without
reflecting
for
an
instant
on
the
result
nor
on
the
experiences
which
he
had
already
gone
through
he
escaped
impetuously
like
the
wolf
who
finds
his
cage
open
instinct
said
to
him
flee
reason
would
have
said
remain
but
in
the
presence
of
so
violent
a
temptation
reason
vanished
nothing
remained
but
instinct
the
beast
alone
acted
when
he
was
recaptured
the
fresh
severities
inflicted
on
him
only
served
to
render
him
still
more
wild
one
detail
which
we
must
not
omit
is
that
he
possessed
a
physical
strength
which
was
not
approached
by
a
single
one
of
the
denizens
of
the
galleys
at
work
at
paying
out
a
cable
or
winding
up
a
capstan
jean
valjean
was
worth
four
men
he
sometimes
lifted
and
sustained
enormous
weights
on
his
back
and
when
the
occasion
demanded
it
he
replaced
that
implement
which
is
called
a
jack
screw
and
was
formerly
called
orgueil
pride
whence
we
may
remark
in
passing
is
derived
the
name
of
the
rue
montorgueil
near
the
halles
fishmarket
in
paris
his
comrades
had
nicknamed
him
jean
the
jack
screw
once
when
they
were
repairing
the
balcony
of
the
town
hall
at
toulon
one
of
those
admirable
caryatids
of
puget
which
support
the
balcony
became
loosened
and
was
on
the
point
of
falling
jean
valjean
who
was
present
supported
the
caryatid
with
his
shoulder
and
gave
the
workmen
time
to
arrive
his
suppleness
even
exceeded
his
strength
certain
convicts
who
were
forever
dreaming
of
escape
ended
by
making
a
veritable
science
of
force
and
skill
combined
it
is
the
science
of
muscles
an
entire
system
of
mysterious
statics
is
daily
practised
by
prisoners
men
who
are
forever
envious
of
the
flies
and
birds
to
climb
a
vertical
surface
and
to
find
points
of
support
where
hardly
a
projection
was
visible
was
play
to
jean
valjean
an
angle
of
the
wall
being
given
with
the
tension
of
his
back
and
legs
with
his
elbows
and
his
heels
fitted
into
the
unevenness
of
the
stone
he
raised
himself
as
if
by
magic
to
the
third
story
he
sometimes
mounted
thus
even
to
the
roof
of
the
galley
prison
he
spoke
but
little
he
laughed
not
at
all
an
excessive
emotion
was
required
to
wring
from
him
once
or
twice
a
year
that
lugubrious
laugh
of
the
convict
which
is
like
the
echo
of
the
laugh
of
a
demon
to
all
appearance
he
seemed
to
be
occupied
in
the
constant
contemplation
of
something
terrible
he
was
absorbed
in
fact
athwart
the
unhealthy
perceptions
of
an
incomplete
nature
and
a
crushed
intelligence
he
was
confusedly
conscious
that
some
monstrous
thing
was
resting
on
him
in
that
obscure
and
wan
shadow
within
which
he
crawled
each
time
that
he
turned
his
neck
and
essayed
to
raise
his
glance
he
perceived
with
terror
mingled
with
rage
a
sort
of
frightful
accumulation
of
things
collecting
and
mounting
above
him
beyond
the
range
of
his
vision
laws
prejudices
men
and
deeds
whose
outlines
escaped
him
whose
mass
terrified
him
and
which
was
nothing
else
than
that
prodigious
pyramid
which
we
call
civilization
he
distinguished
here
and
there
in
that
swarming
and
formless
mass
now
near
him
now
afar
off
and
on
inaccessible
table
lands
some
group
some
detail
vividly
illuminated
here
the
galley
sergeant
and
his
cudgel
there
the
gendarme
and
his
sword
yonder
the
mitred
archbishop
away
at
the
top
like
a
sort
of
sun
the
emperor
crowned
and
dazzling
it
seemed
to
him
that
these
distant
splendors
far
from
dissipating
his
night
rendered
it
more
funereal
and
more
black
all
this
laws
prejudices
deeds
men
things
went
and
came
above
him
over
his
head
in
accordance
with
the
complicated
and
mysterious
movement
which
god
imparts
to
civilization
walking
over
him
and
crushing
him
with
i
know
not
what
peacefulness
in
its
cruelty
and
inexorability
in
its
indifference
souls
which
have
fallen
to
the
bottom
of
all
possible
misfortune
unhappy
men
lost
in
the
lowest
of
those
limbos
at
which
no
one
any
longer
looks
the
reproved
of
the
law
feel
the
whole
weight
of
this
human
society
so
formidable
for
him
who
is
without
so
frightful
for
him
who
is
beneath
resting
upon
their
heads
in
this
situation
jean
valjean
meditated
and
what
could
be
the
nature
of
his
meditation
if
the
grain
of
millet
beneath
the
millstone
had
thoughts
it
would
doubtless
think
that
same
thing
which
jean
valjean
thought
all
these
things
realities
full
of
spectres
phantasmagories
full
of
realities
had
eventually
created
for
him
a
sort
of
interior
state
which
is
almost
indescribable
at
times
amid
his
convict
toil
he
paused
he
fell
to
thinking
his
reason
at
one
and
the
same
time
riper
and
more
troubled
than
of
yore
rose
in
revolt
everything
which
had
happened
to
him
seemed
to
him
absurd
everything
that
surrounded
him
seemed
to
him
impossible
he
said
to
himself
it
is
a
dream
he
gazed
at
the
galley
sergeant
standing
a
few
paces
from
him
the
galley
sergeant
seemed
a
phantom
to
him
all
of
a
sudden
the
phantom
dealt
him
a
blow
with
his
cudgel
visible
nature
hardly
existed
for
him
it
would
almost
be
true
to
say
that
there
existed
for
jean
valjean
neither
sun
nor
fine
summer
days
nor
radiant
sky
nor
fresh
april
dawns
i
know
not
what
vent
hole
daylight
habitually
illumined
his
soul
to
sum
up
in
conclusion
that
which
can
be
summed
up
and
translated
into
positive
results
in
all
that
we
have
just
pointed
out
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
the
statement
that
in
the
course
of
nineteen
years
jean
valjean
the
inoffensive
tree
pruner
of
faverolles
the
formidable
convict
of
toulon
had
become
capable
thanks
to
the
manner
in
which
the
galleys
had
moulded
him
of
two
sorts
of
evil
action
firstly
of
evil
action
which
was
rapid
unpremeditated
dashing
entirely
instinctive
in
the
nature
of
reprisals
for
the
evil
which
he
had
undergone
secondly
of
evil
action
which
was
serious
grave
consciously
argued
out
and
premeditated
with
the
false
ideas
which
such
a
misfortune
can
furnish
his
deliberate
deeds
passed
through
three
successive
phases
which
natures
of
a
certain
stamp
can
alone
traverse
reasoning
will
perseverance
he
had
for
moving
causes
his
habitual
wrath
bitterness
of
soul
a
profound
sense
of
indignities
suffered
the
reaction
even
against
the
good
the
innocent
and
the
just
if
there
are
any
such
the
point
of
departure
like
the
point
of
arrival
for
all
his
thoughts
was
hatred
of
human
law
that
hatred
which
if
it
be
not
arrested
in
its
development
by
some
providential
incident
becomes
within
a
given
time
the
hatred
of
society
then
the
hatred
of
the
human
race
then
the
hatred
of
creation
and
which
manifests
itself
by
a
vague
incessant
and
brutal
desire
to
do
harm
to
some
living
being
no
matter
whom
it
will
be
perceived
that
it
was
not
without
reason
that
jean
valjean
s
passport
described
him
as
a
very
dangerous
man
from
year
to
year
this
soul
had
dried
away
slowly
but
with
fatal
sureness
when
the
heart
is
dry
the
eye
is
dry
on
his
departure
from
the
galleys

had
been

years

chapter
ix
new
troubles
when
the
hour
came
for
him
to
take
his
departure
from
the
galleys
when
jean
valjean
heard
in
his
ear
the
strange
words
thou
art
free
the
moment
seemed
improbable
and
unprecedented
a
ray
of
vivid
light
a
ray
of
the
true
light
of
the
living
suddenly
penetrated
within
him
but
it
was
not
long
before
this
ray
paled
jean
valjean
had
been
dazzled
by
the
idea
of
liberty
he
had
believed
in
a
new
life
he
very
speedily
perceived
what
sort
of
liberty
it
is
to
which
a
yellow
passport
is
provided
and
this
was
encompassed
with
much
bitterness
he
had
calculated
that
his
earnings
during
his
sojourn
in
the
galleys
ought
to
amount
to
a
hundred
and
seventy
one
francs
it
is
but
just
to
add
that
he
had
forgotten
to
include
in
his
calculations
the
forced
repose
of
sundays
and
festival
days
during
nineteen
years
which
entailed
a
diminution
of
about
eighty
francs
at
all
events
his
hoard
had
been
reduced
by
various
local
levies
to
the
sum
of
one
hundred
and
nine
francs
fifteen
sous
which
had
been
counted
out
to
him
on
his
departure
he
had
understood
nothing
of
this
and
had
thought
himself
wronged
let
us
say
the
word
robbed
on
the
day
following
his
liberation
he
saw
at
grasse
in
front
of
an
orange
flower
distillery
some
men
engaged
in
unloading
bales
he
offered
his
services
business
was
pressing
they
were
accepted
he
set
to
work
he
was
intelligent
robust
adroit
he
did
his
best
the
master
seemed
pleased
while
he
was
at
work
a
gendarme
passed
observed
him
and
demanded
his
papers
it
was
necessary
to
show
him
the
yellow
passport
that
done
jean
valjean
resumed
his
labor
a
little
while
before
he
had
questioned
one
of
the
workmen
as
to
the
amount
which
they
earned
each
day
at
this
occupation
he
had
been
told
thirty
sous
when
evening
arrived
as
he
was
forced
to
set
out
again
on
the
following
day
he
presented
himself
to
the
owner
of
the
distillery
and
requested
to
be
paid
the
owner
did
not
utter
a
word
but
handed
him
fifteen
sous
he
objected
he
was
told
that
is
enough
for
thee
he
persisted
the
master
looked
him
straight
between
the
eyes
and
said
to
him
beware
of
the
prison
there
again
he
considered
that
he
had
been
robbed
society
the
state
by
diminishing
his
hoard
had
robbed
him
wholesale
now
it
was
the
individual
who
was
robbing
him
at
retail
liberation
is
not
deliverance
one
gets
free
from
the
galleys
but
not
from
the
sentence
that
is
what
happened
to
him
at
grasse
we
have
seen
in
what
manner
he
was
received
at
d
chapter
x
the
man
aroused
as
the
cathedral
clock
struck
two
in
the
morning
jean
valjean
awoke
what
woke
him
was
that
his
bed
was
too
good
it
was
nearly
twenty
years
since
he
had
slept
in
a
bed
and
although
he
had
not
undressed
the
sensation
was
too
novel
not
to
disturb
his
slumbers
he
had
slept
more
than
four
hours
his
fatigue
had
passed
away
he
was
accustomed
not
to
devote
many
hours
to
repose
he
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
into
the
gloom
which
surrounded
him
then
he
closed
them
again
with
the
intention
of
going
to
sleep
once
more
when
many
varied
sensations
have
agitated
the
day
when
various
matters
preoccupy
the
mind
one
falls
asleep
once
but
not
a
second
time
sleep
comes
more
easily
than
it
returns
this
is
what
happened
to
jean
valjean
he
could
not
get
to
sleep
again
and
he
fell
to
thinking
he
was
at
one
of
those
moments
when
the
thoughts
which
one
has
in
one
s
mind
are
troubled
there
was
a
sort
of
dark
confusion
in
his
brain
his
memories
of
the
olden
time
and
of
the
immediate
present
floated
there
pell
mell
and
mingled
confusedly
losing
their
proper
forms
becoming
disproportionately
large
then
suddenly
disappearing
as
in
a
muddy
and
perturbed
pool
many
thoughts
occurred
to
him
but
there
was
one
which
kept
constantly
presenting
itself
afresh
and
which
drove
away
all
others
we
will
mention
this
thought
at
once
he
had
observed
the
six
sets
of
silver
forks
and
spoons
and
the
ladle
which
madame
magloire
had
placed
on
the
table
those
six
sets
of
silver
haunted
him
they
were
there
a
few
paces
distant
just
as
he
was
traversing
the
adjoining
room
to
reach
the
one
in
which
he
then
was
the
old
servant
woman
had
been
in
the
act
of
placing
them
in
a
little
cupboard
near
the
head
of
the
bed
he
had
taken
careful
note
of
this
cupboard
on
the
right
as
you
entered
from
the
dining
room
they
were
solid
and
old
silver
from
the
ladle
one
could
get
at
least
two
hundred
francs
double
what
he
had
earned
in
nineteen
years
it
is
true
that
he
would
have
earned
more
if
the
administration
had
not
robbed
him
his
mind
wavered
for
a
whole
hour
in
fluctuations
with
which
there
was
certainly
mingled
some
struggle
three
o
clock
struck
he
opened
his
eyes
again
drew
himself
up
abruptly
into
a
sitting
posture
stretched
out
his
arm
and
felt
of
his
knapsack
which
he
had
thrown
down
on
a
corner
of
the
alcove
then
he
hung
his
legs
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
placed
his
feet
on
the
floor
and
thus
found
himself
almost
without
knowing
it
seated
on
his
bed
he
remained
for
a
time
thoughtfully
in
this
attitude
which
would
have
been
suggestive
of
something
sinister
for
any
one
who
had
seen
him
thus
in
the
dark
the
only
person
awake
in
that
house
where
all
were
sleeping
all
of
a
sudden
he
stooped
down
removed
his
shoes
and
placed
them
softly
on
the
mat
beside
the
bed
then
he
resumed
his
thoughtful
attitude
and
became
motionless
once
more
throughout
this
hideous
meditation
the
thoughts
which
we
have
above
indicated
moved
incessantly
through
his
brain
entered
withdrew
re
entered
and
in
a
manner
oppressed
him
and
then
he
thought
also
without
knowing
why
and
with
the
mechanical
persistence
of
revery
of
a
convict
named
brevet
whom
he
had
known
in
the
galleys
and
whose
trousers
had
been
upheld
by
a
single
suspender
of
knitted
cotton
the
checkered
pattern
of
that
suspender
recurred
incessantly
to
his
mind
he
remained
in
this
situation
and
would
have
so
remained
indefinitely
even
until
daybreak
had
not
the
clock
struck
one
the
half
or
quarter
hour
it
seemed
to
him
that
that
stroke
said
to
him
come
on
he
rose
to
his
feet
hesitated
still
another
moment
and
listened
all
was
quiet
in
the
house
then
he
walked
straight
ahead
with
short
steps
to
the
window
of
which
he
caught
a
glimpse
the
night
was
not
very
dark
there
was
a
full
moon
across
which
coursed
large
clouds
driven
by
the
wind
this
created
outdoors
alternate
shadow
and
gleams
of
light
eclipses
then
bright
openings
of
the
clouds
and
indoors
a
sort
of
twilight
this
twilight
sufficient
to
enable
a
person
to
see
his
way
intermittent
on
account
of
the
clouds
resembled
the
sort
of
livid
light
which
falls
through
an
air
hole
in
a
cellar
before
which
the
passersby
come
and
go
on
arriving
at
the
window
jean
valjean
examined
it
it
had
no
grating
it
opened
in
the
garden
and
was
fastened
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
country
only
by
a
small
pin
he
opened
it
but
as
a
rush
of
cold
and
piercing
air
penetrated
the
room
abruptly
he
closed
it
again
immediately
he
scrutinized
the
garden
with
that
attentive
gaze
which
studies
rather
than
looks
the
garden
was
enclosed
by
a
tolerably
low
white
wall
easy
to
climb
far
away
at
the
extremity
he
perceived
tops
of
trees
spaced
at
regular
intervals
which
indicated
that
the
wall
separated
the
garden
from
an
avenue
or
lane
planted
with
trees
having
taken
this
survey
he
executed
a
movement
like
that
of
a
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
strode
to
his
alcove
grasped
his
knapsack
opened
it
fumbled
in
it
pulled
out
of
it
something
which
he
placed
on
the
bed
put
his
shoes
into
one
of
his
pockets
shut
the
whole
thing
up
again
threw
the
knapsack
on
his
shoulders
put
on
his
cap
drew
the
visor
down
over
his
eyes
felt
for
his
cudgel
went
and
placed
it
in
the
angle
of
the
window
then
returned
to
the
bed
and
resolutely
seized
the
object
which
he
had
deposited
there
it
resembled
a
short
bar
of
iron
pointed
like
a
pike
at
one
end
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
distinguish
in
that
darkness
for
what
employment
that
bit
of
iron
could
have
been
designed
perhaps
it
was
a
lever
possibly
it
was
a
club
in
the
daytime
it
would
have
been
possible
to
recognize
it
as
nothing
more
than
a
miner
s
candlestick
convicts
were
at
that
period
sometimes
employed
in
quarrying
stone
from
the
lofty
hills
which
environ
toulon
and
it
was
not
rare
for
them
to
have
miners
tools
at
their
command
these
miners
candlesticks
are
of
massive
iron
terminated
at
the
lower
extremity
by
a
point
by
means
of
which
they
are
stuck
into
the
rock
he
took
the
candlestick
in
his
right
hand
holding
his
breath
and
trying
to
deaden
the
sound
of
his
tread
he
directed
his
steps
to
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
occupied
by
the
bishop
as
we
already
know
on
arriving
at
this
door
he
found
it
ajar
the
bishop
had
not
closed
it
chapter
xi
what
he
does
jean
valjean
listened
not
a
sound
he
gave
the
door
a
push
he
pushed
it
gently
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
lightly
with
the
furtive
and
uneasy
gentleness
of
a
cat
which
is
desirous
of
entering
the
door
yielded
to
this
pressure
and
made
an
imperceptible
and
silent
movement
which
enlarged
the
opening
a
little
he
waited
a
moment
then
gave
the
door
a
second
and
a
bolder
push
it
continued
to
yield
in
silence
the
opening
was
now
large
enough
to
allow
him
to
pass
but
near
the
door
there
stood
a
little
table
which
formed
an
embarrassing
angle
with
it
and
barred
the
entrance
jean
valjean
recognized
the
difficulty
it
was
necessary
at
any
cost
to
enlarge
the
aperture
still
further
he
decided
on
his
course
of
action
and
gave
the
door
a
third
push
more
energetic
than
the
two
preceding
this
time
a
badly
oiled
hinge
suddenly
emitted
amid
the
silence
a
hoarse
and
prolonged
cry
jean
valjean
shuddered
the
noise
of
the
hinge
rang
in
his
ears
with
something
of
the
piercing
and
formidable
sound
of
the
trump
of
the
day
of
judgment
in
the
fantastic
exaggerations
of
the
first
moment
he
almost
imagined
that
that
hinge
had
just
become
animated
and
had
suddenly
assumed
a
terrible
life
and
that
it
was
barking
like
a
dog
to
arouse
every
one
and
warn
and
to
wake
those
who
were
asleep
he
halted
shuddering
bewildered
and
fell
back
from
the
tips
of
his
toes
upon
his
heels
he
heard
the
arteries
in
his
temples
beating
like
two
forge
hammers
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
breath
issued
from
his
breast
with
the
roar
of
the
wind
issuing
from
a
cavern
it
seemed
impossible
to
him
that
the
horrible
clamor
of
that
irritated
hinge
should
not
have
disturbed
the
entire
household
like
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
the
door
pushed
by
him
had
taken
the
alarm
and
had
shouted
the
old
man
would
rise
at
once
the
two
old
women
would
shriek
out
people
would
come
to
their
assistance
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
town
would
be
in
an
uproar
and
the
gendarmerie
on
hand
for
a
moment
he
thought
himself
lost
he
remained
where
he
was
petrified
like
the
statue
of
salt
not
daring
to
make
a
movement
several
minutes
elapsed
the
door
had
fallen
wide
open
he
ventured
to
peep
into
the
next
room
nothing
had
stirred
there
he
lent
an
ear
nothing
was
moving
in
the
house
the
noise
made
by
the
rusty
hinge
had
not
awakened
any
one
this
first
danger
was
past
but
there
still
reigned
a
frightful
tumult
within
him
nevertheless
he
did
not
retreat
even
when
he
had
thought
himself
lost
he
had
not
drawn
back
his
only
thought
now
was
to
finish
as
soon
as
possible
he
took
a
step
and
entered
the
room
this
room
was
in
a
state
of
perfect
calm
here
and
there
vague
and
confused
forms
were
distinguishable
which
in
the
daylight
were
papers
scattered
on
a
table
open
folios
volumes
piled
upon
a
stool
an
arm
chair
heaped
with
clothing
a
prie
dieu
and
which
at
that
hour
were
only
shadowy
corners
and
whitish
spots
jean
valjean
advanced
with
precaution
taking
care
not
to
knock
against
the
furniture
he
could
hear
at
the
extremity
of
the
room
the
even
and
tranquil
breathing
of
the
sleeping
bishop
he
suddenly
came
to
a
halt
he
was
near
the
bed
he
had
arrived
there
sooner
than
he
had
thought
for
nature
sometimes
mingles
her
effects
and
her
spectacles
with
our
actions
with
sombre
and
intelligent
appropriateness
as
though
she
desired
to
make
us
reflect
for
the
last
half
hour
a
large
cloud
had
covered
the
heavens
at
the
moment
when
jean
valjean
paused
in
front
of
the
bed
this
cloud
parted
as
though
on
purpose
and
a
ray
of
light
traversing
the
long
window
suddenly
illuminated
the
bishop
s
pale
face
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
he
lay
in
his
bed
almost
completely
dressed
on
account
of
the
cold
of
the
basses
alps
in
a
garment
of
brown
wool
which
covered
his
arms
to
the
wrists
his
head
was
thrown
back
on
the
pillow
in
the
careless
attitude
of
repose
his
hand
adorned
with
the
pastoral
ring
and
whence
had
fallen
so
many
good
deeds
and
so
many
holy
actions
was
hanging
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
his
whole
face
was
illumined
with
a
vague
expression
of
satisfaction
of
hope
and
of
felicity
it
was
more
than
a
smile
and
almost
a
radiance
he
bore
upon
his
brow
the
indescribable
reflection
of
a
light
which
was
invisible
the
soul
of
the
just
contemplates
in
sleep
a
mysterious
heaven
a
reflection
of
that
heaven
rested
on
the
bishop
it
was
at
the
same
time
a
luminous
transparency
for
that
heaven
was
within
him
that
heaven
was
his
conscience
illustration
the
fall

the
fall
at
the
moment
when
the
ray
of
moonlight
superposed
itself
so
to
speak
upon
that
inward
radiance
the
sleeping
bishop
seemed
as
in
a
glory
it
remained
however
gentle
and
veiled
in
an
ineffable
half
light
that
moon
in
the
sky
that
slumbering
nature
that
garden
without
a
quiver
that
house
which
was
so
calm
the
hour
the
moment
the
silence
added
some
solemn
and
unspeakable
quality
to
the
venerable
repose
of
this
man
and
enveloped
in
a
sort
of
serene
and
majestic
aureole
that
white
hair
those
closed
eyes
that
face
in
which
all
was
hope
and
all
was
confidence
that
head
of
an
old
man
and
that
slumber
of
an
infant
there
was
something
almost
divine
in
this
man
who
was
thus
august
without
being
himself
aware
of
it
jean
valjean
was
in
the
shadow
and
stood
motionless
with
his
iron
candlestick
in
his
hand
frightened
by
this
luminous
old
man
never
had
he
beheld
anything
like
this
this
confidence
terrified
him
the
moral
world
has
no
grander
spectacle
than
this
a
troubled
and
uneasy
conscience
which
has
arrived
on
the
brink
of
an
evil
action
contemplating
the
slumber
of
the
just
that
slumber
in
that
isolation
and
with
a
neighbor
like
himself
had
about
it
something
sublime
of
which
he
was
vaguely
but
imperiously
conscious
no
one
could
have
told
what
was
passing
within
him
not
even
himself
in
order
to
attempt
to
form
an
idea
of
it
it
is
necessary
to
think
of
the
most
violent
of
things
in
the
presence
of
the
most
gentle
even
on
his
visage
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
with
certainty
it
was
a
sort
of
haggard
astonishment
he
gazed
at
it
and
that
was
all
but
what
was
his
thought
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
divine
it
what
was
evident
was
that
he
was
touched
and
astounded
but
what
was
the
nature
of
this
emotion
his
eye
never
quitted
the
old
man
the
only
thing
which
was
clearly
to
be
inferred
from
his
attitude
and
his
physiognomy
was
a
strange
indecision
one
would
have
said
that
he
was
hesitating
between
the
two
abysses
the
one
in
which
one
loses
one
s
self
and
that
in
which
one
saves
one
s
self
he
seemed
prepared
to
crush
that
skull
or
to
kiss
that
hand
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
his
left
arm
rose
slowly
towards
his
brow
and
he
took
off
his
cap
then
his
arm
fell
back
with
the
same
deliberation
and
jean
valjean
fell
to
meditating
once
more
his
cap
in
his
left
hand
his
club
in
his
right
hand
his
hair
bristling
all
over
his
savage
head
the
bishop
continued
to
sleep
in
profound
peace
beneath
that
terrifying
gaze
the
gleam
of
the
moon
rendered
confusedly
visible
the
crucifix
over
the
chimney
piece
which
seemed
to
be
extending
its
arms
to
both
of
them
with
a
benediction
for
one
and
pardon
for
the
other
suddenly
jean
valjean
replaced
his
cap
on
his
brow
then
stepped
rapidly
past
the
bed
without
glancing
at
the
bishop
straight
to
the
cupboard
which
he
saw
near
the
head
he
raised
his
iron
candlestick
as
though
to
force
the
lock
the
key
was
there
he
opened
it
the
first
thing
which
presented
itself
to
him
was
the
basket
of
silverware
he
seized
it
traversed
the
chamber
with
long
strides
without
taking
any
precautions
and
without
troubling
himself
about
the
noise
gained
the
door
re
entered
the
oratory
opened
the
window
seized
his
cudgel
bestrode
the
window
sill
of
the
ground
floor
put
the
silver
into
his
knapsack
threw
away
the
basket
crossed
the
garden
leaped
over
the
wall
like
a
tiger
and
fled

the
bishop
works
the
next
morning
at
sunrise
monseigneur
bienvenu
was
strolling
in
his
garden
madame
magloire
ran
up
to
him
in
utter
consternation
monseigneur
monseigneur
she
exclaimed
does
your
grace
know
where
the
basket
of
silver
is
yes
replied
the
bishop
jesus
the
lord
be
blessed
she
resumed
i
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
it
the
bishop
had
just
picked
up
the
basket
in
a
flower
bed
he
presented
it
to
madame
magloire
here
it
is
well
said
she
nothing
in
it
and
the
silver
ah
returned
the
bishop
so
it
is
the
silver
which
troubles
you
i
don
t
know
where
it
is
great
good
god
it
is
stolen
that
man
who
was
here
last
night
has
stolen
it
in
a
twinkling
with
all
the
vivacity
of
an
alert
old
woman
madame
magloire
had
rushed
to
the
oratory
entered
the
alcove
and
returned
to
the
bishop
the
bishop
had
just
bent
down
and
was
sighing
as
he
examined
a
plant
of
cochlearia
des
guillons
which
the
basket
had
broken
as
it
fell
across
the
bed
he
rose
up
at
madame
magloire
s
cry
monseigneur
the
man
is
gone
the
silver
has
been
stolen
as
she
uttered
this
exclamation
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
corner
of
the
garden
where
traces
of
the
wall
having
been
scaled
were
visible
the
coping
of
the
wall
had
been
torn
away
stay
yonder
is
the
way
he
went
he
jumped
over
into
cochefilet
lane
ah
the
abomination
he
has
stolen
our
silver
the
bishop
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
raised
his
grave
eyes
and
said
gently
to
madame
magloire
and
in
the
first
place
was
that
silver
ours
madame
magloire
was
speechless
another
silence
ensued
then
the
bishop
went
on
madame
magloire
i
have
for
a
long
time
detained
that
silver
wrongfully
it
belonged
to
the
poor
who
was
that
man
a
poor
man
evidently
alas
jesus
returned
madame
magloire
it
is
not
for
my
sake
nor
for
mademoiselle
s
it
makes
no
difference
to
us
but
it
is
for
the
sake
of
monseigneur
what
is
monseigneur
to
eat
with
now
the
bishop
gazed
at
her
with
an
air
of
amazement
ah
come
are
there
no
such
things
as
pewter
forks
and
spoons
madame
magloire
shrugged
her
shoulders
pewter
has
an
odor
iron
forks
and
spoons
then
madame
magloire
made
an
expressive
grimace
iron
has
a
taste
very
well
said
the
bishop
wooden
ones
then
a
few
moments
later
he
was
breakfasting
at
the
very
table
at
which
jean
valjean
had
sat
on
the
previous
evening
as
he
ate
his
breakfast
monseigneur
welcome
remarked
gayly
to
his
sister
who
said
nothing
and
to
madame
magloire
who
was
grumbling
under
her
breath
that
one
really
does
not
need
either
fork
or
spoon
even
of
wood
in
order
to
dip
a
bit
of
bread
in
a
cup
of
milk
a
pretty
idea
truly
said
madame
magloire
to
herself
as
she
went
and
came
to
take
in
a
man
like
that
and
to
lodge
him
close
to
one
s
self
and
how
fortunate
that
he
did
nothing
but
steal
ah
mon
dieu
it
makes
one
shudder
to
think
of
it
as
the
brother
and
sister
were
about
to
rise
from
the
table
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
said
the
bishop
the
door
opened
a
singular
and
violent
group
made
its
appearance
on
the
threshold
three
men
were
holding
a
fourth
man
by
the
collar
the
three
men
were
gendarmes
the
other
was
jean
valjean
a
brigadier
of
gendarmes
who
seemed
to
be
in
command
of
the
group
was
standing
near
the
door
he
entered
and
advanced
to
the
bishop
making
a
military
salute
monseigneur
said
he
at
this
word
jean
valjean
who
was
dejected
and
seemed
overwhelmed
raised
his
head
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
monseigneur
he
murmured
so
he
is
not
the
cure
silence
said
the
gendarme
he
is
monseigneur
the
bishop
in
the
meantime
monseigneur
bienvenu
had
advanced
as
quickly
as
his
great
age
permitted
ah
here
you
are
he
exclaimed
looking
at
jean
valjean
i
am
glad
to
see
you
well
but
how
is
this
i
gave
you
the
candlesticks
too
which
are
of
silver
like
the
rest
and
for
which
you
can
certainly
get
two
hundred
francs
why
did
you
not
carry
them
away
with
your
forks
and
spoons
jean
valjean
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
stared
at
the
venerable
bishop
with
an
expression
which
no
human
tongue
can
render
any
account
of
monseigneur
said
the
brigadier
of
gendarmes
so
what
this
man
said
is
true
then
we
came
across
him
he
was
walking
like
a
man
who
is
running
away
we
stopped
him
to
look
into
the
matter
he
had
this
silver
and
he
told
you
interposed
the
bishop
with
a
smile
that
it
had
been
given
to
him
by
a
kind
old
fellow
of
a
priest
with
whom
he
had
passed
the
night
i
see
how
the
matter
stands
and
you
have
brought
him
back
here
it
is
a
mistake
in
that
case
replied
the
brigadier
we
can
let
him
go
certainly
replied
the
bishop
the
gendarmes
released
jean
valjean
who
recoiled
is
it
true
that
i
am
to
be
released
he
said
in
an
almost
inarticulate
voice
and
as
though
he
were
talking
in
his
sleep
yes
thou
art
released
dost
thou
not
understand
said
one
of
the
gendarmes
my
friend
resumed
the
bishop
before
you
go
here
are
your
candlesticks
take
them
he
stepped
to
the
chimney
piece
took
the
two
silver
candlesticks
and
brought
them
to
jean
valjean
the
two
women
looked
on
without
uttering
a
word
without
a
gesture
without
a
look
which
could
disconcert
the
bishop
jean
valjean
was
trembling
in
every
limb
he
took
the
two
candlesticks
mechanically
and
with
a
bewildered
air
now
said
the
bishop
go
in
peace
by
the
way
when
you
return
my
friend
it
is
not
necessary
to
pass
through
the
garden
you
can
always
enter
and
depart
through
the
street
door
it
is
never
fastened
with
anything
but
a
latch
either
by
day
or
by
night
then
turning
to
the
gendarmes
you
may
retire
gentlemen
the
gendarmes
retired
jean
valjean
was
like
a
man
on
the
point
of
fainting
the
bishop
drew
near
to
him
and
said
in
a
low
voice
do
not
forget
never
forget
that
you
have
promised
to
use
this
money
in
becoming
an
honest
man
jean
valjean
who
had
no
recollection
of
ever
having
promised
anything
remained
speechless
the
bishop
had
emphasized
the
words
when
he
uttered
them
he
resumed
with
solemnity
jean
valjean
my
brother
you
no
longer
belong
to
evil
but
to
good
it
is
your
soul
that
i
buy
from
you
i
withdraw
it
from
black
thoughts
and
the
spirit
of
perdition
and
i
give
it
to
god
chapter
xiii
little
gervais
jean
valjean
left
the
town
as
though
he
were
fleeing
from
it
he
set
out
at
a
very
hasty
pace
through
the
fields
taking
whatever
roads
and
paths
presented
themselves
to
him
without
perceiving
that
he
was
incessantly
retracing
his
steps
he
wandered
thus
the
whole
morning
without
having
eaten
anything
and
without
feeling
hungry
he
was
the
prey
of
a
throng
of
novel
sensations
he
was
conscious
of
a
sort
of
rage
he
did
not
know
against
whom
it
was
directed
he
could
not
have
told
whether
he
was
touched
or
humiliated
there
came
over
him
at
moments
a
strange
emotion
which
he
resisted
and
to
which
he
opposed
the
hardness
acquired
during
the
last
twenty
years
of
his
life
this
state
of
mind
fatigued
him
he
perceived
with
dismay
that
the
sort
of
frightful
calm
which
the
injustice
of
his
misfortune
had
conferred
upon
him
was
giving
way
within
him
he
asked
himself
what
would
replace
this
at
times
he
would
have
actually
preferred
to
be
in
prison
with
the
gendarmes
and
that
things
should
not
have
happened
in
this
way
it
would
have
agitated
him
less
although
the
season
was
tolerably
far
advanced
there
were
still
a
few
late
flowers
in
the
hedge
rows
here
and
there
whose
odor
as
he
passed
through
them
in
his
march
recalled
to
him
memories
of
his
childhood
these
memories
were
almost
intolerable
to
him
it
was
so
long
since
they
had
recurred
to
him
unutterable
thoughts
assembled
within
him
in
this
manner
all
day
long
as
the
sun
declined
to
its
setting
casting
long
shadows
athwart
the
soil
from
every
pebble
jean
valjean
sat
down
behind
a
bush
upon
a
large
ruddy
plain
which
was
absolutely
deserted
there
was
nothing
on
the
horizon
except
the
alps
not
even
the
spire
of
a
distant
village
jean
valjean
might
have
been
three
leagues
distant
from
d
a
path
which
intersected
the
plain
passed
a
few
paces
from
the
bush
in
the
middle
of
this
meditation
which
would
have
contributed
not
a
little
to
render
his
rags
terrifying
to
any
one
who
might
have
encountered
him
a
joyous
sound
became
audible
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
a
little
savoyard
about
ten
years
of
age
coming
up
the
path
and
singing
his
hurdy
gurdy
on
his
hip
and
his
marmot
box
on
his
back
one
of
those
gay
and
gentle
children
who
go
from
land
to
land
affording
a
view
of
their
knees
through
the
holes
in
their
trousers
without
stopping
his
song
the
lad
halted
in
his
march
from
time
to
time
and
played
at
knuckle
bones
with
some
coins
which
he
had
in
his
hand
his
whole
fortune
probably
among
this
money
there
was
one
forty
sou
piece
the
child
halted
beside
the
bush
without
perceiving
jean
valjean
and
tossed
up
his
handful
of
sous
which
up
to
that
time
he
had
caught
with
a
good
deal
of
adroitness
on
the
back
of
his
hand
this
time
the
forty
sou
piece
escaped
him
and
went
rolling
towards
the
brushwood
until
it
reached
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
set
his
foot
upon
it
in
the
meantime
the
child
had
looked
after
his
coin
and
had
caught
sight
of
him
he
showed
no
astonishment
but
walked
straight
up
to
the
man
the
spot
was
absolutely
solitary
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
was
not
a
person
on
the
plain
or
on
the
path
the
only
sound
was
the
tiny
feeble
cries
of
a
flock
of
birds
of
passage
which
was
traversing
the
heavens
at
an
immense
height
the
child
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
sun
which
cast
threads
of
gold
in
his
hair
and
empurpled
with
its
blood
red
gleam
the
savage
face
of
jean
valjean
sir
said
the
little
savoyard
with
that
childish
confidence
which
is
composed
of
ignorance
and
innocence
my
money
what
is
your
name
said
jean
valjean
little
gervais
sir
go
away
said
jean
valjean
sir
resumed
the
child
give
me
back
my
money
jean
valjean
dropped
his
head
and
made
no
reply
the
child
began
again
my
money
sir
jean
valjean
s
eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
earth
my
piece
of
money
cried
the
child
my
white
piece
my
silver
it
seemed
as
though
jean
valjean
did
not
hear
him
the
child
grasped
him
by
the
collar
of
his
blouse
and
shook
him
at
the
same
time
he
made
an
effort
to
displace
the
big
iron
shod
shoe
which
rested
on
his
treasure
i
want
my
piece
of
money
my
piece
of
forty
sous
the
child
wept
jean
valjean
raised
his
head
he
still
remained
seated
his
eyes
were
troubled
he
gazed
at
the
child
in
a
sort
of
amazement
then
he
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
his
cudgel
and
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
who
s
there
i
sir
replied
the
child
little
gervais
i
give
me
back
my
forty
sous
if
you
please
take
your
foot
away
sir
if
you
please
then
irritated
though
he
was
so
small
and
becoming
almost
menacing
come
now
will
you
take
your
foot
away
take
your
foot
away
or
we
ll
see
ah
it
s
still
you
said
jean
valjean
and
rising
abruptly
to
his
feet
his
foot
still
resting
on
the
silver
piece
he
added
will
you
take
yourself
off
the
frightened
child
looked
at
him
then
began
to
tremble
from
head
to
foot
and
after
a
few
moments
of
stupor
he
set
out
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
without
daring
to
turn
his
neck
or
to
utter
a
cry
nevertheless
lack
of
breath
forced
him
to
halt
after
a
certain
distance
and
jean
valjean
heard
him
sobbing
in
the
midst
of
his
own
revery
at
the
end
of
a
few
moments
the
child
had
disappeared
the
sun
had
set
the
shadows
were
descending
around
jean
valjean
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
it
is
probable
that
he
was
feverish
he
had
remained
standing
and
had
not
changed
his
attitude
after
the
child
s
flight
the
breath
heaved
his
chest
at
long
and
irregular
intervals
his
gaze
fixed
ten
or
twelve
paces
in
front
of
him
seemed
to
be
scrutinizing
with
profound
attention
the
shape
of
an
ancient
fragment
of
blue
earthenware
which
had
fallen
in
the
grass
all
at
once
he
shivered
he
had
just
begun
to
feel
the
chill
of
evening
he
settled
his
cap
more
firmly
on
his
brow
sought
mechanically
to
cross
and
button
his
blouse
advanced
a
step
and
stopped
to
pick
up
his
cudgel
at
that
moment
he
caught
sight
of
the
forty
sou
piece
which
his
foot
had
half
ground
into
the
earth
and
which
was
shining
among
the
pebbles
it
was
as
though
he
had
received
a
galvanic
shock
what
is
this
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
he
recoiled
three
paces
then
halted
without
being
able
to
detach
his
gaze
from
the
spot
which
his
foot
had
trodden
but
an
instant
before
as
though
the
thing
which
lay
glittering
there
in
the
gloom
had
been
an
open
eye
riveted
upon
him
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
moments
he
darted
convulsively
towards
the
silver
coin
seized
it
and
straightened
himself
up
again
and
began
to
gaze
afar
off
over
the
plain
at
the
same
time
casting
his
eyes
towards
all
points
of
the
horizon
as
he
stood
there
erect
and
shivering
like
a
terrified
wild
animal
which
is
seeking
refuge
he
saw
nothing
night
was
falling
the
plain
was
cold
and
vague
great
banks
of
violet
haze
were
rising
in
the
gleam
of
the
twilight
he
said
ah
and
set
out
rapidly
in
the
direction
in
which
the
child
had
disappeared
after
about
thirty
paces
he
paused
looked
about
him
and
saw
nothing
then
he
shouted
with
all
his
might
little
gervais
little
gervais
he
paused
and
waited
there
was
no
reply
the
landscape
was
gloomy
and
deserted
he
was
encompassed
by
space
there
was
nothing
around
him
but
an
obscurity
in
which
his
gaze
was
lost
and
a
silence
which
engulfed
his
voice
an
icy
north
wind
was
blowing
and
imparted
to
things
around
him
a
sort
of
lugubrious
life
the
bushes
shook
their
thin
little
arms
with
incredible
fury
one
would
have
said
that
they
were
threatening
and
pursuing
some
one
he
set
out
on
his
march
again
then
he
began
to
run
and
from
time
to
time
he
halted
and
shouted
into
that
solitude
with
a
voice
which
was
the
most
formidable
and
the
most
disconsolate
that
it
was
possible
to
hear
little
gervais
little
gervais
assuredly
if
the
child
had
heard
him
he
would
have
been
alarmed
and
would
have
taken
good
care
not
to
show
himself
but
the
child
was
no
doubt
already
far
away
he
encountered
a
priest
on
horseback
he
stepped
up
to
him
and
said
monsieur
le
cure
have
you
seen
a
child
pass
no
said
the
priest
one
named
little
gervais
i
have
seen
no
one
he
drew
two
five
franc
pieces
from
his
money
bag
and
handed
them
to
the
priest
monsieur
le
cure
this
is
for
your
poor
people
monsieur
le
cure
he
was
a
little
lad
about
ten
years
old
with
a
marmot
i
think
and
a
hurdy
gurdy
one
of
those
savoyards
you
know
i
have
not
seen
him
little
gervais
there
are
no
villages
here
can
you
tell
me
if
he
is
like
what
you
say
my
friend
he
is
a
little
stranger
such
persons
pass
through
these
parts
we
know
nothing
of
them
jean
valjean
seized
two
more
coins
of
five
francs
each
with
violence
and
gave
them
to
the
priest
for
your
poor
he
said
then
he
added
wildly
monsieur
l
abbe
have
me
arrested
i
am
a
thief
the
priest
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
fled
in
haste
much
alarmed
jean
valjean
set
out
on
a
run
in
the
direction
which
he
had
first
taken
in
this
way
he
traversed
a
tolerably
long
distance
gazing
calling
shouting
but
he
met
no
one
two
or
three
times
he
ran
across
the
plain
towards
something
which
conveyed
to
him
the
effect
of
a
human
being
reclining
or
crouching
down
it
turned
out
to
be
nothing
but
brushwood
or
rocks
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
earth
at
length
at
a
spot
where
three
paths
intersected
each
other
he
stopped
the
moon
had
risen
he
sent
his
gaze
into
the
distance
and
shouted
for
the
last
time
little
gervais
little
gervais
little
gervais
his
shout
died
away
in
the
mist
without
even
awakening
an
echo
he
murmured
yet
once
more
little
gervais
but
in
a
feeble
and
almost
inarticulate
voice
it
was
his
last
effort
his
legs
gave
way
abruptly
under
him
as
though
an
invisible
power
had
suddenly
overwhelmed
him
with
the
weight
of
his
evil
conscience
he
fell
exhausted
on
a
large
stone
his
fists
clenched
in
his
hair
and
his
face
on
his
knees
and
he
cried
i
am
a
wretch
then
his
heart
burst
and
he
began
to
cry
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
wept
in
nineteen
years
when
jean
valjean
left
the
bishop
s
house
he
was
as
we
have
seen
quite
thrown
out
of
everything
that
had
been
his
thought
hitherto
he
could
not
yield
to
the
evidence
of
what
was
going
on
within
him
he
hardened
himself
against
the
angelic
action
and
the
gentle
words
of
the
old
man
you
have
promised
me
to
become
an
honest
man
i
buy
your
soul
i
take
it
away
from
the
spirit
of
perversity
i
give
it
to
the
good
god
this
recurred
to
his
mind
unceasingly
to
this
celestial
kindness
he
opposed
pride
which
is
the
fortress
of
evil
within
us
he
was
indistinctly
conscious
that
the
pardon
of
this
priest
was
the
greatest
assault
and
the
most
formidable
attack
which
had
moved
him
yet
that
his
obduracy
was
finally
settled
if
he
resisted
this
clemency
that
if
he
yielded
he
should
be
obliged
to
renounce
that
hatred
with
which
the
actions
of
other
men
had
filled
his
soul
through
so
many
years
and
which
pleased
him
that
this
time
it
was
necessary
to
conquer
or
to
be
conquered
and
that
a
struggle
a
colossal
and
final
struggle
had
been
begun
between
his
viciousness
and
the
goodness
of
that
man
in
the
presence
of
these
lights
he
proceeded
like
a
man
who
is
intoxicated
as
he
walked
thus
with
haggard
eyes
did
he
have
a
distinct
perception
of
what
might
result
to
him
from
his
adventure
at
d
did
he
understand
all
those
mysterious
murmurs
which
warn
or
importune
the
spirit
at
certain
moments
of
life
did
a
voice
whisper
in
his
ear
that
he
had
just
passed
the
solemn
hour
of
his
destiny
that
there
no
longer
remained
a
middle
course
for
him
that
if
he
were
not
henceforth
the
best
of
men
he
would
be
the
worst
that
it
behooved
him
now
so
to
speak
to
mount
higher
than
the
bishop
or
fall
lower
than
the
convict
that
if
he
wished
to
become
good
be
must
become
an
angel
that
if
he
wished
to
remain
evil
he
must
become
a
monster
here
again
some
questions
must
be
put
which
we
have
already
put
to
ourselves
elsewhere
did
he
catch
some
shadow
of
all
this
in
his
thought
in
a
confused
way
misfortune
certainly
as
we
have
said
does
form
the
education
of
the
intelligence
nevertheless
it
is
doubtful
whether
jean
valjean
was
in
a
condition
to
disentangle
all
that
we
have
here
indicated
if
these
ideas
occurred
to
him
he
but
caught
glimpses
of
rather
than
saw
them
and
they
only
succeeded
in
throwing
him
into
an
unutterable
and
almost
painful
state
of
emotion
on
emerging
from
that
black
and
deformed
thing
which
is
called
the
galleys
the
bishop
had
hurt
his
soul
as
too
vivid
a
light
would
have
hurt
his
eyes
on
emerging
from
the
dark
the
future
life
the
possible
life
which
offered
itself
to
him
henceforth
all
pure
and
radiant
filled
him
with
tremors
and
anxiety
he
no
longer
knew
where
he
really
was
like
an
owl
who
should
suddenly
see
the
sun
rise
the
convict
had
been
dazzled
and
blinded
as
it
were
by
virtue
that
which
was
certain
that
which
he
did
not
doubt
was
that
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man
that
everything
about
him
was
changed
that
it
was
no
longer
in
his
power
to
make
it
as
though
the
bishop
had
not
spoken
to
him
and
had
not
touched
him
in
this
state
of
mind
he
had
encountered
little
gervais
and
had
robbed
him
of
his
forty
sous
why
he
certainly
could
not
have
explained
it
was
this
the
last
effect
and
the
supreme
effort
as
it
were
of
the
evil
thoughts
which
he
had
brought
away
from
the
galleys
a
remnant
of
impulse
a
result
of
what
is
called
in
statics
acquired
force
it
was
that
and
it
was
also
perhaps
even
less
than
that
let
us
say
it
simply
it
was
not
he
who
stole
it
was
not
the
man
it
was
the
beast
who
by
habit
and
instinct
had
simply
placed
his
foot
upon
that
money
while
the
intelligence
was
struggling
amid
so
many
novel
and
hitherto
unheard
of
thoughts
besetting
it
when
intelligence
re
awakened
and
beheld
that
action
of
the
brute
jean
valjean
recoiled
with
anguish
and
uttered
a
cry
of
terror

awakened
it
was
because
strange
phenomenon
and
one
which
was
possible
only
in
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
in
stealing
the
money
from
that
child
he
had
done
a
thing
of
which
he
was
no
longer
capable
however
that
may
be
this
last
evil
action
had
a
decisive
effect
on
him
it
abruptly
traversed
that
chaos
which
he
bore
in
his
mind
and
dispersed
it
placed
on
one
side
the
thick
obscurity
and
on
the
other
the
light
and
acted
on
his
soul
in
the
state
in
which
it
then
was
as
certain
chemical
reagents
act
upon
a
troubled
mixture
by
precipitating
one
element
and
clarifying
the
other
first
of
all
even
before
examining
himself
and
reflecting
all
bewildered
like
one
who
seeks
to
save
himself
he
tried
to
find
the
child
in
order
to
return
his
money
to
him
then
when
he
recognized
the
fact
that
this
was
impossible
he
halted
in
despair
at
the
moment
when
he
exclaimed
i
am
a
wretch
he
had
just
perceived
what
he
was
and
he
was
already
separated
from
himself
to
such
a
degree
that
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
phantom
and
as
if
he
had
there
before
him
in
flesh
and
blood
the
hideous
galley
convict
jean
valjean
cudgel
in
hand
his
blouse
on
his
hips
his
knapsack
filled
with
stolen
objects
on
his
back
with
his
resolute
and
gloomy
visage
with
his
thoughts
filled
with
abominable
projects
excess
of
unhappiness
had
as
we
have
remarked
made
him
in
some
sort
a
visionary
this
then
was
in
the
nature
of
a
vision
he
actually
saw
that
jean
valjean
that
sinister
face
before
him
he
had
almost
reached
the
point
of
asking
himself
who
that
man
was
and
he
was
horrified
by
him
his
brain
was
going
through
one
of
those
violent
and
yet
perfectly
calm
moments
in
which
revery
is
so
profound
that
it
absorbs
reality
one
no
longer
beholds
the
object
which
one
has
before
one
and
one
sees
as
though
apart
from
one
s
self
the
figures
which
one
has
in
one
s
own
mind
thus
he
contemplated
himself
so
to
speak
face
to
face
and
at
the
same
time
athwart
this
hallucination
he
perceived
in
a
mysterious
depth
a
sort
of
light
which
he
at
first
took
for
a
torch
on
scrutinizing
this
light
which
appeared
to
his
conscience
with
more
attention
he
recognized
the
fact
that
it
possessed
a
human
form
and
that
this
torch
was
the
bishop
his
conscience
weighed
in
turn
these
two
men
thus
placed
before
it
the
bishop
and
jean
valjean
nothing
less
than
the
first
was
required
to
soften
the
second
by
one
of
those
singular
effects
which
are
peculiar
to
this
sort
of
ecstasies
in
proportion
as
his
revery
continued
as
the
bishop
grew
great
and
resplendent
in
his
eyes
so
did
jean
valjean
grow
less
and
vanish
after
a
certain
time
he
was
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
shade
all
at
once
he
disappeared
the
bishop
alone
remained
he
filled
the
whole
soul
of
this
wretched
man
with
a
magnificent
radiance
jean
valjean
wept
for
a
long
time
he
wept
burning
tears
he
sobbed
with
more
weakness
than
a
woman
with
more
fright
than
a
child
as
he
wept
daylight
penetrated
more
and
more
clearly
into
his
soul
an
extraordinary
light
a
light
at
once
ravishing
and
terrible
his
past
life
his
first
fault
his
long
expiation
his
external
brutishness
his
internal
hardness
his
dismissal
to
liberty
rejoicing
in
manifold
plans
of
vengeance
what
had
happened
to
him
at
the
bishop
s
the
last
thing
that
he
had
done
that
theft
of
forty
sous
from
a
child
a
crime
all
the
more
cowardly
and
all
the
more
monstrous
since
it
had
come
after
the
bishop
s
pardon
all
this
recurred
to
his
mind
and
appeared
clearly
to
him
but
with
a
clearness
which
he
had
never
hitherto
witnessed
he
examined
his
life
and
it
seemed
horrible
to
him
his
soul
and
it
seemed
frightful
to
him
in
the
meantime
a
gentle
light
rested
over
this
life
and
this
soul
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
beheld
satan
by
the
light
of
paradise
how
many
hours
did
he
weep
thus
what
did
he
do
after
he
had
wept
whither
did
he
go
no
one
ever
knew
the
only
thing
which
seems
to
be
authenticated
is
that
that
same
night
the
carrier
who
served
grenoble
at
that
epoch
and
who
arrived
at
d
about
three
o
clock
in

saw
as

still
a
little
like
working

and
not

entirely
divorced
from
their
needles
somewhat
disturbed
by
intrigues
but
still
retaining
on
their
faces
something
of
the
serenity
of
toil
and
in
their
souls
that
flower
of
honesty
which
survives
the

in

hardly
begun

who

on

which
they
accomplish
and

which
are
thrown
at

are
overwhelmed
with

of
all
that
is
immaculate
and
inaccessible

what

were
hungry
favourite
having
been
in
england
was
admired
by
dahlia
and
zephine
she
had
had
an
establishment
of
her
own
very
early
in
life
her
father
was
an
old
unmarried
professor
of
mathematics
a
brutal
man
and
a
braggart
who
went
out
to
give
lessons
in
spite
of
his
age
this
professor
when
he
was
a
young
man
had
one
day
seen
a
chambermaid
s
gown
catch
on
a
fender
he
had
fallen
in
love
in
consequence
of
this
accident
the
result
had
been
favourite
she
met
her
father
from
time
to
time
and
he
bowed
to
her
one
morning
an
old
woman
with
the
air
of
a
devotee
had
entered
her
apartments
and
had
said
to
her
you
do
not
know
me
mamemoiselle
no
i
am
your
mother
then
the
old
woman
opened
the
sideboard
and
ate
and
drank
had
a
mattress
which
she
owned
brought
in
and
installed
herself
this
cross
and
pious
old
mother
never
spoke
to
favourite
remained
hours
without
uttering
a
word
breakfasted
dined
and
supped
for
four
and
went
down
to
the
porter
s
quarters
for
company
where
she
spoke
ill
of
her
daughter
it
was
having
rosy
nails
that
were
too
pretty
which
had
drawn
dahlia
to
listolier
to
others
perhaps
to
idleness
how
could
she
make
such
nails
work
she
who
wishes
to
remain
virtuous
must
not
have
pity
on
her
hands
as
for
zephine
she
had
conquered
fameuil
by
her
roguish
and
caressing
little
way
of
saying
yes
sir
the
young
men
were
comrades
the
young
girls
were
friends
such
loves
are
always
accompanied
by
such
friendships
goodness
and
philosophy
are
two
distinct
things
the
proof
of
this
is
that
after
making
all
due
allowances
for
these
little
irregular
households
favourite
zephine
and
dahlia
were
philosophical
young
women
while
fantine
was
a
good
girl
good
some
one
will
exclaim
and
tholomyes
solomon
would
reply
that
love
forms
a
part
of
wisdom
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
saying
that
the
love
of
fantine
was
a
first
love
a
sole
love
a
faithful
love
she
alone
of
all
the
four
was
not
called
thou
by
a
single
one
of
them
fantine
was
one
of
those
beings
who
blossom
so
to
speak
from
the
dregs
of
the
people
though
she
had
emerged
from
the
most
unfathomable
depths
of
social
shadow
she
bore
on
her
brow
the
sign
of
the
anonymous
and
the
unknown
she
was
born
at
m
sur
m
of
what
parents
who
can
say
she
had
never
known
father
or
mother
she
was
called
fantine
why
fantine
she
had
never
borne
any
other
name
at
the
epoch
of
her
birth
the
directory
still
existed
she
had
no
family
name
she
had
no
family
no
baptismal
name
the
church
no
longer
existed
she
bore
the
name
which
pleased
the
first
random
passer
by
who
had
encountered
her
when
a
very
small
child
running
bare
legged
in
the
street
she
received
the
name
as
she
received
the
water
from
the
clouds
upon
her
brow
when
it
rained
she
was
called
little
fantine
no
one
knew
more
than
that
this
human
creature
had
entered
life
in
just
this
way
at
the
age
of
ten
fantine
quitted
the
town
and
went
to
service
with
some
farmers
in
the
neighborhood
at
fifteen
she
came
to
paris
to
seek
her
fortune
fantine
was
beautiful
and
remained
pure
as
long
as
she
could
she
was
a
lovely
blonde
with
fine
teeth
she
had
gold
and
pearls
for
her
dowry
but
her
gold
was
on
her
head
and
her
pearls
were
in
her
mouth
she
worked
for
her
living
then
still
for
the
sake
of
her
living
for
the
heart
also
has
its
hunger
she
loved
she
loved
tholomyes
an
amour
for
him
passion
for
her
the
streets
of
the
latin
quarter
filled
with
throngs
of
students
and
grisettes
saw
the
beginning
of
their
dream
fantine
had
long
evaded
tholomyes
in
the
mazes
of
the
hill
of
the
pantheon
where
so
many
adventurers
twine
and
untwine
but
in
such
a
way
as
constantly
to
encounter
him
again
there
is
a
way
of
avoiding
which
resembles
seeking
in
short
the
eclogue
took
place
blachevelle
listolier
and
fameuil
formed
a
sort
of
group
of
which
tholomyes
was
the
head
it
was
he
who
possessed
the
wit
tholomyes
was
the
antique
old
student
he
was
rich
he
had
an
income
of
four
thousand
francs
four
thousand
francs
a
splendid
scandal
on
mount
sainte
genevieve
tholomyes
was
a
fast
man
of
thirty
and
badly
preserved
he
was
wrinkled
and
toothless
and
he
had
the
beginning
of
a
bald
spot
of
which
he
himself
said
with
sadness
the
skull
at
thirty
the
knee
at
forty
his
digestion
was
mediocre
and
he
had
been
attacked
by
a
watering
in
one
eye
but
in
proportion
as
his
youth
disappeared
gayety
was
kindled
he
replaced
his
teeth
with
buffooneries
his
hair
with
mirth
his
health
with
irony
his
weeping
eye
laughed
incessantly
he
was
dilapidated
but
still
in
flower
his
youth
which
was
packing
up
for
departure
long
before
its
time
beat
a
retreat
in
good
order
bursting
with
laughter
and
no
one
saw
anything
but
fire
he
had
had
a
piece
rejected
at
the
vaudeville
he
made
a
few
verses
now
and
then
in
addition
to
this
he
doubted
everything
to
the
last
degree
which
is
a
vast
force
in
the
eyes
of
the
weak
being
thus
ironical
and
bald
he
was
the
leader
iron
is
an
english
word
is
it
possible
that
irony
is
derived
from
it
one
day
tholomyes
took
the
three
others
aside
with
the
gesture
of
an
oracle
and
said
to
them
fantine
dahlia
zephine
and
favourite
have
been
teasing
us
for
nearly
a
year
to
give
them
a
surprise
we
have
promised
them
solemnly
that
we
would
they
are
forever
talking
about
it
to
us
to
me
in
particular
just
as
the
old
women
in
naples
cry
to
saint
januarius
faccia
gialluta
fa
o
miracolo
yellow
face
perform
thy
miracle
so
our
beauties
say
to
me
incessantly
tholomyes
when
will
you
bring
forth
your
surprise
at
the
same
time
our
parents
keep
writing
to
us
pressure
on
both
sides
the
moment
has
arrived
it
seems
to
me
let
us
discuss
the
question
thereupon
tholomyes
lowered
his
voice
and
articulated
something
so
mirthful
that
a
vast
and
enthusiastic
grin
broke
out
upon
the
four
mouths
simultaneously
and
blachevelle
exclaimed
that
is
an
idea
a
smoky
tap
room
presented
itself
they
entered
and
the
remainder
of
their
confidential
colloquy
was
lost
in
shadow
the
result
of
these
shades
was
a
dazzling
pleasure
party
which
took
place
on
the
following
sunday
the
four
young
men
inviting
the
four
young

and

it
is
hard
nowadays
to
picture
to
one
s
self
what
a
pleasure
trip
of
students
and
grisettes
to
the
country
was
like
forty
five
years
ago
the
suburbs
of
paris
are
no
longer
the
same
the
physiognomy
of
what
may
be
called
circumparisian
life
has
changed
completely
in
the
last
half
century
where
there
was
the
cuckoo
there
is
the
railway
car
where
there
was
a
tender
boat
there
is
now
the
steamboat
people
speak
of
fecamp
nowadays
as
they
spoke
of
saint
cloud
in
those
days
the
paris
of
1862
is
a
city
which
has
france
for
its
outskirts
the
four
couples
conscientiously
went
through
with
all
the
country
follies
possible
at
that
time
the
vacation
was
beginning
and
it
was
a
warm
bright
summer
day
on
the
preceding
day
favourite
the
only
one
who
knew
how
to
write
had
written
the
following
to
tholomyes
in
the
name
of
the
four
it
is
a
good
hour
to
emerge
from
happiness
that
is
why
they
rose
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
then
they
went
to
saint
cloud
by
the
coach
looked
at
the
dry
cascade
and
exclaimed
this
must
be
very
beautiful
when
there
is
water
they
breakfasted
at
the
tete
noir
where
castaing
had
not
yet
been
they
treated
themselves
to
a
game
of
ring
throwing
under
the
quincunx
of
trees
of
the
grand
fountain
they
ascended
diogenes
lantern
they
gambled
for
macaroons
at
the
roulette
establishment
of
the
pont
de
sevres
picked
bouquets
at
pateaux
bought
reed
pipes
at
neuilly
ate
apple
tarts
everywhere
and
were
perfectly
happy
the
young
girls
rustled
and
chatted
like
warblers
escaped
from
their
cage
it
was
a
perfect
delirium
from
time
to
time
they
bestowed
little
taps
on
the
young
men
matutinal
intoxication
of
life
adorable
years
the
wings
of
the
dragonfly
quiver
oh
whoever
you
may
be
do
you
not
remember
have
you
rambled
through
the
brushwood
holding
aside
the
branches
on
account
of
the
charming
head
which
is
coming
on
behind
you
have
you
slid
laughing
down
a
slope
all
wet
with
rain
with
a
beloved
woman
holding
your
hand
and
crying
ah
my
new
boots
what
a
state
they
are
in
let
us
say
at
once
that
that
merry
obstacle
a
shower
was
lacking
in
the
case
of
this
good
humored
party
although
favourite
had
said
as
they
set
out
with
a
magisterial
and
maternal
tone
the
slugs
are
crawling
in
the
paths
a

of

children
all
four
were
madly
pretty
a
good
old
classic
poet
then
famous

good
fellow
who
had
an
eleonore

chevalier
de
labouisse
as
he
strolled
that
day
beneath
the
chestnut
trees
of
saint
cloud
saw
them
pass
about
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
exclaimed
there
is
one
too
many
of
them
as
he
thought
of
the
graces
favourite
blachevelle
s
friend
the
one
aged
three
and
twenty
the
old
one
ran
on
in
front
under
the
great
green
boughs
jumped
the
ditches
stalked
distractedly
over
bushes
and
presided
over
this
merry
making
with
the
spirit
of
a
young
female
faun
zephine
and
dahlia
whom
chance
had
made
beautiful
in
such
a
way
that
they
set
each
off
when
they
were
together
and
completed
each
other
never
left
each
other
more
from
an
instinct
of
coquetry
than
from
friendship
and
clinging
to
each
other
they
assumed
english
poses
the
first
keepsakes
had
just
made
their
appearance
melancholy
was
dawning
for
women
as
later
on
byronism
dawned
for
men
and
the
hair
of
the
tender
sex
began
to
droop
dolefully
zephine
and
dahlia
had
their
hair
dressed
in
rolls
listolier
and
fameuil
who
were
engaged
in
discussing
their
professors
explained
to
fantine
the
difference
that
existed
between
m
delvincourt
and
m
blondeau
blachevelle
seemed
to
have
been
created
expressly
to
carry
favourite
s
single
bordered
imitation
india
shawl
of
ternaux
s
manufacture
on
his
arm
on
sundays
tholomyes
followed
dominating
the
group
he
was
very
gay
but
one
felt
the
force
of
government
in
him
there
was
dictation
in
his
joviality
his
principal
ornament
was
a
pair
of
trousers
of
elephant
leg
pattern
of
nankeen
with
straps
of
braided
copper
wire
he
carried
a
stout
rattan
worth
two
hundred
francs
in
his
hand
and
as
he
treated
himself
to
everything
a
strange
thing
called
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
nothing
was
sacred
to
him
he
smoked
that
tholomyes
is
astounding
said
the
others
with
veneration
what
trousers
what
energy
as
for
fantine
she
was
a
joy
to
behold
her
splendid
teeth
had
evidently
received
an
office
from
god
laughter
she
preferred
to
carry
her
little
hat
of
sewed
straw
with
its
long
white
strings
in
her
hand
rather
than
on
her
head
her
thick
blond
hair
which
was
inclined
to
wave
and
which
easily
uncoiled
and
which
it
was
necessary
to
fasten
up
incessantly
seemed
made
for
the
flight
of
galatea
under
the
willows
her
rosy
lips
babbled
enchantingly
the
corners
of
her
mouth
voluptuously
turned
up
as
in
the
antique
masks
of
erigone
had
an
air
of
encouraging
the
audacious
but
her
long
shadowy
lashes
drooped
discreetly
over
the
jollity
of
the
lower
part
of
the
face
as
though
to
call
a
halt
there
was
something
indescribably
harmonious
and
striking
about
her
entire
dress
she
wore
a
gown
of
mauve
barege
little
reddish
brown
buskins
whose
ribbons
traced
an
x
on
her
fine
white
open
worked
stockings
and
that
sort
of
muslin
spencer
a
marseilles
invention
whose
name
canezou
a
corruption
of
the
words
quinze
aout
pronounced
after
the
fashion
of
the
canebiere
signifies
fine
weather
heat
and
midday
the
three
others
less
timid
as
we
have
already
said
wore
low
necked
dresses
without
disguise
which
in
summer
beneath
flower
adorned
hats
are
very
graceful
and
enticing
but
by
the
side
of
these
audacious
outfits
blond
fantine
s
canezou
with
its
transparencies
its
indiscretion
and
its
reticence
concealing
and
displaying
at
one
and
the
same
time
seemed
an
alluring
godsend
of
decency
and
the
famous
court
of
love
presided
over
by
the
vicomtesse
de
cette
with
the
sea
green
eyes
would
perhaps
have
awarded
the
prize
for
coquetry
to
this
canezou
in
the
contest
for
the
prize
of
modesty
the
most
ingenious
is
at
times
the
wisest
this
does
happen
brilliant
of
face
delicate
of
profile
with
eyes
of
a
deep
blue
heavy
lids
feet
arched
and
small
wrists
and
ankles
admirably
formed
a
white
skin
which
here
and
there
allowed
the
azure
branching
of
the
veins
to
be
seen
joy
a
cheek
that
was
young
and
fresh
the
robust
throat
of
the
juno
of
aegina
a
strong
and
supple
nape
of
the
neck
shoulders
modelled
as
though
by
coustou
with
a
voluptuous
dimple
in
the
middle
visible
through
the
muslin
a
gayety
cooled
by
dreaminess
sculptural
and
exquisite
such
was
fantine
and
beneath
these
feminine
adornments
and
these
ribbons
one
could
divine
a
statue
and
in
that
statue
a
soul
fantine
was
beautiful
without
being
too
conscious
of
it
those
rare
dreamers
mysterious
priests
of
the
beautiful
who
silently
confront
everything
with
perfection
would
have
caught
a
glimpse
in
this
little
working
woman
through
the
transparency
of
her
parisian
grace
of
the
ancient
sacred
euphony
this
daughter
of
the
shadows
was
thoroughbred
she
was
beautiful
in
the
two
ways
style
and
rhythm
style
is
the
form
of
the
ideal
rhythm
is
its
movement
we
have
said
that
fantine
was
joy
she
was
also
modesty
to
an
observer
who
studied
her
attentively
that
which
breathed
from
her
athwart
all
the
intoxication
of
her
age
the
season
and
her
love
affair
was
an
invincible
expression
of
reserve
and
modesty
she
remained
a
little
astonished
this
chaste
astonishment
is
the
shade
of
difference
which
separates
psyche
from
venus
fantine
had
the
long
white
fine
fingers
of
the
vestal
virgin
who
stirs
the
ashes
of
the
sacred
fire
with
a
golden
pin
although
she
would
have
refused
nothing
to
tholomyes
as
we
shall
have
more
than
ample
opportunity
to
see
her
face
in
repose
was
supremely
virginal
a
sort
of
serious
and
almost
austere
dignity
suddenly
overwhelmed
her
at
certain
times
and
there
was
nothing
more
singular
and
disturbing
than
to
see
gayety
become
so
suddenly
extinct
there
and
meditation
succeed
to
cheerfulness
without
any
transition
state
this
sudden
and
sometimes
severely
accentuated
gravity
resembled
the
disdain
of
a
goddess
her
brow
her
nose
her
chin
presented
that
equilibrium
of
outline
which
is
quite
distinct
from
equilibrium
of
proportion
and
from
which
harmony
of
countenance
results
in
the
very
characteristic
interval
which
separates
the
base
of
the
nose
from
the
upper
lip
she
had
that
imperceptible
and
charming
fold
a
mysterious
sign
of
chastity
which
makes
barberousse
fall
in
love
with
a
diana
found
in
the
treasures
of
iconia
love
is
a
fault
so
be
it
fantine
was
innocence
floating
high
over

chapter

is
so
merry
that
he
sings
a
spanish
ditty
that
day
was
composed
of

swooped
down
upon
the

the

and
the
sterile
oats
in
the
august
park
of

there
was
a

of

the

the

received
to
some
extent
the
kisses
of
all
with
the
exception
of
fantine
who
was
hedged
about
with
that
vague
resistance
of
hers
composed
of
dreaminess
and
wildness
and
who
was
in
love
you
always
have
a
queer
look
about
you
said
favourite
to
her
such
things
are
joys
these
passages
of
happy
couples
are
a
profound
appeal
to
life
and
nature
and
make
a
caress
and
light
spring
forth
from
everything
there
was
once
a
fairy
who
created
the
fields
and
forests
expressly
for
those
in
love
in
that
eternal
hedge
school
of
lovers
which
is
forever
beginning
anew
and
which
will
last
as
long
as
there
are

and

popularity
of

the
courtiers
and

as
they
used
to
say
in
olden
times
all
are
subjects
of
this
fairy
they
laugh
and
hunt
and
there
is
in
the
air
the
brilliance
of
an
apotheosis
what
a
transfiguration
effected
by
love
notaries

the

went
to
what
was

called
the

to
see
a
newly
arrived
plant
from
india
whose
name
escapes
our
memory
at
this
moment
and
which
at
that
epoch
was
attracting
all
paris
to
saint
cloud
it
was
an
odd
and
charming
shrub
with
a
long
stem
whose
numerous
branches
bristling
and
leafless
and
as
fine
as
threads
were
covered
with
a
million
tiny
white
rosettes
this
gave
the
shrub
the
air
of
a
head
of
hair
studded
with
flowers
there
was
always
an
admiring
crowd
about
it
after
viewing
the
shrub
tholomyes
exclaimed
i
offer
you
asses
and
having
agreed
upon
a
price
with
the
owner
of
the
asses
they
returned
by

the

in

tried
the
mysterious
little
effects
of
the
famous

the
wanton

worthy

a

or
of

metamorphosed
into

they
had
stoutly
shaken
the
swing
attached
to
the
two
chestnut
trees
celebrated
by
the
abbe
de
bernis
as
he
swung
these
beauties
one
after

producing
folds
in
the
fluttering
skirts
which

have
found

the

was
somewhat
of

being
the

to
a
melancholy
chant
the
old

probably
inspired
by
some
lovely

dashing
in

flight
upon

favourite
with

of
acrimony
after
leaving
the

there
was
a
fresh
delight
they
crossed
the

in
a

and
proceeding
from

on

they
reached

about

the
four
couples
frightened
at

happiness
were
sliding
down
the
russian

a
singular
edifice
which
then
occupied
the

the

having

they
began
to
think
about

and
the
radiant
party
of
eight
somewhat
weary
at
last
became
stranded
in
bombarda

public
house
a
branch
establishment
which
had
been
set
up
in

by
that
famous

be
seen
in

a
large

ugly

with
an
alcove
and
a

at

they
had
been
obliged
to
put
up
with

in

two

lightly
touching

with
flasks
of

very
little
order
on
the

some
disorder
beneath
it
they
made
beneath
the
table
a
noise
a
clatter
of
the
feet
that
was
abominable
says
moliere
this
was
the
state
which
the

begun
at
five
o

in

had
reached
at

four

were
satisfied
the
champs

filled
with
sunshine

with

were
nothing
but
light
and
dust
the
two
things
of
which
glory
is
composed
the
horses

those
neighing

were
prancing
in
a
cloud
of

carriages

coming

the

and
there
choruses
of
little

threw
to
the
winds
amid
the
passersby
who
formed
into
circles
and
applauded
the
then
celebrated
bourbon
air
which
was
destined
to
strike
the

sometimes
even
decorated
with

scattered
over

others
were

some

their
laughter
was
audible
every
thing
was
radiant
it
was
a
time
of
undisputed
peace
and
profound
royalist
security
it
was
the
epoch
when
a
special
and
private
report
of
chief
of
police
angeles
to
the
king
on
the
subject
of
the
suburbs
of
paris
terminated
with
these
lines
taking
all
things
into
consideration
sire
there
is
nothing
to
be
feared
from
these
people
they
are
as
heedless
and
as
indolent
as
cats
the
populace
is
restless
in
the
provinces
it
is
not
in
paris
these
are
very
pretty
men
sire
it
would
take
all
of
two
of
them
to
make
one
of
your
grenadiers
there
is
nothing
to
be
feared
on
the
part
of
the
populace
of
paris
the
capital
it
is
remarkable
that
the
stature
of
this
population
should
have
diminished
in
the
last
fifty
years
and
the
populace
of
the
suburbs
is
still
more
puny
than
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
it
is
not
dangerous
in
short
it
is
an
amiable
rabble
prefects
of
the
police
do
not
deem
it
possible
that
a
cat
can
transform
itself
into
a
lion
that
does
happen
however
and
in
that
lies
the
miracle
wrought
by
the
populace
of
paris
moreover
the
cat
so
despised
by
count
angles
possessed
the
esteem
of
the
republics
of
old
in
their
eyes
it
was
liberty
incarnate
and
as
though
to
serve
as
pendant
to
the
minerva
aptera
of
the
piraeus
there
stood
on
the
public
square
in
corinth
the
colossal
bronze
figure
of
a
cat
the
ingenuous
police
of
the
restoration
beheld
the
populace
of
paris
in
too
rose
colored
a
light
it
is
not
so
much
of
an
amiable
rabble
as
it
is
thought
the
parisian
is
to
the
frenchman
what
the
athenian
was
to
the
greek
no
one
sleeps
more
soundly
than
he
no
one
is
more
frankly
frivolous
and
lazy
than
he
no
one
can
better
assume
the
air
of
forgetfulness
let
him
not
be
trusted
nevertheless
he
is
ready
for
any
sort
of
cool
deed
but
when
there
is
glory
at
the
end
of
it
he
is
worthy
of
admiration
in
every
sort
of
fury
give
him
a
pike
he
will
produce
the
10th
of
august
give
him
a
gun
you
will
have
austerlitz
he
is
napoleon
s
stay
and
danton
s
resource
is
it
a
question
of
country
he
enlists
is
it
a
question
of
liberty
he
tears
up
the
pavements
beware
his
hair
filled
with
wrath
is
epic
his
blouse
drapes
itself
like
the
folds
of
a
chlamys
take
care
he
will
make
of
the
first
rue
grenetat
which
comes
to
hand
caudine
forks
when
the
hour
strikes
this
man
of
the
faubourgs
will
grow
in
stature
this
little
man
will
arise
and
his
gaze
will
be
terrible
and
his
breath
will
become
a
tempest
and
there
will
issue
forth
from
that
slender
chest
enough
wind
to
disarrange
the
folds
of
the
alps
it
is
thanks
to
the
suburban
man
of
paris
that
the
revolution
mixed
with
arms
conquers
europe
he
sings
it
is
his
delight
proportion
his
song
to
his
nature
and
you
will
see
as
long
as
he
has
for
refrain
nothing
but
la
carmagnole
he
only
overthrows
louis
xvi
make
him
sing
the
marseillaise
and
he
will
free
the
world

we
will
return
to
our
four
couples
the
dinner
as
we
have
said
was
drawing
to
its
close
chapter

a
chapter
in
which
they
adore
each
other
chat
at

the
chat
of
love
it
is
as
impossible
to
reproduce
one
as
the
other
the
chat

favourite
gazed
tenderly
at
blachevelle
and
said
blachevelle
i
adore
you
this
called
forth
a
question
from
blachevelle
what
would
you
do
favourite
if
i
were
to
cease
to
love
you
i
cried
favourite
ah
do
not
say
that
even
in
jest
if
you
were
to
cease
to
love
me
i
would
spring
after
you
i
would
scratch
you
i
should
rend
you
i
would
throw
you
into
the
water
i
would
have
you
arrested
blachevelle
smiled
with
the
voluptuous
self
conceit
of
a
man
who
is
tickled
in
his
self
love
favourite
resumed
yes
i
would
scream
to
the
police
ah
i
should
not
restrain
myself
not
at
all
rabble
blachevelle
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
in
an
ecstasy
and
closed
both
eyes
proudly
dahlia
as
she
ate
said
in
a
low
voice
to
favourite
amid
the
uproar
so
you
really
idolize
him
deeply
that
blachevelle
of
yours
i
i
detest
him
replied
favourite
in
the
same
tone
seizing
her
fork
again
he
is
avaricious
i
love
the
little
fellow
opposite
me
in
my
house
he
is
very
nice
that
young
man
do
you
know
him
one
can
see
that
he
is
an
actor
by
profession
i
love
actors
as
soon
as
he
comes
in
his
mother
says
to
him
ah
mon
dieu
my
peace
of
mind
is
gone
there
he
goes
with
his
shouting
but
my
dear
you
are
splitting
my
head
so
he
goes
up
to
rat
ridden
garrets
to
black
holes
as
high
as
he
can
mount
and
there
he
sets
to
singing
declaiming
how
do
i
know
what
so
that
he
can
be
heard
down
stairs
he
earns
twenty
sous
a
day
at
an
attorney
s
by
penning
quibbles
he
is
the
son
of
a
former
precentor
of
saint
jacques
du
haut
pas
ah
he
is
very
nice
he
idolizes
me
so
that
one
day
when
he
saw
me
making
batter
for
some
pancakes
he
said
to
me
mamselle
make
your
gloves
into
fritters
and
i
will
eat
them
it
is
only
artists
who
can
say
such
things
as
that
ah
he
is
very
nice
i
am
in
a
fair
way
to
go
out
of
my
head
over
that
little
fellow
never
mind
i
tell
blachevelle
that
i
adore
him
how
i
lie
hey
how
i
do

paused
and
then
went
on
i
am
sad
you
see
dahlia
it
has
done
nothing
but
rain
all
summer
the
wind
irritates
me
the
wind
does
not
abate
blachevelle
is
very
stingy
there
are
hardly
any
green
peas
in
the
market
one
does
not
know
what
to
eat
i
have
the
spleen
as
the
english
say
butter
is
so
dear
and
then
you
see
it
is
horrible
here
we
are
dining
in
a

with
a

in

that
disgusts

to

and
remember
this
each
one
of
our
passions
even
love
has
a
stomach
which
must
not
be
filled
too
full
in
all
things
the
word
finis
must
be
written
in
good
season
self
control
must
be
exercised
when
the
matter
becomes
urgent
the
bolt
must
be
drawn
on
appetite
one
must
set
one
s
own
fantasy
to
the
violin
and
carry
one
s
self
to
the

the

is
the
man
who
knows
how
at
a

moment
to
effect
his

arrest
have
some
confidence
in
me
for
i
have
succeeded
to
some
extent
in
my
study
of
the
law
according
to
the
verdict
of
my
examinations
for
i
know
the
difference
between
the
question
put
and
the
question
pending
for
i
have
sustained
a
thesis
in
latin
upon
the
manner
in
which
torture
was
administered
at
rome
at
the
epoch
when
munatius
demens
was
quaestor
of
the
parricide
because
i
am
going
to
be
a
doctor
apparently
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
be
an
imbecile
i
recommend
you
to
moderation
in
your
desires
it
is
true
that
my

is

when

ladies
take
the
advice
of
a
friend
make
a
mistake
in
your
neighbor
if
you
see
fit
the
property
of
love
is
to
err
a
love
affair
is
not
made
to
crouch
down
and
brutalize
itself
like
an
english
serving
maid
who
has
callouses
on
her
knees
from
scrubbing
it
is
not
made
for
that
it
errs
gayly
our
gentle
love
it
has
been
said
error
is
human
i
say
error
is
love
ladies
i
idolize
you
all
o
zephine
o
josephine
face
more
than
irregular
you
would
be
charming
were
you
not
all
askew
you
have
the
air
of
a
pretty
face
upon
which
some
one
has
sat
down
by
mistake
as
for
favourite
o
nymphs
and
muses
one
day
when
blachevelle
was
crossing
the
gutter
in
the
rue
guerin
boisseau
he
espied
a
beautiful
girl
with
white
stockings
well
drawn
up
which
displayed
her
legs
this
prologue
pleased
him
and
blachevelle
fell
in
love
the
one
he
loved
was
favourite
o
favourite
thou
hast
ionian

there
was
a
greek
painter
named
euphorion
who
was
surnamed
the
painter
of
the
lips
that
greek
alone
would
have
been
worthy
to
paint
thy
mouth
listen
before
thee
there
was
never
a
creature
worthy
of
the
name
thou
wert
made
to
receive
the
apple
like
venus
or
to
eat
it
like
eve
beauty
begins
with
thee
i
have
just
referred
to
eve
it
is
thou
who
hast
created
her
thou
deservest
the
letters
patent
of
the
beautiful
woman
o
favourite
i
cease
to
address
you
as
thou
because
i
pass
from
poetry
to
prose
you
were
speaking
of
my
name
a
little
while
ago
that
touched
me
but
let
us
whoever
we
may
be
distrust
names
they
may
delude
us
i
am
called
felix
and
i
am
not
happy
words
are
liars
let
us
not
blindly
accept
the
indications
which
they
afford
us
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
write
to
liege

for
corks
and
to
pau
for

miss
dahlia
were
i
in
your
place
i
would
call
myself
rosa
a
flower
should
smell
sweet
and
woman
should
have
wit
i
say
nothing
of
fantine
she
is
a
dreamer
a
musing
thoughtful
pensive
person
she
is
a
phantom
possessed
of
the
form
of
a
nymph
and
the
modesty
of
a
nun
who
has
strayed
into
the
life
of
a
grisette
but
who
takes
refuge
in
illusions
and
who
sings
and
prays
and
gazes
into
the
azure
without
very
well
knowing
what
she
sees
or
what
she
is
doing
and
who
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
heaven
wanders
in
a
garden
where
there
are
more
birds
than
are
in
existence
o
fantine
know
this
i
tholomyes
i
am
all
illusion
but
she
does
not
even
hear
me
that
blond
maid
of
chimeras
as
for
the
rest
everything
about
her
is
freshness
suavity
youth
sweet
morning

o
fantine
maid
worthy
of
being
called
marguerite
or
pearl
you
are
a
woman
from
the
beauteous
orient
ladies
a
second
piece
of
advice
do
not
marry
marriage
is
a
graft
it
takes
well
or
ill
avoid
that
risk
but
bah
what
am
i
saying
i
am
wasting
my
words
girls
are
incurable
on
the
subject
of
marriage
and
all
that
we
wise
men
can
say
will
not
prevent
the
waistcoat
makers
and
the
shoe
stitchers
from
dreaming
of
husbands
studded
with
diamonds
well
so
be
it
but
my
beauties
remember
this
you
eat
too
much
sugar
you
have
but
one
fault
o
woman
and
that
is
nibbling
sugar
o
nibbling
sex
your
pretty
little
white
teeth
adore
sugar
now
heed
me
well
sugar
is
a
salt
all
salts
are
withering
sugar
is
the
most
desiccating
of
all
salts
it
sucks
the
liquids
of
the
blood
through
the
veins
hence
the
coagulation
and
then
the
solidification
of
the
blood
hence
tubercles
in
the
lungs
hence
death
that
is
why
diabetes
borders
on
consumption
then
do
not
crunch
sugar
and
you
will
live
i
turn
to
the
men

conquest
rob
each
other

leaned
two
by

on
the

sills
chatting
craning
out
their

talking
from

of

could
see
through

diverted

all

followed

went
through

some
huge
vehicle
painted
yellow
and
black
heavily
loaded
noisily
harnessed
rendered
shapeless
by
trunks
tarpaulins
and
valises
full
of
heads
which
immediately
disappeared
rushed
through
the
crowd
with
all
the
sparks
of
a

of

this
uproar
delighted
the
young
girls
favourite
exclaimed
what
a
row
one
would
say
that
it
was
a
pile
of
chains
flying
away
it
chanced
that
one
of
these
vehicles
which
they
could
only
see
with
difficulty
through
the
thick
elms
halted
for
a
moment
then
set
out
again
at
a
gallop
this
surprised
fantine
that
s
odd
said
she
i
thought
the
diligence
never
stopped
favourite
shrugged
her
shoulders
this
fantine
is
surprising
i
am
coming
to
take
a
look
at
her
out
of
curiosity
she
is
dazzled
by
the
simplest
things
suppose
a
case
i
am
a
traveller
i
say
to
the
diligence
i
will
go
on
in
advance
you
shall
pick
me
up
on
the
quay
as
you
pass
the
diligence
passes
sees
me
halts
and
takes
me
that
is
done
every
day
you
do
not
know
life
my
dear
in
this
manner
a
certain
time
elapsed
all
at
once
favourite
made
a
movement
like
a
person
who
is
just
waking
up
well
said
she
and
the
surprise
yes
by
the
way
joined
in
dahlia
the
famous
surprise
they
are
a
very
long
time
about
it
said
fantine
as
fantine
concluded
this
sigh
the
waiter
who
had
served
them
at
dinner
entered
he
held
in
his
hand
something
which
resembled
a
letter
what
is
that
demanded
favourite
the
waiter
replied
it
is
a
paper
that
those
gentlemen
left
for
these
ladies
why
did
you
not
bring
it
at
once
because
said
the
waiter
the
gentlemen
ordered
me
not
to
deliver
it
to
the
ladies
for
an
hour
favourite
snatched
the
paper
from
the
waiter
s
hand
it
was
in
fact
a
letter
stop
said
she
there
is
no
address
but
this
is
what
is
written
on
it
this
is
the
surprise
she
tore
the
letter
open
hastily
opened
it
and
read
she
knew
how
to
read
our
beloved
you
must
know
that
we
have
parents
parents
you
do
not
know
much
about
such
things
they
are
called
fathers
and
mothers
by
the
civil
code
which
is
puerile
and
honest
now
these
parents
groan
these
old
folks
implore
us
these
good
men
and
these
good
women
call
us
prodigal
sons
they
desire
our
return
and
offer
to
kill
calves
for
us
being
virtuous
we
obey
them
at
the
hour
when
you
read
this
five
fiery
horses
will
be
bearing
us
to
our
papas
and
mammas
we
are
pulling
up
our
stakes
as
bossuet

we
are
going
we
are
gone
we
flee
in
the
arms
of
lafitte
and
on
the
wings
of
caillard
the
toulouse
diligence
tears
us
from
the
abyss
and
the
abyss
is
you
o
our
little
beauties
we
return
to
society
to
duty
to
respectability
at
full
trot
at
the
rate
of
three
leagues
an
hour
it
is
necessary
for
the
good
of
the

that
we
should
be

fathers
of

venerate
us
we
are

ourselves
mourn
for
us
in

and
replace
us
with
speed
if
this
letter
lacerates
you
do
the
same
by
it
adieu
for
the

two
years

there
was
at
montfermeil
near
paris
during
the
first
quarter
of
this
century
a
sort
of
cook
shop
which
no
longer
exists
this
cook
shop
was
kept
by
some
people
named
thenardier
husband
and
wife
it
was
situated
in
boulanger
lane
over
the
door
there
was
a
board
nailed
flat
against
the
wall
upon
this
board
was
painted
something
which
resembled
a
man
carrying
another
man
on
his
back
the
latter
wearing
the
big
gilt
epaulettes
of
a
general
with
large
silver
stars

of

of

this
inscription
at
the
sign
of

nothing
is
more
common
than
a
cart
or
a
truck
at
the
door
of
a
hostelry
nevertheless
the
vehicle
or
to
speak
more
accurately
the
fragment
of
a
vehicle
which
encumbered
the
street
in
front
of
the
cook
shop
of
the
sergeant
of
waterloo
one
evening
in
the
spring
of
1818
would
certainly
have
attracted
by
its
mass
the
attention
of
any
painter
who
had
passed
that
way
it
was
the
fore
carriage
of
one
of
those
trucks
which
are
used
in
wooded
tracts
of
country
and
which
serve
to
transport
thick
planks
and
the
trunks
of
trees
this
fore
carriage
was
composed
of
a
massive
iron
axle
tree
with
a
pivot
into
which
was
fitted
a
heavy
shaft
and
which
was
supported
by
two
huge
wheels
the
whole
thing
was
compact
overwhelming
and
misshapen
it
seemed
like
the
gun
carriage
of
an
enormous
cannon
the
ruts
of
the
road
had
bestowed
on
the
wheels
the
fellies
the
hub
the
axle
and
the
shaft
a
layer
of
mud
a
hideous
yellowish
daubing
hue
tolerably
like
that
with
which
people
are
fond
of
ornamenting
cathedrals
the
wood
was
disappearing
under
mud
and
the
iron
beneath
rust
under
the
axle
tree
hung
like
drapery
a
huge
chain
worthy
of
some
goliath
of
a
convict
this
chain
suggested
not
the
beams
which
it
was
its
office
to
transport
but
the
mastodons
and
mammoths
which
it
might
have
served
to
harness
it
had
the
air
of
the
galleys
but
of
cyclopean
and
superhuman
galleys
and
it
seemed
to
have
been
detached
from
some
monster
homer
would
have
bound

with
it
and

caliban
why
was
that
fore
carriage
of
a
truck
in
that
place
in
the
street
in
the
first
place
to
encumber
the
street
next
in
order
that
it
might
finish
the
process
of
rusting
there
is
a
throng
of
institutions
in
the
old
social
order
which
one
comes
across
in
this
fashion
as
one
walks
about
outdoors
and
which
have
no
other
reasons
for
existence
than
the
above
the
centre
of
the
chain
swung
very
near
the
ground
in
the
middle
and
in
the
loop
as
in
the
rope
of
a
swing
there
were
seated
and
grouped
on
that
particular
evening
in
exquisite
interlacement
two
little
girls
one
about
two
years
and
a
half
old
the
other
eighteen
months
the
younger
in
the
arms
of
the
other
a
handkerchief
cleverly
knotted
about
them
prevented
their
falling
out
a
mother
had
caught
sight
of
that
frightful
chain
and
had
said
come
there
s
a
plaything
for
my
children
the
two
children
who
were
dressed
prettily
and
with
some
elegance
were
radiant
with
pleasure
one
would
have
said
that
they
were
two
roses
amid
old
iron
their
eyes
were
a
triumph
their
fresh
cheeks
were
full
of
laughter
one
had
chestnut
hair
the
other
brown
their
innocent
faces
were
two
delighted
surprises
a
blossoming
shrub
which
grew
near
wafted
to
the
passers
by
perfumes
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
them
the
child
of
eighteen
months
displayed
her
pretty
little
bare
stomach
with
the
chaste
indecency
of
childhood
above
and
around
these
two
delicate
heads
all
made
of
happiness
and
steeped
in
light
the
gigantic
fore
carriage
black
with
rust
almost
terrible
all
entangled
in
curves
and
wild
angles
rose
in
a
vault
like
the
entrance
of
a
cavern
a
few
paces
apart
crouching
down
upon
the
threshold
of
the
hostelry
the
mother
not
a
very
prepossessing
woman
by
the
way
though
touching
at
that
moment
was
swinging
the
two
children
by
means
of
a
long
cord
watching
them
carefully
for
fear
of
accidents
with
that
animal
and
celestial
expression
which
is
peculiar
to
maternity
at
every
backward
and
forward
swing
the
hideous
links
emitted
a
strident
sound
which
resembled
a
cry
of
rage
the
little
girls
were
in
ecstasies
the
setting
sun
mingled
in
this
joy
and
nothing
could
be
more
charming
than
this
caprice
of
chance
which
had
made
of
a
chain
of
titans
the
swing
of
cherubim
as
she
rocked
her
little
ones
the
mother
hummed
in
a
discordant
voice
a
romance
then
celebrated
it
must
be
said
a
warrior
her
song
and
the
contemplation
of
her
daughters
prevented
her
hearing
and
seeing
what
was
going
on
in
the
street
in
the
meantime
some
one
had
approached
her
as
she
was
beginning
the
first
couplet
of
the
romance
and
suddenly
she
heard
a
voice
saying
very
near
her
ear
you
have
two
beautiful
children
there
madame
to
the
fair
and
tender
imogene
replied
the
mother
continuing
her
romance
then
she
turned
her
head
a
woman
stood
before
her
a
few
paces
distant
this
woman
also
had
a
child
which
she
carried
in
her
arms
she
was
carrying
in
addition
a
large
carpet
bag
which
seemed
very
heavy
this
woman
s
child
was
one
of
the
most
divine
creatures
that
it
is
possible
to
behold
it
was
a
girl
two
or
three
years
of
age
she
could
have
entered
into
competition
with
the
two
other
little
ones
so
far
as
the
coquetry
of
her
dress
was
concerned
she
wore
a
cap
of
fine
linen
ribbons
on
her
bodice
and
valenciennes
lace
on
her
cap
the
folds
of
her
skirt
were
raised
so
as
to
permit
a
view
of
her
white
firm
and
dimpled
leg
she
was
admirably
rosy
and
healthy
the
little
beauty
inspired
a
desire
to
take
a
bite
from
the
apples
of
her
cheeks
of
her
eyes
nothing
could
be
known
except
that
they
must
be
very
large
and
that
they
had
magnificent
lashes
she
was
asleep
she
slept
with
that
slumber
of
absolute
confidence
peculiar
to
her
age
the
arms
of
mothers
are
made
of
tenderness
in
them
children
sleep
profoundly
as
for
the
mother
her
appearance
was
sad
and
poverty
stricken
she
was
dressed
like
a
working
woman
who
is
inclined
to
turn
into
a
peasant
again
she
was
young
was
she
handsome
perhaps
but
in
that
attire
it
was
not
apparent
her
hair
a
golden
lock
of
which
had
escaped
seemed
very
thick
but
was
severely
concealed
beneath
an
ugly
tight
close
nun
like
cap
tied
under
the
chin
a
smile
displays
beautiful
teeth
when
one
has
them
but
she
did
not
smile
her
eyes
did
not
seem
to
have
been
dry
for
a
very
long
time
she
was
pale
she
had
a
very
weary
and
rather
sickly
appearance
she
gazed
upon
her
daughter
asleep
in
her
arms
with
the
air
peculiar
to
a
mother
who
has
nursed
her
own
child
a
large
blue
handkerchief
such
as
the
invalides
use
was
folded
into
a
fichu
and
concealed
her
figure
clumsily
her
hands
were
sunburnt
and
all
dotted
with
freckles
her
forefinger
was
hardened
and
lacerated
with
the
needle
she
wore
a
cloak
of
coarse
brown
woollen
stuff
a
linen
gown
and
coarse
shoes
it
was
fantine
it
was
fantine
but
difficult
to
recognize
nevertheless
on
scrutinizing
her
attentively
it
was
evident
that
she
still
retained
her
beauty
a
melancholy
fold
which
resembled
the
beginning
of
irony
wrinkled
her
right
cheek
as
for
her
toilette
that
aerial
toilette
of
muslin
and
ribbons
which
seemed
made
of
mirth
of
folly
and
of
music
full
of
bells
and
perfumed
with
lilacs
had
vanished
like
that
beautiful
and
dazzling
hoar
frost
which
is
mistaken
for
diamonds
in
the
sunlight
it
melts
and
leaves
the
branch
quite
black
ten
months
had
elapsed
since
the
pretty
farce
what
had
taken
place
during
those
ten
months
it
can
be
divined
after
abandonment
straightened
circumstances
fantine
had
immediately
lost
sight
of
favourite
zephine
and
dahlia
the
bond
once
broken
on
the
side
of
the
men
it
was
loosed
between
the
women
they
would
have
been
greatly
astonished
had
any
one
told
them
a
fortnight
later
that
they
had
been
friends
there
no
longer
existed
any
reason
for
such
a
thing
fantine
had
remained
alone
the
father
of
her
child
gone
alas
such
ruptures
are
irrevocable
she
found
herself
absolutely
isolated
minus
the
habit
of
work
and
plus
the
taste
for
pleasure
drawn
away
by
her
liaison
with
tholomyes
to
disdain
the
pretty
trade
which
she
knew
she
had
neglected
to
keep
her
market
open
it
was
now
closed
to
her
she
had
no
resource
fantine
barely
knew
how
to
read
and
did
not
know
how
to
write
in
her
childhood
she
had
only
been
taught
to
sign
her
name
she
had
a
public
letter
writer
indite
an
epistle
to
tholomyes
then
a
second
then
a
third
tholomyes
replied
to
none
of
them
fantine
heard
the
gossips
say
as
they
looked
at
her
child
who
takes
those
children
seriously
one
only
shrugs
one
s
shoulders
over
such
children
then
she
thought
of
tholomyes
who
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
over
his
child
and
who
did
not
take
that
innocent
being
seriously
and
her
heart
grew
gloomy
toward
that
man
but
what
was
she
to
do
she
no
longer
knew
to
whom
to
apply
she
had
committed
a
fault
but
the
foundation
of
her
nature
as
will
be
remembered
was
modesty
and
virtue
she
was
vaguely
conscious
that
she
was
on
the
verge
of
falling
into
distress
and
of
gliding
into
a
worse
state
courage
was
necessary
she
possessed
it
and
held
herself
firm
the
idea
of
returning
to
her
native
town
of
m
sur
m
occurred
to
her
there
some
one
might
possibly
know
her
and
give
her
work
yes
but
it
would
be
necessary
to
conceal
her
fault
in
a
confused
way
she
perceived
the
necessity
of
a
separation
which
would
be
more
painful
than
the
first
one
her
heart
contracted
but
she
took
her
resolution
fantine
as
we
shall
see
had
the
fierce
bravery
of
life
she
had
already
valiantly
renounced
finery
had
dressed
herself
in
linen
and
had
put
all
her
silks
all
her
ornaments
all
her
ribbons
and
all
her
laces
on
her
daughter
the
only
vanity
which
was
left
to
her
and
a
holy
one
it
was
she
sold
all
that
she
had
which
produced
for
her
two
hundred
francs
her
little
debts
paid
she
had
only
about
eighty
francs
left
at
the
age
of
twenty
two
on
a
beautiful
spring
morning
she
quitted
paris
bearing
her
child
on
her
back
any
one
who
had
seen
these
two
pass
would
have
had
pity
on
them
this
woman
had
in
all
the
world
nothing
but
her
child
and
the
child
had
in
all
the
world
no
one
but
this
woman
fantine
had
nursed
her
child
and
this
had
tired
her
chest
and
she
coughed
a
little
we
shall
have
no
further
occasion
to
speak
of
m
felix
tholomyes
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
saying
that
twenty
years
later
under
king
louis
philippe
he
was
a
great
provincial
lawyer
wealthy
and
influential
a
wise
elector
and
a
very
severe
juryman
he
was
still
a
man
of
pleasure
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
after
having
from
time
to
time
for
the
sake
of
resting
herself
travelled
for
three
or
four
sous
a
league
in
what
was
then
known
as
the
petites
voitures
des
environs
de
paris
the
little
suburban
coach
service
fantine
found
herself
at
montfermeil
in
the
alley
boulanger
as
she
passed
the
thenardier
hostelry
the
two
little
girls
blissful
in
the
monster
swing
had
dazzled
her
in
a
manner
and
she
had
halted
in
front
of
that
vision
of
joy
charms
exist
these
two
little
girls
were
a
charm
to
this
mother
she
gazed
at
them
in
much
emotion
the
presence
of
angels
is
an
announcement
of
paradise
she
thought
that
above
this
inn
she
beheld
the
mysterious
here
of
providence
these
two
little
creatures
were
evidently
happy
she
gazed
at
them
she
admired
them
in
such
emotion
that
at
the
moment
when
their
mother
was
recovering
her
breath
between
two
couplets
of
her
song
she
could
not
refrain
from
addressing
to
her
the
remark
which
we
have
just
read
you
have
two
pretty
children
madame
the
most
ferocious
creatures
are
disarmed
by
caresses
bestowed
on
their
young
the
mother
raised
her
head
and
thanked
her
and
bade
the
wayfarer
sit
down
on
the
bench
at
the
door
she
herself
being
seated
on
the
threshold
the
two
women
began
to
chat
my
name
is
madame
thenardier
said
the
mother
of
the
two
little
girls
we
keep
this
inn
then
her
mind
still
running
on
her
romance
she
resumed
humming
between
her
teeth
it
must
be
so
i
am
a
knight
and
i
am
off
to
palestine
this
madame
thenardier
was
a
sandy
complexioned
woman
thin
and
angular
the
type
of
the
soldier
s
wife
in
all
its
unpleasantness
and
what
was
odd
with
a
languishing
air
which
she
owed
to
her
perusal
of
romances
she
was
a
simpering
but
masculine
creature
old
romances
produce
that
effect
when
rubbed
against
the
imagination
of
cook
shop
woman
she
was
still
young
she
was
barely
thirty
if
this
crouching
woman
had
stood
upright
her
lofty
stature
and
her
frame
of
a
perambulating
colossus
suitable
for
fairs
might
have
frightened
the
traveller
at
the
outset
troubled
her
confidence
and
disturbed
what
caused
what
we
have
to
relate
to
vanish
a
person
who
is
seated
instead
of
standing
erect
destinies
hang
upon
such
a
thing
as
that
the
traveller
told
her
story
with
slight
modifications
that
she
was
a
working
woman
that
her
husband
was
dead
that
her
work
in
paris
had
failed
her
and
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
seek
it
elsewhere
in
her
own
native
parts
that
she
had
left
paris
that
morning
on
foot
that
as
she
was
carrying
her
child
and
felt
fatigued
she
had
got
into
the
villemomble
coach
when
she
met
it
that
from
villemomble
she
had
come
to
montfermeil
on
foot
that
the
little
one
had
walked
a
little
but
not
much
because
she
was
so
young
and
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
take
her
up
and
the
jewel
had
fallen
asleep
at
this
word
she
bestowed
on
her
daughter
a
passionate
kiss
which
woke
her
the
child
opened
her
eyes
great
blue
eyes
like
her
mother
s
and
looked
at
what
nothing
with
that
serious
and
sometimes
severe
air
of
little
children
which
is
a
mystery
of
their
luminous
innocence
in
the
presence
of
our
twilight
of
virtue
one
would
say
that
they
feel
themselves
to
be
angels
and
that
they
know
us
to
be
men
then
the
child
began
to
laugh
and
although
the
mother
held
fast
to
her
she
slipped
to
the
ground
with
the
unconquerable
energy
of
a
little
being
which
wished
to
run
all
at
once
she
caught
sight
of
the
two
others
in
the
swing
stopped
short
and
put
out
her
tongue
in
sign
of
admiration
mother
thenardier
released
her
daughters
made
them
descend
from
the
swing
and
said
now
amuse
yourselves
all
three
of
you
children
become
acquainted
quickly
at
that
age
and
at
the
expiration
of
a
minute
the
little
thenardiers
were
playing
with
the
new
comer
at
making
holes
in
the
ground
which
was
an
immense
pleasure
the
new
comer
was
very
gay
the
goodness
of
the
mother
is
written
in
the
gayety
of
the
child
she
had
seized
a
scrap
of
wood
which
served
her
for
a
shovel
and
energetically
dug
a
cavity
big
enough
for
a
fly
the
grave
digger
s
business
becomes
a
subject
for
laughter
when
performed
by
a
child
the
two
women
pursued
their
chat
what
is
your
little
one
s
name
cosette
for
cosette
read
euphrasie
the
child
s
name
was
euphrasie
but
out
of
euphrasie
the
mother
had
made
cosette
by
that
sweet
and
graceful
instinct
of
mothers
and
of
the
populace
which
changes
josepha
into
pepita
and
francoise
into
sillette
it
is
a
sort
of
derivative
which
disarranges
and
disconcerts
the
whole
science
of
etymologists
we
have
known
a
grandmother
who
succeeded
in
turning
theodore
into
gnon
how
old
is
she
she
is
going
on
three
that
is
the
age
of
my
eldest
in
the
meantime
the
three
little
girls
were
grouped
in
an
attitude
of
profound
anxiety
and
blissfulness
an
event
had
happened
a
big
worm
had
emerged
from
the
ground
and
they
were
afraid
and
they
were
in
ecstasies
over
it
their
radiant
brows
touched
each
other
one
would
have
said
that
there
were
three
heads
in
one
aureole
how
easily
children
get
acquainted
at
once
exclaimed
mother
thenardier
one
would
swear
that
they
were
three
sisters
this
remark
was
probably
the
spark
which
the
other
mother
had
been
waiting
for
she
seized
the
thenardier
s
hand
looked
at
her
fixedly
and
said
will
you
keep
my
child
for
me
the
thenardier
made
one
of
those
movements
of
surprise
which
signify
neither
assent
nor
refusal
cosette
s
mother
continued
you
see
i
cannot
take
my
daughter
to
the
country
my
work
will
not
permit
it
with
a
child
one
can
find
no
situation
people
are
ridiculous
in
the
country
it
was
the
good
god
who
caused
me
to
pass
your
inn
when
i
caught
sight
of
your
little
ones
so
pretty
so
clean
and
so
happy
it
overwhelmed
me
i
said
here
is
a
good
mother
that
is
just
the
thing
that
will
make
three
sisters
and
then
it
will
not
be
long
before
i
return
will
you
keep
my
child
for
me
i
must
see
about
it
replied
the
thenardier
i
will
give
you
six
francs
a
month
here
a
man
s
voice
called
from
the
depths
of
the
cook
shop
not
for
less
than
seven
francs
and
six
months
paid
in
advance
six
times
seven
makes
forty
two
said
the
thenardier
i
will
give
it
said
the
mother
and
fifteen
francs
in
addition
for
preliminary
expenses
added
the
man
s
voice
total
fifty
seven
francs
said
madame
thenardier
and
she
hummed
vaguely
with
these
figures
it
must
be
said
a
warrior
i
will
pay
it
said
the
mother
i
have
eighty
francs
i
shall
have
enough
left
to
reach
the
country
by
travelling
on
foot
i
shall
earn
money
there
and
as
soon
as
i
have
a
little
i
will
return
for
my
darling
the
man
s
voice
resumed
the
little
one
has
an
outfit
that
is
my
husband
said
the
thenardier
of
course
she
has
an
outfit
the
poor
treasure
i
understood
perfectly
that
it
was
your
husband
and
a
beautiful
outfit
too
a
senseless
outfit
everything
by
the
dozen
and
silk
gowns
like
a
lady
it
is
here
in
my
carpet
bag
you
must
hand
it
over
struck
in
the
man
s
voice
again
of
course
i
shall
give
it
to
you
said
the
mother
it
would
be
very
queer
if
i
were
to
leave
my
daughter
quite
naked
the
master
s
face
appeared
that
s
good
said
he
the
bargain
was
concluded
the
mother
passed
the
night
at
the
inn
gave
up
her
money
and
left
her
child
fastened
her
carpet
bag
once
more
now
reduced
in
volume
by
the
removal
of
the
outfit
and
light
henceforth
and
set
out
on
the
following
morning
intending
to
return
soon
people
arrange
such
departures
tranquilly
but
they
are
despairs
a
neighbor
of
the
thenardiers
met
this
mother
as
she
was
setting
out
and
came
back
with
the
remark
i
have
just
seen
a
woman
crying
in
the
street
so
that
it
was
enough
to
rend
your
heart
when
cosette
s
mother
had
taken
her
departure
the
man
said
to
the
woman
that
will
serve
to
pay
my
note
for
one
hundred
and
ten
francs
which
falls
due
to
morrow
i
lacked
fifty
francs
do
you
know
that
i
should
have
had
a
bailiff
and
a
protest
after
me
you
played
the
mouse
trap
nicely
with
your
young
ones
without
suspecting
it
said
the
woman
chapter
ii
first
sketch
of
two
unprepossessing
figures
the
mouse
which
had
been
caught
was
a
pitiful
specimen
but
the
cat
rejoices
even
over
a
lean
mouse
who
were
these
thenardiers
let
us
say
a
word
or
two
of
them
now
we
will
complete
the
sketch
later
on
these
beings
belonged
to
that
bastard
class
composed
of
coarse
people
who
have
been
successful
and
of
intelligent
people
who
have
descended
in
the
scale
which
is
between
the
class
called
middle
and
the
class
denominated
as
inferior
and
which
combines
some
of
the
defects
of
the
second
with
nearly
all
the
vices
of
the
first
without
possessing
the
generous
impulse
of
the
workingman
nor
the
honest
order
of
the
bourgeois
they
were
of
those
dwarfed
natures
which
if
a
dull
fire
chances
to
warm
them
up
easily
become
monstrous
there
was
in
the
woman
a
substratum
of
the
brute
and
in
the
man
the
material
for
a
blackguard
both
were
susceptible
in
the
highest
degree
of
the
sort
of
hideous
progress
which
is
accomplished
in
the
direction
of
evil
there
exist
crab
like
souls
which
are
continually
retreating
towards
the
darkness
retrograding
in
life
rather
than
advancing
employing
experience
to
augment
their
deformity
growing
incessantly
worse
and
becoming
more
and
more
impregnated
with
an
ever
augmenting
blackness
this
man
and
woman
possessed
such
souls
thenardier
in
particular
was
troublesome
for
a
physiognomist
one
can
only
look
at
some
men
to
distrust
them
for
one
feels
that
they
are
dark
in
both
directions
they
are
uneasy
in
the
rear
and
threatening
in
front
there
is
something
of
the
unknown
about
them
one
can
no
more
answer
for
what
they
have
done
than
for
what
they
will
do
the
shadow
which
they
bear
in
their
glance
denounces
them
from
merely
hearing
them
utter
a
word
or
seeing
them
make
a
gesture
one
obtains
a
glimpse
of
sombre
secrets
in
their
past
and
of
sombre
mysteries
in
their
future
this
thenardier
if
he
himself
was
to
be
believed
had
been
a
soldier
a
sergeant
he
said
he
had
probably
been
through
the
campaign
of
1815
and
had
even
conducted
himself
with
tolerable
valor
it
would
seem
we
shall
see
later
on
how
much
truth
there
was
in
this
the
sign
of
his
hostelry
was
in
allusion
to
one
of
his
feats
of
arms
he
had
painted
it
himself
for
he
knew
how
to
do
a
little
of
everything
and
badly
it
was
at
the
epoch
when
the
ancient
classical
romance
which
after
having
been
clelie
was
no
longer
anything
but
lodoiska
still
noble
but
ever
more
and
more
vulgar
having
fallen
from
mademoiselle
de
scuderi
to
madame
bournon
malarme
and
from
madame
de
lafayette
to
madame
barthelemy
hadot
was
setting
the
loving
hearts
of
the
portresses
of
paris
aflame
and
even
ravaging
the
suburbs
to
some
extent
madame
thenardier
was
just
intelligent
enough
to
read
this
sort
of
books
she
lived
on
them
in
them
she
drowned
what
brains
she
possessed
this
had
given
her
when
very
young
and
even
a
little
later
a
sort
of
pensive
attitude
towards
her
husband
a
scamp
of
a
certain
depth
a
ruffian
lettered
to
the
extent
of
the
grammar
coarse
and
fine
at
one
and
the
same
time
but
so
far
as
sentimentalism
was
concerned
given
to
the
perusal
of
pigault
lebrun
and
in
what
concerns
the
sex
as
he
said
in
his
jargon
a
downright
unmitigated
lout
his
wife
was
twelve
or
fifteen
years
younger
than
he
was
later
on
when
her
hair
arranged
in
a
romantically
drooping
fashion
began
to
grow
gray
when
the
magaera
began
to
be
developed
from
the
pamela
the
female
thenardier
was
nothing
but
a
coarse
vicious
woman
who
had
dabbled
in
stupid
romances
now
one
cannot
read
nonsense
with
impunity
the
result
was
that
her
eldest
daughter
was
named
eponine
as
for
the
younger
the
poor
little
thing
came
near
being
called
gulnare
i
know
not
to
what
diversion
effected
by
a
romance
of
ducray
dumenil
she
owed
the
fact
that
she
merely
bore
the
name
of
azelma
however
we
will
remark
by
the
way
everything
was
not
ridiculous
and
superficial
in
that
curious
epoch
to
which
we
are
alluding
and
which
may
be
designated
as
the
anarchy
of
baptismal
names
by
the
side
of
this
romantic
element
which
we
have
just
indicated
there
is
the
social
symptom
it
is
not
rare
for
the
neatherd
s
boy
nowadays
to
bear
the
name
of
arthur
alfred
or
alphonse
and
for
the
vicomte
if
there
are
still
any
vicomtes
to
be
called
thomas
pierre
or
jacques
this
displacement
which
places
the
elegant
name
on
the
plebeian
and
the
rustic
name
on
the
aristocrat
is
nothing
else
than
an
eddy
of
equality
the
irresistible
penetration
of
the
new
inspiration
is
there
as
everywhere
else
beneath
this
apparent
discord
there
is
a
great
and
a
profound
thing
the
french
revolution
chapter
iii
the
lark
it
is
not
all
in
all
sufficient
to
be
wicked
in
order
to
prosper
the
cook
shop
was
in
a
bad
way
thanks
to
the
traveller
s
fifty
seven
francs
thenardier
had
been
able
to
avoid
a
protest
and
to
honor
his
signature
on
the
following
month
they
were
again
in
need
of
money
the
woman
took
cosette
s
outfit
to
paris
and
pawned
it
at
the
pawnbroker
s
for
sixty
francs
as
soon
as
that
sum
was
spent
the
thenardiers
grew
accustomed
to
look
on
the
little
girl
merely
as
a
child
whom
they
were
caring
for
out
of
charity
and
they
treated
her
accordingly
as
she
had
no
longer
any
clothes
they
dressed
her
in
the
cast
off
petticoats
and
chemises
of
the
thenardier
brats
that
is
to
say
in
rags
they
fed
her
on
what
all
the
rest
had
left
a
little
better
than
the
dog
a
little
worse
than
the
cat
moreover
the
cat
and
the
dog
were
her
habitual
table
companions
cosette
ate
with
them
under
the
table
from
a
wooden
bowl
similar
to
theirs
the
mother
who
had
established
herself
as
we
shall
see
later
on
at
m
sur
m
wrote
or
more
correctly
caused
to
be
written
a
letter
every
month
that
she
might
have
news
of
her
child
the
thenardiers
replied
invariably
cosette
is
doing
wonderfully
well
at
the
expiration
of
the
first
six
months
the
mother
sent
seven
francs
for
the
seventh
month
and
continued
her
remittances
with
tolerable
regularity
from
month
to
month
the
year
was
not
completed
when
thenardier
said
a
fine
favor
she
is
doing
us
in
sooth
what
does
she
expect
us
to
do
with
her
seven
francs
and
he
wrote
to
demand
twelve
francs
the
mother
whom
they
had
persuaded
into
the
belief
that
her
child
was
happy
and
was
coming
on
well
submitted
and
forwarded
the
twelve
francs
certain
natures
cannot
love
on
the
one
hand
without
hating
on
the
other
mother
thenardier
loved
her
two
daughters
passionately
which
caused
her
to
hate
the
stranger
it
is
sad
to
think
that
the
love
of
a
mother
can
possess
villainous
aspects
little
as
was
the
space
occupied
by
cosette
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
it
were
taken
from
her
own
and
that
that
little
child
diminished
the
air
which
her
daughters
breathed
this
woman
like
many
women
of
her
sort
had
a
load

of
blows
and
injuries
to
dispense
each

if
she
had
not
had

it
is
certain
that
her
daughters
idolized
as
they
were
would
have
received
the
whole
of
it
but
the
stranger
did
them
the
service
to
divert
the
blows
to
herself
her
daughters
received
nothing
but
caresses
cosette
could
not
make
a
motion
which
did
not
draw
down
upon
her
head
a
heavy
shower
of
violent
blows
and
unmerited
chastisement
the
sweet
feeble
being
who
should
not
have

of
this

age

then
another
people
in

said
those

are
good
people
they
are
not
rich
and
yet
they
are
bringing
up
a
poor
child
who
was
abandoned
on
their
hands
they
thought
that
cosette
s
mother
had
forgotten
her
in
the
meanwhile
thenardier
having
learned
it
is
impossible
to
say
by
what
obscure
means
that
the
child
was
probably
a
bastard
and
that
the
mother
could
not
acknowledge
it
exacted
fifteen
francs
a
month
saying
that
the
creature
was
growing
and
eating
and
threatening
to

the

from

to

the
child
grew
and
so
did
her
wretchedness
as
long
as
cosette
was
little
she
was
the
scape
goat
of
the
two
other
children
as
soon
as
she
began
to
develop
a
little
that
is
to
say
before
she
was
even
five
years
old
she
became
the
servant
of
the
household
five
years
old
the
reader
will
say
that
is
not
probable
alas
it
is
true
social
suffering
begins
at
all
ages
have
we
not
recently
seen
the
trial
of
a
man
named
dumollard
an
orphan
turned
bandit
who
from
the
age
of
five
as
the
official
documents
state
being
alone
in
the
world
worked
for
his
living
and
stole
cosette
was
made
to
run
on
errands
to
sweep
the
rooms
the
courtyard
the
street
to
wash
the
dishes
to
even
carry
burdens
the
thenardiers
considered
themselves
all
the
more
authorized
to
behave
in
this
manner
since
the
mother
who
was
still
at
m
sur
m
had
become
irregular
in
her
payments
some
months
she
was
in
arrears
if
this
mother
had
returned
to
montfermeil
at
the
end
of
these
three
years
she
would
not
have
recognized
her
child
cosette
so
pretty
and
rosy
on
her
arrival
in
that
house
was
now
thin
and
pale
she
had
an
indescribably
uneasy
look
the
sly
creature
said
the
thenardiers
injustice
had
made
her
peevish
and
misery
had
made
her
ugly
nothing
remained
to
her
except
her
beautiful
eyes
which
inspired
pain
because
large
as
they
were
it
seemed
as
though
one
beheld
in
them
a
still
larger
amount
of
sadness
it
was
a
heart
breaking
thing
to
see
this
poor
child
not
yet
six
years
old
shivering
in
the
winter
in
her
old
rags
of
linen
full
of
holes
sweeping

according

m
sur

this
it
will
be
remembered
was
in
1818
fantine
had
quitted
her
province
ten
years
before
m
sur
m
had
changed
its
aspect
while
fantine
had
been
slowly
descending
from
wretchedness
to
wretchedness
her
native
town
had
prospered
about
two
years
previously
one
of
those
industrial
facts
which
are
the
grand
events
of
small
districts
had
taken
place
this
detail
is
important
and
we
regard
it
as
useful
to
develop
it
at
length
we
should
almost
say
to
underline
it
from
time
immemorial
m
sur
m
had
had
for
its
special
industry
the
imitation
of
english
jet
and
the
black
glass
trinkets
of
germany
this
industry
had
always
vegetated
on
account
of
the
high
price
of
the
raw
material
which
reacted
on
the
manufacture
at
the
moment
when
fantine
returned
to
m
sur
m
an
unheard
of
transformation
had
taken
place
in
the
production
of
black
goods
towards
the
close
of
1815
a
man
a
stranger
had
established
himself
in
the
town
and
had
been
inspired
with
the
idea
of
substituting
in
this
manufacture
gum
lac
for
resin
and
for
bracelets
in
particular
slides
of
sheet
iron
simply
laid
together
for
slides
of
soldered
sheet
iron
this
very
small
change
had
effected
a
revolution
this
very
small
change
had
in
fact
prodigiously
reduced
the
cost
of
the
raw
material
which
had
rendered
it
possible
in
the
first
place
to
raise
the
price
of
manufacture
a
benefit
to
the
country
in
the
second
place
to
improve
the
workmanship
an
advantage
to
the
consumer
in
the
third
place
to
sell
at
a
lower
price
while
trebling
the
profit
which
was
a
benefit
to
the
manufacturer
thus
three
results
ensued
from
one
idea
in
less
than
three
years
the
inventor
of
this
process
had
become
rich
which
is
good
and
had
made
every
one
about
him
rich
which
is
better
he
was
a
stranger
in
the
department
of
his
origin
nothing
was
known
of
the
beginning
of
his
career
very
little
it
was
rumored
that
he
had
come
to
town
with
very
little
money
a
few
hundred
francs
at
the
most
it
was
from
this
slender
capital
enlisted
in
the
service
of
an
ingenious
idea
developed
by
method
and
thought
that
he
had
drawn
his
own
fortune
and
the
fortune
of
the
whole
countryside
on
his
arrival
at
m
sur
m
he
had
only
the
garments
the
appearance
and
the
language
of
a
workingman
it
appears
that
on
the
very
day
when
he
made
his
obscure
entry
into
the
little
town
of
m
sur
m
just
at
nightfall
on
a
december
evening
knapsack
on
back
and
thorn
club
in
hand
a
large
fire
had
broken
out
in
the
town
hall
this
man
had
rushed
into
the
flames
and
saved
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
two
children
who
belonged
to
the
captain
of
the
gendarmerie
this
is
why
they
had
forgotten
to
ask
him
for
his
passport
afterwards
they
had
learned
his
name
he
was
called
father
madeleine
chapter
ii
madeleine
he
was
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
who
had
a
preoccupied
air
and
who
was
good
that
was
all
that
could
be
said
about
him
thanks
to
the
rapid
progress
of
the
industry
which
he
had
so
admirably
re
constructed
m
sur
m
had
become
a
rather
important
centre
of
trade
spain
which
consumes
a
good
deal
of
black
jet
made
enormous
purchases
there
each
year
m
sur
m
almost
rivalled
london
and
berlin
in
this
branch
of
commerce
father
madeleine
s
profits
were
such
that
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
he
was
able
to
erect
a
large
factory
in
which
there
were
two
vast
workrooms
one
for
the
men
and
the
other
for
women
any
one
who
was
hungry
could
present
himself
there
and
was
sure
of
finding
employment
and
bread
father
madeleine
required
of
the
men
good
will
of
the
women
pure
morals
and
of
all
probity
he
had
separated
the
work
rooms
in
order
to
separate
the
sexes
and
so
that
the
women
and
girls
might
remain
discreet
on
this
point
he
was
inflexible
it
was
the
only
thing
in
which
he
was
in
a
manner
intolerant
he
was
all
the
more
firmly
set
on
this
severity
since
m
sur
m
being
a
garrison
town
opportunities
for
corruption
abounded
however
his
coming
had
been
a
boon
and
his
presence
was
a
godsend
before
father
madeleine
s
arrival
everything
had
languished
in
the
country
now
everything
lived
with
a
healthy
life
of
toil
a
strong
circulation
warmed
everything
and
penetrated
everywhere
slack
seasons
and
wretchedness
were
unknown
there
was
no
pocket
so
obscure
that
it
had
not
a
little
money
in
it
no
dwelling
so
lowly
that
there
was
not
some
little
joy
within
it
father
madeleine
gave
employment
to
every
one
he
exacted
but
one
thing
be
an
honest
man
be
an
honest
woman
as
we
have
said
in
the
midst
of
this
activity
of
which
he
was
the
cause
and
the
pivot
father
madeleine
made
his
fortune
but
a
singular
thing
in
a
simple
man
of
business
it
did
not
seem
as
though
that
were
his
chief
care
he
appeared
to
be
thinking
much
of
others
and
little
of
himself
in
1820
he
was
known
to
have
a
sum
of
six
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
francs
lodged
in
his
name
with
laffitte
but
before
reserving
these
six
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
francs
he
had
spent
more
than
a
million
for
the
town
and
its
poor
the
hospital
was
badly
endowed
he
founded
six
beds
there
m
sur
m
is
divided
into
the
upper
and
the
lower
town
the
lower
town
in
which
he
lived
had
but
one
school
a
miserable
hovel
which
was
falling
to
ruin
he
constructed
two
one
for
girls
the
other
for
boys
he
allotted
a
salary
from
his
own
funds
to
the
two
instructors
a
salary
twice
as
large
as
their
meagre
official
salary
and
one
day
he
said
to
some
one
who
expressed
surprise
the
two
prime
functionaries
of
the
state
are
the
nurse
and
the
schoolmaster
he
created
at
his
own
expense
an
infant
school
a
thing
then
almost
unknown
in
france
and
a
fund
for
aiding
old
and
infirm
workmen
as
his
factory
was
a
centre
a
new
quarter
in
which
there
were
a
good
many
indigent
families
rose
rapidly
around
him
he
established
there
a
free
dispensary
at
first
when
they
watched
his
beginnings
the
good
souls
said
he
s
a
jolly
fellow
who
means
to
get
rich
when
they
saw
him
enriching
the
country
before
he
enriched
himself
the
good
souls
said
he
is
an
ambitious
man
this
seemed
all
the
more
probable
since
the
man
was
religious
and
even
practised
his
religion
to
a
certain
degree
a
thing
which
was
very
favorably
viewed
at
that
epoch
he
went
regularly
to
low
mass
every
sunday
the
local
deputy
who
nosed
out
all
rivalry
everywhere
soon
began
to
grow
uneasy
over
this
religion
this
deputy
had
been
a
member
of
the
legislative
body
of
the
empire
and
shared
the
religious
ideas
of
a
father
of
the
oratoire
known
under
the
name
of
fouche
duc
d
otrante
whose
creature
and
friend
he
had
been
he
indulged
in
gentle
raillery
at
god
with
closed
doors
but
when
he
beheld
the
wealthy
manufacturer
madeleine
going
to
low
mass
at
seven
o
clock
he
perceived
in
him
a
possible
candidate
and
resolved
to
outdo
him
he
took
a
jesuit
confessor
and
went
to
high
mass
and
to
vespers
ambition
was
at
that
time
in
the
direct
acceptation
of
the
word
a
race
to
the
steeple
the
poor
profited
by
this
terror
as
well
as
the
good
god
for
the
honorable
deputy
also
founded
two
beds
in
the
hospital
which
made
twelve
nevertheless
in
1819
a
rumor
one
morning
circulated
through
the
town
to
the
effect
that
on
the
representations
of
the
prefect
and
in
consideration
of
the
services
rendered
by
him
to
the
country
father
madeleine
was
to
be
appointed
by
the
king
mayor
of
m
sur
m
those
who
had
pronounced
this
new
comer
to
be
an
ambitious
fellow
seized
with
delight
on
this
opportunity
which
all
men
desire
to
exclaim
there
what
did
we
say
all
m
sur
m
was
in
an
uproar
the
rumor
was
well
founded
several
days
later
the
appointment
appeared
in
the
moniteur
on
the
following
day
father
madeleine
refused
in
this
same
year
of
1819
the
products
of
the
new
process
invented
by
madeleine
figured
in
the
industrial
exhibition
when
the
jury
made
their
report
the
king
appointed
the
inventor
a
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honor
a
fresh
excitement
in
the
little
town
well
so
it
was
the
cross
that
he
wanted
father
madeleine
refused
the
cross
decidedly
this
man
was
an
enigma
the
good
souls
got
out
of
their
predicament
by
saying
after
all
he
is
some
sort
of
an
adventurer
we
have
seen
that
the
country
owed
much
to
him
the
poor
owed
him
everything
he
was
so
useful
and
he
was
so
gentle
that
people
had
been
obliged
to
honor
and
respect
him
his
workmen
in
particular
adored
him
and
he
endured
this
adoration
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
gravity
when
he
was
known
to
be
rich
people
in
society
bowed
to
him
and
he
received
invitations
in
the
town
he
was
called
in
town
monsieur
madeleine
his
workmen
and
the
children
continued
to
call
him
father
madeleine
and
that
was
what
was
most
adapted
to
make
him
smile
in
proportion
as
he
mounted
throve
invitations
rained
down
upon
him
society
claimed
him
for
its
own

to
the

they
made
a
thousand
advances
to
him
he
refused
this
time
the
good
gossips
had
no
trouble
he
is
an
ignorant
man
of
no
education
no
one
knows
where
he
came
from
he
would
not
know
how
to
behave
in
society
it
has
not
been
absolutely
proved
that
he
knows
how
to
read
when
they
saw
him
making
money
they
said
he
is
a
man
of

five
years
after
his
arrival
in

the
services
which
he
had
rendered
to
the
district
were
so
dazzling
the
opinion
of
the
whole
country
round
about
was
so
unanimous
that
the
king
again
appointed
him
mayor
of
the
town
he
again
declined
but
the
prefect
resisted
his
refusal
all
the
notabilities
of
the
place
came
to
implore
him
the
people
in
the
street
besought
him
the
urging
was
so
vigorous
that
he
ended
by
accepting
it
was
noticed
that
the
thing
which
seemed
chiefly
to
bring
him
to
a
decision
was
the
almost
irritated
apostrophe
addressed
to
him
by
an
old
woman
of
the
people
who
called
to
him
from
her
threshold
in

angry
way

exception
he
lived
in
solitude
he
spoke
to
but
few
people
he
avoided
polite
attentions
he
escaped
quickly
he
smiled
to
relieve
himself
of
the
necessity
of
talking
he
gave
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
necessity
for
smiling
the
women
said
of
him
what
a
good
natured
bear
his
pleasure
consisted
in
strolling
in
the
fields
he
always
took
his
meals
alone
with
an
open
book
before
him
which
he
read
he
had
a
well
selected
little
library
he
loved
books
books
are
cold
but
safe
friends
in
proportion
as
leisure
came
to
him
with
fortune
he
seemed
to
take
advantage
of
it
to
cultivate
his
mind
it
had
been
observed
that
ever
since
his
arrival
at
m
sur
m
his
language
had
grown
more
polished
more
choice
and
more
gentle
with
every
passing
year
he
liked
to
carry
a
gun
with
him
on
his
strolls
but
he
rarely
made
use
of
it
when
he
did
happen
to
do
so
his
shooting
was
something
so
infallible
as
to
inspire
terror
he
never
killed
an
inoffensive
animal
he
never
shot
at
a
little
bird
although
he
was
no
longer
young
it
was
thought
that
he
was
still
prodigiously
strong
he
offered
his
assistance
to
any
one
who
was
in
need
of
it
lifted
a
horse
released
a
wheel
clogged
in
the
mud
or
stopped
a
runaway
bull
by
the
horns
he
always
had
his
pockets
full
of
money
when
he
went
out
but
they
were
empty
on
his
return
when
he
passed
through
a
village
the
ragged
brats
ran
joyously
after
him
and
surrounded
him
like
a
swarm
of
gnats
it
was
thought
that
he
must
in
the
past
have
lived
a
country
life
since
he
knew
all
sorts
of
useful
secrets
which
he
taught
to
the
peasants
he
taught
them
how
to
destroy
scurf
on
wheat
by
sprinkling
it
and
the
granary
and
inundating
the
cracks
in
the
floor
with
a
solution
of
common
salt
and
how
to
chase
away
weevils
by
hanging
up
orviot
in
bloom
everywhere
on
the
walls
and
the
ceilings
among
the
grass
and
in
the
houses
he
had
recipes
for
exterminating
from
a
field
blight
tares
foxtail
and
all
parasitic
growths
which
destroy
the
wheat
he
defended
a
rabbit
warren
against
rats
simply
by
the
odor
of
a
guinea
pig
which
he
placed
in
it
one
day
he
saw
some
country
people
busily
engaged
in
pulling
up
nettles
he
examined
the
plants
which
were
uprooted
and
already
dried
and
said
they
are
dead
nevertheless
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
know
how
to
make
use
of
them
when
the
nettle
is
young
the
leaf
makes
an
excellent
vegetable
when
it
is
older
it
has
filaments
and
fibres
like
hemp
and
flax
nettle
cloth
is
as
good
as
linen
cloth
chopped
up
nettles
are
good
for
poultry
pounded
they
are
good
for
horned
cattle
the
seed
of
the
nettle
mixed
with
fodder
gives
gloss
to
the
hair
of
animals
the
root
mixed
with
salt
produces
a
beautiful
yellow
coloring
matter
moreover
it
is
an
excellent
hay
which
can
be
cut
twice
and
what
is
required
for
the
nettle
a
little
soil
no
care
no
culture
only
the
seed
falls
as
it
is
ripe
and
it
is
difficult
to
collect
it
that
is
all
with
the
exercise
of
a
little
care
the
nettle
could
be
made
useful
it
is
neglected
and
it
becomes
hurtful
it
is
exterminated
how
many
men
resemble
the
nettle
he
added
after
a
pause
remember
this
my
friends
there
are
no
such
things
as
bad
plants
or
bad
men
there
are
only
bad
cultivators
the
children
loved
him
because
he
knew
how
to
make
charming
little
trifles
of
straw
and
cocoanuts
when
he
saw
the
door
of
a
church
hung
in
black
he
entered
he
sought
out
funerals
as
other
men
seek
christenings
widowhood
and
the
grief
of
others
attracted
him
because
of
his
great
gentleness
he
mingled
with
the
friends
clad
in
mourning
with
families
dressed
in
black
with
the
priests
groaning
around
a
coffin
he
seemed
to
like
to
give
to
his
thoughts
for
text
these
funereal
psalmodies
filled
with
the
vision
of
the
other
world
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
heaven
he
listened
with
a
sort
of
aspiration
towards
all
the
mysteries
of
the
infinite
those
sad
voices
which
sing
on
the
verge
of
the
obscure
abyss
of
death
he
performed
a
multitude
of
good
actions
concealing
his
agency
in
them
as
a
man
conceals
himself
because
of
evil
actions
he
penetrated
houses
privately
at
night
he
ascended
staircases
furtively
a
poor
wretch
on
returning
to
his
attic
would
find
that
his
door
had
been
opened
sometimes
even
forced
during
his
absence
the
poor
man
made
a
clamor
over
it
some
malefactor
had
been
there
he
entered
and
the
first
thing
he
beheld
was
a
piece
of
gold
lying
forgotten
on
some
piece
of
furniture
the
malefactor
who
had
been
there
was
father
madeleine
he
was
affable
and
sad
the
people
said
there
is
a
rich
man
who
has
not
a
haughty
air
there
is
a
happy
man
who
has
not
a
contented
air
some
people
maintained
that
he
was
a
mysterious
person
and
that
no
one
ever
entered
his
chamber
which
was
a
regular
anchorite
s
cell
furnished
with
winged
hour
glasses
and
enlivened
by
cross
bones
and
skulls
of
dead
men
this
was
much
talked
of
so
that
one
of
the
elegant
and
malicious
young
women
of
m
sur
m
came
to
him
one
day
and
asked
monsieur
le
maire
pray
show
us
your
chamber
it
is
said
to
be
a
grotto
he
smiled
and
introduced
them
instantly
into
this
grotto
they
were
well
punished
for
their
curiosity
the
room
was
very
simply
furnished
in
mahogany
which
was
rather
ugly
like
all
furniture
of
that
sort
and
hung
with
paper
worth
twelve
sous
they
could
see
nothing
remarkable
about
it
except
two
candlesticks
of
antique
pattern
which
stood
on
the
chimney
piece
and
appeared
to
be
silver
for
they
were
hall
marked
an
observation
full
of
the
type
of
wit
of
petty
towns
nevertheless
people
continued
to
say
that
no
one
ever
got
into
the
room
and
that
it
was
a
hermit
s
cave
a
mysterious
retreat
a
hole
a
tomb
it
was
also
whispered
about
that
he
had
immense
sums
deposited
with
laffitte
with
this
peculiar
feature
that
they
were
always
at
his
immediate
disposal
so
that
it
was
added
m
madeleine
could
make
his
appearance
at
laffitte
s
any
morning
sign
a
receipt
and
carry
off
his
two
or
three
millions
in
ten
minutes
in
reality
these
two
or
three
millions
were
reducible
as
we
have
said
to
six
hundred
and
thirty
or
forty
thousand
francs

iv
m
madeleine
in
mourning
at
the
beginning
of
1820
the
newspapers
announced
the
death
of
m
myriel
bishop
of
d
surnamed
monseigneur
bienvenu
who
had
died
in
the
odor
of
sanctity
at
the
age
of
eighty
two
the
bishop
of
d
to
supply
here
a
detail
which
the
papers
omitted
had
been
blind
for
many
years
before
his
death
and
content
to
be
blind
as
his
sister
was
beside
him
let
us
remark
by
the
way
that
to
be
blind
and
to
be
loved
is
in
fact
one
of
the
most
strangely
exquisite
forms
of
happiness
upon
this
earth
where
nothing
is
complete
to
have
continually
at
one
s
side
a
woman
a
daughter
a
sister
a
charming
being
who
is
there
because
you
need
her
and
because
she
cannot
do
without
you
to
know
that
we
are
indispensable
to
a
person
who
is
necessary
to
us
to
be
able
to
incessantly
measure
one
s
affection
by
the
amount
of
her
presence
which
she
bestows
on
us
and
to
say
to
ourselves
since
she
consecrates
the
whole
of
her
time
to
me
it
is
because
i
possess
the
whole
of
her
heart
to
behold
her
thought
in
lieu
of
her
face
to
be
able
to
verify
the
fidelity
of
one
being
amid
the
eclipse
of
the
world
to
regard
the
rustle
of
a
gown
as
the
sound
of
wings
to
hear
her
come
and
go
retire
speak
return
sing
and
to
think
that
one
is
the
centre
of
these
steps
of
this
speech
to
manifest
at
each
instant
one
s
personal
attraction
to
feel
one
s
self
all
the
more
powerful
because
of
one
s
infirmity
to
become
in
one
s
obscurity
and
through
one
s
obscurity
the
star
around
which
this
angel
gravitates
few
felicities
equal
this
the
supreme
happiness
of
life
consists
in
the
conviction
that
one
is
loved
loved
for
one
s
own
sake
let
us
say
rather
loved
in
spite
of
one
s
self
this
conviction
the
blind
man
possesses
to
be
served
in
distress
is
to
be
caressed
does
he
lack
anything
no
one
does
not
lose
the
sight
when
one
has
love
and
what
love
a
love
wholly
constituted
of
virtue
there
is
no
blindness
where
there
is
certainty
soul
seeks
soul
gropingly
and
finds
it
and
this
soul
found
and
tested
is
a
woman
a
hand
sustains
you
it
is
hers
a
mouth
lightly
touches
your
brow
it
is
her
mouth
you
hear
a
breath
very
near
you
it
is
hers
to
have
everything
of
her
from
her
worship
to
her
pity
never
to
be
left
to
have
that
sweet
weakness
aiding
you
to
lean
upon
that
immovable
reed
to
touch
providence
with
one
s
hands
and
to
be
able
to
take
it
in
one
s
arms
god
made
tangible
what
bliss
the
heart
that
obscure
celestial
flower
undergoes
a
mysterious
blossoming
one
would
not
exchange
that
shadow
for
all
brightness
the
angel
soul
is
there
uninterruptedly
there
if
she
departs
it
is
but
to
return
again
she
vanishes
like
a
dream
and
reappears
like
reality
one
feels
warmth
approaching
and
behold
she
is
there
one
overflows
with
serenity
with
gayety
with
ecstasy
one
is
a
radiance
amid
the
night
and
there
are
a
thousand
little
cares
nothings
which
are
enormous
in
that
void
the
most
ineffable
accents
of
the
feminine
voice
employed
to
lull
you
and
supplying
the
vanished
universe
to
you
one
is
caressed
with
the
soul
one
sees
nothing
but
one
feels
that
one
is
adored
it
is
a
paradise
of
shadows
it
was
from
this
paradise
that
monseigneur
welcome
had
passed
to
the
other
the
announcement
of
his
death
was
reprinted
by
the
local
journal
of
m
sur
m
on
the
following
day
m
madeleine
appeared
clad
wholly
in
black
and
with
crape
on
his
hat
this
mourning
was
noticed
in
the
town
and
commented
on
it
seemed
to
throw
a
light
on
m
madeleine
s
origin
it
was
concluded
that
some
relationship
existed
between
him
and
the
venerable
bishop
he
has
gone
into
mourning
for
the
bishop
of
d
said
the
drawing
rooms
this
raised
m
madeleine
s
credit
greatly
and
procured
for
him
instantly
and
at
one
blow
a
certain
consideration
in
the
noble
world
of
m
sur
m
the
microscopic
faubourg
saint
germain
of
the
place
meditated
raising
the
quarantine
against
m
madeleine
the
probable
relative
of
a
bishop
m
madeleine
perceived
the
advancement
which
he
had
obtained
by
the
more
numerous
courtesies
of
the
old
women
and
the
more
plentiful
smiles
of
the
young
ones
one
evening
a
ruler
in
that
petty
great
world
who
was
curious
by
right
of
seniority
ventured
to
ask
him
m
le
maire
is
doubtless
a
cousin
of
the
late
bishop
of
d
he
said
no
madame
but
resumed
the
dowager
you
are
wearing
mourning
for
him
he
replied
it
is
because
i
was
a
servant
in
his
family
in
my
youth
another
thing
which
was
remarked
was
that
every
time
that
he
encountered
in
the
town
a
young
savoyard
who
was
roaming
about
the
country
and
seeking
chimneys
to
sweep
the
mayor
had
him
summoned
inquired
his
name
and
gave
him
money
the
little
savoyards
told
each
other
about
it
a
great
many
of
them
passed
that
way
chapter
v
vague
flashes
on
the
horizon
little
by
little
and
in
the
course
of
time
all
this
opposition
subsided
there
had
at
first
been
exercised
against
m
madeleine
in
virtue
of
a
sort
of
law
which
all
those
who
rise
must
submit
to
blackening
and
calumnies
then
they
grew
to
be
nothing
more
than
ill
nature
then
merely
malicious
remarks
then
even
this
entirely
disappeared
respect
became
complete
unanimous
cordial
and
towards
1821
the
moment
arrived
when
the
word
monsieur
le
maire
was
pronounced
at
m
sur
m
with
almost
the
same
accent
as
monseigneur
the
bishop
had
been
pronounced
in
d
in
1815
people
came
from
a
distance
of
ten
leagues
around
to
consult
m
madeleine
he
put
an
end
to
differences
he
prevented
lawsuits
he
reconciled
enemies
every
one
took
him
for
the
judge
and
with
good
reason
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
for
a
soul
the
book
of
the
natural
law
it
was
like
an
epidemic
of
veneration
which
in
the
course
of
six
or
seven
years
gradually
took
possession
of
the
whole
district
one
single
man
in
the
town
in
the
arrondissement
absolutely
escaped
this
contagion
and
whatever
father
madeleine
did
remained
his
opponent
as
though
a
sort
of
incorruptible
and
imperturbable
instinct
kept
him
on
the
alert
and
uneasy
it
seems
in
fact
as
though
there
existed
in
certain
men
a
veritable
bestial
instinct
though
pure
and
upright
like
all
instincts
which
creates
antipathies
and
sympathies
which
fatally
separates
one
nature
from
another
nature
which
does
not
hesitate
which
feels
no
disquiet
which
does
not
hold
its
peace
and
which
never
belies
itself
clear
in
its
obscurity
infallible
imperious
intractable
stubborn
to
all
counsels
of
the
intelligence
and
to
all
the
dissolvents
of
reason
and
which
in
whatever
manner
destinies
are
arranged
secretly

the
man
dog
of
the
presence
of
the
man
cat
and
the
man
fox
of
the
presence
of
the
man
lion
it
frequently
happened
that
when
m
madeleine
was
passing
along
a
street
calm
affectionate
surrounded
by
the
blessings
of
all
a
man
of
lofty
stature
clad
in
an
iron
gray
frock
coat
armed
with
a
heavy
cane
and
wearing
a
battered
hat
turned
round
abruptly
behind
him
and
followed
him
with
his
eyes
until
he
disappeared
with
folded
arms
and
a
slow
shake
of
the
head
and
his
upper
lip
raised
in
company
with
his
lower
to
his
nose
a
sort
of
significant
grimace
which
might
be
translated
by
what
is
that
man
after
all
i
certainly
have
seen
him
somewhere
in
any
case
i
am
not
his
dupe
this
person
grave
with
a
gravity
which
was
almost
menacing
was
one
of
those
men
who
even
when
only
seen
by
a
rapid
glimpse
arrest
the
spectator
s
attention
his
name
was
javert
and
he
belonged
to
the
police
at
m
sur
m
he
exercised
the
unpleasant
but
useful
functions
of
an
inspector
he
had
not
seen
madeleine
s
beginnings
javert
owed
the
post
which
he
occupied
to
the
protection
of
m
chabouillet
the
secretary
of
the
minister
of
state
comte
angeles
then
prefect
of
police
at
paris
when
javert
arrived
at
m
sur
m
the
fortune
of
the
great
manufacturer
was
already
made
and
father
madeleine
had
become
monsieur
madeleine
certain
police
officers
have
a
peculiar
physiognomy
which
is
complicated
with
an
air
of
baseness
mingled
with
an
air
of
authority
javert
possessed
this
physiognomy
minus
the
baseness
it
is
our
conviction
that
if
souls
were
visible
to
the
eyes
we
should
be
able
to
see
distinctly
that
strange
thing
that
each
one
individual
of
the
human
race
corresponds
to
some
one
of
the
species
of
the
animal
creation
and
we
could
easily
recognize
this
truth
hardly
perceived
by
the
thinker
that
from
the
oyster
to
the
eagle
from
the
pig
to
the
tiger
all
animals
exist
in
man
and
that
each
one
of
them
is
in
a
man
sometimes
even
several
of
them
at
a
time
animals
are
nothing
else
than
the
figures
of
our
virtues
and
our
vices
straying
before
our

having
made
this
reservation
let
us
pass
on
now
if
the
reader
will
admit
for
a
moment
with
us
that
in
every
man
there
is
one
of
the
animal
species
of
creation
it
will
be
easy
for
us
to
say
what
there
was
in
police
officer
javert
the
peasants
of
asturias
are
convinced
that
in
every
litter
of
wolves
there
is
one
dog
which
is
killed
by
the
mother
because
otherwise
as
he
grew
up
he
would
devour
the
other
little
ones
give
to
this
dog
son
of
a
wolf
a
human
face
and
the
result
will
be
javert
javert
had
been
born
in
prison
of
a
fortune
teller
whose
husband
was
in
the
galleys
as
he
grew
up
he
thought
that
he
was
outside
the
pale
of
society
and
he
despaired
of
ever
re
entering
it
he
observed
that
society
unpardoningly
excludes
two
classes
of
men
those
who
attack
it
and
those
who
guard
it
he
had
no
choice
except
between
these
two
classes
at
the
same
time
he
was
conscious
of
an
indescribable
foundation
of
rigidity
regularity
and
probity
complicated
with
an
inexpressible
hatred
for
the
race
of
bohemians
whence
he
was
sprung
he
entered
the
police
he
succeeded
there
at
forty
years
of
age
he
was
an
inspector
during
his
youth
he
had
been
employed
in
the
convict
establishments
of
the
south
before
proceeding
further
let
us
come
to
an
understanding
as
to
the
words
human
face
which
we
have
just
applied
to
javert
the
human
face
of
javert
consisted
of
a
flat
nose
with
two
deep
nostrils
towards
which
enormous
whiskers
ascended
on
his
cheeks
one
felt
ill
at
ease
when
he
saw
these
two
forests
and
these
two
caverns
for
the
first
time
when
javert
laughed
and
his
laugh
was
rare
and
terrible
his
thin
lips
parted
and
revealed
to
view
not
only
his
teeth
but
his
gums
and
around
his
nose
there
formed
a
flattened
and
savage
fold
as
on
the
muzzle
of
a
wild
beast
javert
serious
was
a
watchdog
when
he
laughed
he
was
a
tiger
as
for
the
rest
he
had
very
little
skull
and
a
great
deal
of
jaw
his
hair
concealed
his
forehead
and
fell
over
his
eyebrows
between
his
eyes
there
was
a
permanent
central
frown
like
an
imprint
of
wrath
his
gaze
was
obscure
his
mouth
pursed
up
and
terrible
his
air
that
of
ferocious
command
this
man
was
composed
of
two
very
simple
and
two
very
good
sentiments
comparatively
but
he
rendered
them
almost
bad
by
dint
of
exaggerating
them
respect
for
authority
hatred
of
rebellion
and
in
his
eyes
murder
robbery
all
crimes
are
only
forms
of
rebellion
he
enveloped
in
a
blind
and
profound
faith
every
one
who
had
a
function
in
the
state
from
the
prime
minister
to
the
rural
policeman
he
covered
with
scorn
aversion
and
disgust
every
one
who
had
once
crossed
the
legal
threshold
of
evil
he
was
absolute
and
admitted
no
exceptions
on
the
one
hand
he
said
the
functionary
can
make
no
mistake
the
magistrate
is
never
the
wrong
on
the
other
hand
he
said
these
men
are
irremediably
lost
nothing
good
can
come
from
them
he
fully
shared
the
opinion
of
those
extreme
minds
which
attribute
to
human
law
i
know
not
what
power
of
making
or
if
the
reader
will
have
it
so
of
authenticating
demons
and
who
place
a
styx
at
the
base
of
society
he
was
stoical
serious
austere
a
melancholy
dreamer
humble
and
haughty
like
fanatics
his
glance
was
like
a
gimlet
cold
and
piercing
his
whole
life
hung
on
these
two
words
watchfulness
and
supervision
he
had
introduced
a
straight
line
into
what
is
the
most
crooked
thing
in
the
world
he
possessed
the
conscience
of
his
usefulness
the
religion
of
his
functions
and
he
was
a
spy
as
other
men
are
priests
woe
to
the
man
who
fell
into
his
hands
he
would
have
arrested
his
own
father
if
the
latter
had
escaped
from
the
galleys
and
would
have
denounced
his
mother
if
she
had
broken
her
ban
and
he
would
have
done
it
with
that
sort
of
inward
satisfaction
which
is
conferred
by
virtue
and
withal
a
life
of
privation
isolation
abnegation
chastity
with
never
a
diversion
it
was
implacable
duty
the
police
understood
as
the
spartans
understood
sparta
a
pitiless
lying
in
wait
a
ferocious
honesty
a
marble
informer
brutus
in
vidocq
javert
s
whole
person
was
expressive
of
the
man
who
spies
and
who
withdraws
himself
from
observation
the
mystical
school
of
joseph
de
maistre
which
at
that
epoch
seasoned
with
lofty
cosmogony
those
things
which
were
called
the
ultra
newspapers
would
not
have
failed
to
declare
that
javert
was
a
symbol
his
brow
was
not
visible
it
disappeared
beneath
his
hat
his
eyes
were
not
visible
since
they
were
lost
under
his
eyebrows
his
chin
was
not
visible
for
it
was
plunged
in
his
cravat
his
hands
were
not
visible
they
were
drawn
up
in
his
sleeves
and
his
cane
was
not
visible
he
carried
it
under
his
coat
but
when
the
occasion
presented
itself
there
was
suddenly
seen
to
emerge
from
all
this
shadow
as
from
an
ambuscade
a
narrow
and
angular
forehead
a
baleful
glance
a
threatening
chin
enormous
hands
and
a
monstrous
cudgel
in
his
leisure
moments
which
were
far
from
frequent
he
read
although
he
hated
books
this
caused
him
to
be
not
wholly
illiterate
this
could
be
recognized
by
some
emphasis
in
his
speech
as
we
have
said
he
had
no
vices
when
he
was
pleased
with
himself
he
permitted
himself
a
pinch
of
snuff
therein
lay
his
connection
with
humanity
the
reader
will
have
no
difficulty
in
understanding
that
javert
was
the
terror
of
that
whole
class
which
the
annual
statistics
of
the
ministry
of
justice
designates
under
the
rubric
vagrants
the
name
of
javert
routed
them
by
its
mere
utterance
the
face
of
javert
petrified
them
at
sight
such
was
this
formidable
man
javert
was
like
an
eye
constantly
fixed
on
m
madeleine
an
eye
full
of
suspicion
and
conjecture
m
madeleine
had
finally
perceived
the
fact
but
it
seemed
to
be
of
no
importance
to
him
he
did
not
even
put
a
question
to
javert
he
neither
sought
nor
avoided
him
he
bore
that
embarrassing
and
almost
oppressive
gaze
without
appearing
to
notice
it
he
treated
javert
with
ease
and
courtesy
as
he
did
all
the
rest
of
the
world
it
was
divined
from
some
words
which
escaped
javert
that
he
had
secretly
investigated
with
that
curiosity
which
belongs
to
the
race
and
into
which
there
enters
as
much
instinct
as
will
all
the
anterior
traces
which
father
madeleine
might
have
left
elsewhere
he
seemed
to
know
and
he
sometimes
said
in
covert
words
that
some
one
had
gleaned
certain
information
in
a
certain
district
about
a
family
which
had
disappeared
once
he
chanced
to
say
as
he
was
talking
to
himself
i
think
i
have
him
then
he
remained
pensive
for
three
days
and
uttered
not
a
word
it
seemed
that
the
thread
which
he
thought
he
held
had
broken
moreover
and
this
furnishes
the
necessary
corrective
for
the
too
absolute
sense
which
certain
words
might
present
there
can
be
nothing
really
infallible
in
a
human
creature
and
the
peculiarity
of
instinct
is
that
it
can
become
confused
thrown
off
the
track
and
defeated
otherwise
it
would
be
superior
to
intelligence
and
the
beast
would
be
found
to
be
provided
with
a
better
light
than
man
javert
was
evidently
somewhat
disconcerted
by
the
perfect
naturalness
and
tranquillity
of
m
madeleine
one
day
nevertheless
his
strange
manner
appeared
to
produce
an
impression
on
m
madeleine
it
was
on
the
following
occasion
chapter
vi
father
fauchelevent
one
morning
m
madeleine
was
passing
through
an
unpaved
alley
of
m
sur
m
he
heard
a
noise
and
saw
a
group
some
distance
away
he
approached
an
old
man
named
father
fauchelevent
had
just
fallen
beneath
his
cart
his
horse
having
tumbled
down
this
fauchelevent
was
one
of
the
few
enemies
whom
m
madeleine
had
at
that
time
when
madeleine
arrived
in
the
neighborhood
fauchelevent
an
ex
notary
and
a
peasant
who
was
almost
educated
had
a
business
which
was
beginning
to
be
in
a
bad
way
fauchelevent
had
seen
this
simple
workman
grow
rich
while
he
a
lawyer
was
being
ruined
this
had
filled
him
with
jealousy
and
he
had
done
all
he
could
on
every
occasion
to
injure
madeleine
then
bankruptcy
had
come
and
as
the
old
man
had
nothing
left
but
a
cart
and
a
horse
and
neither
family
nor
children
he
had
turned
carter
the
horse
had
two
broken
legs
and
could
not
rise
the
old
man
was
caught
in
the
wheels
the
fall
had
been
so
unlucky
that
the
whole
weight
of
the
vehicle
rested
on
his
breast
the
cart
was
quite
heavily
laden
father
fauchelevent
was
rattling
in
the
throat
in
the
most
lamentable
manner
they
had
tried
but
in
vain
to
drag
him
out
an
unmethodical
effort
aid
awkwardly
given
a
wrong
shake
might
kill
him
it
was
impossible
to
disengage
him
otherwise
than
by
lifting
the
vehicle
off
of
him
javert
who
had
come
up
at
the
moment
of
the
accident
had
sent
for
a
jack
screw
m
madeleine
arrived
people
stood
aside
respectfully
help
cried
old
fauchelevent
who
will
be
good
and
save
the
old
man
m
madeleine
turned
towards
those
present
is
there
a
jack
screw
to
be
had
one
has
been
sent
for
answered
the
peasant
how
long
will
it
take
to
get
it
they
have
gone
for
the
nearest
to
flachot
s
place
where
there
is
a
farrier
but
it
makes
no
difference
it
will
take
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
a
quarter
of
an
hour
exclaimed
madeleine
it
had
rained
on
the
preceding
night
the
soil
was
soaked
the
cart
was
sinking
deeper
into
the
earth
every
moment
and
crushing
the
old
carter
s
breast
more
and
more
it
was
evident
that
his
ribs
would
be
broken
in
five
minutes
more
it
is
impossible
to
wait
another
quarter
of
an
hour
said
madeleine
to
the
peasants
who
were
staring
at
him
we
must
but
it
will
be
too
late
then
don
t
you
see
that
the
cart
is
sinking
well
listen
resumed
madeleine
there
is
still
room
enough
under
the
cart
to
allow
a
man
to
crawl
beneath
it
and
raise
it
with
his
back
only
half
a
minute
and
the
poor
man
can
be
taken
out
is
there
any
one
here
who
has
stout
loins
and
heart
there
are
five
louis
d
or
to
be
earned
not
a
man
in
the
group
stirred
ten
louis
said
madeleine
the
persons
present
dropped
their
eyes
one
of
them
muttered
a
man
would
need
to
be
devilish
strong
and
then
he
runs
the
risk
of
getting
crushed
come
began
madeleine
again
twenty
louis
the
same
silence
it
is
not
the
will
which
is
lacking
said
a
voice
m
madeleine
turned
round
and
recognized
javert
he
had
not
noticed
him
on
his
arrival
javert
went
on
it
is
strength
one
would
have
to
be
a
terrible
man
to
do
such
a
thing
as
lift
a
cart
like
that
on
his
back
then
gazing
fixedly
at
m
madeleine
he
went
on
emphasizing
every
word
that
he
uttered
monsieur
madeleine
i
have
never
known
but
one
man
capable
of
doing
what
you
ask
madeleine
shuddered
javert
added
with
an
air
of
indifference
but
without
removing
his
eyes
from
madeleine
he
was
a
convict
ah
said
madeleine
in
the
galleys
at
toulon
madeleine
turned
pale
meanwhile
the
cart
continued
to
sink
slowly
father
fauchelevent
rattled
in
the
throat
and
shrieked
i
am
strangling
my
ribs
are
breaking
a
screw
something
ah
madeleine
glanced
about
him
is
there
then
no
one
who
wishes
to
earn
twenty
louis
and
save
the
life
of
this
poor
old
man
no
one
stirred
javert
resumed
i
have
never
known
but
one
man
who
could
take
the
place
of
a
screw
and
he
was
that
convict
ah
it
is
crushing
me
cried
the
old
man
madeleine
raised
his
head
met
javert
s
falcon
eye
still
fixed
upon
him
looked
at
the
motionless
peasants
and
smiled
sadly
then
without
saying
a
word
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
before
the
crowd
had
even
had
time
to
utter
a
cry
he
was
underneath
the
vehicle
a
terrible
moment
of
expectation
and
silence
ensued
they
beheld
madeleine
almost
flat
on
his
stomach
beneath
that
terrible
weight
make
two
vain
efforts
to
bring
his
knees
and
his
elbows
together
they
shouted
to
him
father
madeleine
come
out
old
fauchelevent
himself
said
to
him
monsieur
madeleine
go
away
you
see
that
i
am
fated
to
die
leave
me
you
will
get
yourself
crushed
also
madeleine
made
no
reply
all
the
spectators
were
panting
the
wheels
had
continued
to
sink
and
it
had
become
almost
impossible
for
madeleine
to
make
his
way
from
under
the
vehicle
suddenly
the
enormous
mass
was
seen
to
quiver
the
cart
rose
slowly
the
wheels
half
emerged
from
the
ruts
they
heard
a
stifled
voice
crying
make
haste
help
it
was
madeleine
who
had
just
made
a
final
effort
they
rushed
forwards
the
devotion
of
a
single
man
had
given
force
and
courage
to
all
the
cart
was
raised
by
twenty
arms
old
fauchelevent
was
saved
madeleine
rose
he
was
pale
though
dripping
with
perspiration
his
clothes
were
torn
and
covered
with
mud
all
wept
the
old
man
kissed
his
knees
and
called
him
the
good
god
as
for
him
he
bore
upon
his
countenance
an
indescribable
expression
of
happy
and
celestial
suffering
and
he
fixed
his
tranquil
eye
on
javert
who
was
still
staring
at
him
chapter

fauchelevent
becomes
a
gardener
in
paris
fauchelevent
had
dislocated
his
kneepan
in
his
fall
father
madeleine
had
him
conveyed
to
an
infirmary
which
he
had
established
for
his
workmen
in
the
factory
building
itself
and
which
was
served
by
two
sisters
of
charity
on
the
following
morning
the
old
man
found
a
thousand
franc
bank
note
on
his
night
stand
with
these
words
in
father
madeleine
s
writing
i
purchase
your
horse
and
cart
the
cart
was
broken
and
the
horse
was
dead
fauchelevent
recovered
but
his
knee
remained
stiff
m
madeleine
on
the
recommendation
of
the
sisters
of
charity
and
of
his
priest
got
the
good
man
a
place
as
gardener
in
a
female
convent
in
the
rue
saint
antoine
in
paris
some
time
afterwards
m
madeleine
was
appointed
mayor
the
first
time
that
javert
beheld
m
madeleine
clothed
in
the
scarf
which
gave
him
authority
over
the
town
he
felt
the
sort
of
shudder
which
a
watch
dog
might
experience
on
smelling
a
wolf
in
his
master
s
clothes
from
that
time
forth
he
avoided
him
as
much
as
he
possibly
could
when
the
requirements
of
the
service
imperatively
demanded
it
and
he
could
not
do
otherwise
than
meet
the
mayor
he
addressed
him
with
profound
respect
this
prosperity
created
at
m
sur
m
by
father
madeleine
had
besides
the
visible
signs
which
we
have
mentioned
another
symptom
which
was
none
the
less
significant
for
not
being
visible
this
never
deceives
when
the
population
suffers
when
work
is
lacking
when
there
is
no
commerce
the
tax
payer
resists
imposts
through
penury
he
exhausts
and
oversteps
his
respite
and
the
state
expends
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
charges
for
compelling
and
collection
when
work
is
abundant
when
the
country
is
rich
and
happy
the
taxes
are
paid
easily
and
cost
the
state
nothing
it
may
be
said
that
there
is
one
infallible
thermometer
of
the
public
misery
and
riches
the
cost
of
collecting
the
taxes
in
the
course
of
seven
years
the
expense
of
collecting
the
taxes
had
diminished
three
fourths
in
the
arrondissement
of
m
sur
m
and
this
led
to
this
arrondissement
being
frequently
cited
from
all
the
rest
by
m
de
villele
then
minister
of
finance
such
was
the
condition
of
the
country
when
fantine
returned
thither
no
one
remembered
her
fortunately
the
door
of
m
madeleine
s
factory
was
like
the
face
of
a
friend
she
presented
herself
there
and
was
admitted
to
the
women
s
workroom
the
trade
was
entirely
new
to
fantine
she
could
not
be
very
skilful
at
it
and
she
therefore
earned
but
little
by
her
day
s
work
but
it
was
sufficient
the
problem
was
solved
she
was
earning
her
living

madame

expends
thirty

on

when
fantine
saw
that
she
was
making
her
living
she
felt
joyful
for
a
moment
to
live
honestly
by
her
own
labor
what
mercy
from
heaven
the
taste
for
work
had
really
returned
to
her
she
bought
a
looking
glass
took
pleasure
in
surveying
in
it
her
youth
her
beautiful
hair
her
fine
teeth
she
forgot
many
things
she
thought
only
of
cosette
and
of
the
possible
future
and
was
almost
happy
she
hired
a
little
room
and
furnished
on
credit
on
the
strength
of
her
future
work
a
lingering
trace
of
her
improvident
ways
as
she
was
not
able
to
say
that
she
was
married
she
took
good
care
as
we
have
seen
not
to
mention
her
little
girl
at
first
as
the
reader
has
seen
she
paid
the
thenardiers
promptly
as
she
only
knew
how
to
sign
her
name
she
was
obliged
to
write
through
a
public
letter
writer
she
wrote
often
and
this
was
noticed
it
began
to
be
said
in
an
undertone
in
the
women
s
workroom
that
fantine
wrote
letters
and
that
she
had
ways
about
her
there
is
no
one
for
spying
on
people
s
actions
like
those
who
are
not
concerned
in
them
why
does
that
gentleman
never
come
except
at
nightfall
why
does
mr
so
and
so
never
hang
his
key
on
its
nail
on
tuesday
why
does
he
always
take
the
narrow
streets
why
does
madame
always
descend
from
her
hackney
coach
before
reaching
her
house
why
does
she
send
out
to
purchase
six
sheets
of
note
paper
when
she
has
a
whole
stationer
s
shop
full
of
it
etc
there
exist
beings
who
for
the
sake
of
obtaining
the
key
to
these
enigmas
which
are
moreover
of
no
consequence
whatever
to
them
spend
more
money
waste
more
time
take
more
trouble
than
would
be
required
for
ten
good
actions
and
that
gratuitously
for
their
own
pleasure
without
receiving
any
other
payment
for
their
curiosity
than
curiosity
they
will
follow
up
such
and
such
a
man
or
woman
for
whole
days
they
will
do
sentry
duty
for
hours
at
a
time
on
the
corners
of
the
streets
under
alley
way
doors
at
night
in
cold
and
rain
they
will
bribe
errand
porters
they
will
make
the
drivers
of
hackney
coaches
and
lackeys
tipsy
buy
a
waiting
maid
suborn
a
porter
why
for
no
reason
a
pure
passion
for
seeing
knowing
and
penetrating
into
things
a
pure
itch
for
talking
and
often
these
secrets
once
known
these
mysteries
made
public
these
enigmas
illuminated
by
the
light
of
day
bring
on
catastrophies
duels
failures
the
ruin
of
families
and
broken
lives
to
the
great
joy
of
those
who
have
found
out
everything
without
any
interest
in
the
matter
and
by
pure
instinct
a
sad
thing
certain
persons
are
malicious
solely
through
a
necessity
for
talking
their
conversation
the
chat
of
the
drawing
room
gossip
of
the
anteroom
is
like
those
chimneys
which
consume
wood
rapidly
they
need
a
great
amount
of
combustibles
and
their
combustibles
are
furnished
by
their
neighbors
so
fantine
was
watched
in
addition
many
a
one
was
jealous
of
her
golden
hair
and
of
her
white
teeth
it
was
remarked
that
in
the
workroom
she
often
turned
aside
in
the
midst
of
the
rest
to
wipe
away
a
tear
these
were
the
moments
when
she
was
thinking
of
her
child
perhaps
also
of
the
man
whom
she
had
loved
breaking
the
gloomy
bonds
of
the
past
is
a
mournful
task
it
was
observed
that
she
wrote
twice
a
month
at
least
and
that
she
paid
the
carriage
on
the
letter
they
managed
to
obtain
the
address
monsieur
monsieur
thenardier
inn
keeper
at
montfermeil
the
public
writer
a
good
old
man
who
could
not
fill
his
stomach
with
red
wine
without
emptying
his
pocket
of
secrets
was
made
to
talk
in
the
wine
shop
in
short
it
was
discovered
that
fantine
had
a
child
she
must
be
a
pretty
sort
of
a
woman
an
old
gossip
was
found
who
made
the
trip
to
montfermeil
talked
to
the
thenardiers
and
said
on
her
return
for
my
five
and
thirty
francs
i
have
freed
my
mind
i
have
seen
the
child
the
gossip
who
did
this
thing
was
a
gorgon
named
madame
victurnien
the
guardian
and
door
keeper
of
every
one
s
virtue
madame
victurnien
was
fifty
six
and
re
enforced
the
mask
of
ugliness
with
the
mask
of
age
a
quavering
voice
a
whimsical
mind
this
old
dame
had
once
been
young
astonishing
fact
in
her
youth
in
93
she
had
married
a
monk
who
had
fled
from
his
cloister
in
a
red
cap
and
passed
from
the
bernardines
to
the
jacobins
she
was
dry
rough
peevish
sharp
captious
almost
venomous
all
this
in
memory
of
her
monk
whose
widow
she
was
and
who
had
ruled
over
her
masterfully
and
bent
her
to
his
will
she
was
a
nettle
in
which
the
rustle
of
the
cassock
was
visible
at
the
restoration
she
had
turned
bigot
and
that
with
so
much
energy
that
the
priests
had
forgiven
her
her
monk
she
had
a
small
property
which
she
bequeathed
with
much
ostentation
to
a
religious
community
she
was
in
high
favor
at
the
episcopal
palace
of
arras
so
this
madame
victurnien
went
to
montfermeil
and
returned
with
the
remark
i
have
seen
the
child
all
this
took
time
fantine
had
been
at
the
factory
for
more
than
a
year
when
one
morning
the
superintendent
of
the
workroom
handed
her
fifty
francs
from
the
mayor
told
her
that
she
was
no
longer
employed
in
the
shop
and
requested
her
in
the
mayor
s
name
to
leave
the
neighborhood
this
was
the
very
month
when
the
thenardiers
after
having
demanded
twelve
francs
instead
of
six
had
just
exacted
fifteen
francs
instead
of
twelve
fantine
was
overwhelmed
she
could
not
leave
the
neighborhood
she
was
in
debt
for
her
rent
and
furniture
fifty
francs
was
not
sufficient
to
cancel
this
debt
she
stammered
a
few
supplicating
words
the
superintendent
ordered
her
to
leave
the
shop
on
the
instant
besides
fantine
was
only
a
moderately
good
workwoman
overcome
with
shame
even
more
than
with
despair
she
quitted
the
shop
and
returned
to
her
room
so
her
fault
was
now
known
to
every
one
she
no
longer
felt
strong
enough
to
say
a
word
she
was
advised
to
see
the
mayor
she
did
not
dare
the
mayor
had
given
her
fifty
francs
because
he
was
good
and
had
dismissed
her
because
he
was
just
she
bowed
before
the
decision
chapter
ix
madame
victurnien
s

so
the
monk
s
widow
was
good
for
something
but
m
madeleine
had
heard
nothing
of
all
this
life
is
full
of
just
such
combinations
of
events
m
madeleine
was
in
the
habit
of
almost
never
entering
the
women
s
workroom
at
the
head
of
this
room
he
had
placed
an
elderly
spinster
whom
the
priest
had
provided
for
him
and
he
had
full
confidence
in
this
superintendent
a
truly
respectable
person

full
of
the
charity

consists

not

and
in

wholly
on
her
the
best
men
are
often
obliged
to
delegate
their
authority
it
was
with
this
full
power
and
the
conviction
that
she
was
doing
right
that
the
superintendent
had
instituted
the
suit
judged
condemned
and
executed
fantine
as
regards
the
fifty
francs
she
had
given
them
from
a
fund
which
m
madeleine
had
intrusted
to
her
for
charitable
purposes
and
for
giving
assistance
to
the
workwomen
and
of
which
she
rendered
no
account
fantine
tried
to
obtain
a
situation
as
a
servant
in
the
neighborhood
she
went
from
house
to

no

would
have
her
she
could
not
leave

the

to

she

if
you

have
you
arrested

the
householder
whom
she
owed
for
her
rent
said
to
her
you
are
young
and
pretty
you
can

she
divided
the
fifty
francs
between
the
landlord
and
the
furniture
dealer
returned
to
the
latter
three
quarters
of
his
goods
kept
only
necessaries
and
found
herself
without
work
without
a
trade
with
nothing
but
her
bed
and
still
about
fifty
francs
in
debt
she
began
to
make
coarse
shirts
for
soldiers
of
the
garrison
and
earned
twelve
sous
a
day
her
daughter
cost
her
ten
it
was
at
this
point
that
she
began
to
pay
the
thenardiers
irregularly
however
the
old
woman
who
lighted
her
candle
for
her
when
she
returned
at
night
taught
her
the
art
of
living
in
misery
back
of
living
on

is
the
living
on

these
are

how
to
live

which

that
certain

creatures
who
have
grown

in
privation
and
honesty
can
get
out
of
a
sou
it
ends
by
being
a

fantine
acquired
this
sublime
talent
and
regained
a
little
courage
at
this
epoch
she
said
to
a
neighbor
bah
i
say
to
myself
by
only
sleeping
five
hours
and
working
all
the
rest
of
the

at

thought
of
having
her
come

what
then
make
her
share
her
own

and
then
she
was
in
debt
to
the

how
could
she
pay
them
and

how
pay
for
that
the
old
woman
who
had
given
her
lessons
in
what
may
be
called
the

was
a
sainted
spinster
named
marguerite
who
was
pious
with
a
true
piety
poor
and
charitable
towards
the
poor
and
even
towards

how
to

been
so
ashamed
that
she
had
not
dared
to
go
out
when
she
was
in

street
she
divined
that
people
turned
round
behind
her
and
pointed
at
her
every
one
stared
at
her
and
no
one
greeted
her
the
cold
and
bitter
scorn
of
the
passers
by
penetrated
her
very
flesh
and
soul
like
a
north
wind
it
seems
as
though
an
unfortunate
woman
were
utterly
bare
beneath
the
sarcasm
and
the
curiosity
of
all
in
small

in

at

no

knows
you
and
this
obscurity
is
a
garment
oh
how
she
would
have
liked
to
betake
herself
to
paris
impossible
she
was
obliged
to
accustom
herself
to
disrepute
as
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
indigence
gradually
she
decided
on
her
course
at
the
expiration
of
two
or
three
months
she
shook
off
her
shame
and
began
to
go
about
as
though
there
were
nothing
the
matter
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
she
said
she
went
and
came
bearing
her
head
well
up
with
a
bitter
smile

was

she
was

how

when
she
combed
her
beautiful
hair
in
the

with

and
it

about

that

that

and

in

she
went
into

by

repeating
to

came
to

laughing
and
singing
in
this
fashion
said
there
s
a
girl
who
will
come
to
a
bad
end
she
took
a
lover
the
first
who
offered
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
out
of
bravado
and
with
rage
in
her
heart
he
was
a
miserable
scamp
a
sort
of
mendicant
musician
a
lazy
beggar
who
beat
her
and
who
abandoned
her
as
she
had
taken
him
in
disgust
she
adored
her
child
the
lower
she
descended
the
darker
everything
grew
about
her
the
more
radiant
shone
that
little
angel
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
said
when
i
get
rich
i
will
have
my
cosette
with
me
and
she
laughed
her
cough
did
not
leave
her
and
she
had
sweats
on
her
back
one
day
she
received
from
the
thenardiers
a
letter
couched
in
the
following
terms
cosette
is
ill
with
a
malady
which
is
going
the
rounds
of
the
neighborhood
a
miliary
fever
they
call
it
expensive
drugs
are
required
this
is
ruining
us
and
we
can
no
longer
pay
for
them
if
you
do
not
send
us
forty
francs
before
the
week
is
out
the
little
one
will
be
dead
she
burst
out
laughing
and
said
to
her
old
neighbor
ah
they
are
good
forty
francs
the
idea
that
makes
two
napoleons
where
do
they
think
i
am
to
get
them
these
peasants
are
stupid
truly
nevertheless
she
went
to
a
dormer
window
in
the
staircase
and
read
the
letter
once
more
then
she
descended
the
stairs
and
emerged
running
and
leaping
and
still
laughing
some
one
met
her
and
said
to
her
what
makes
you
so
gay
she
replied
a
fine
piece
of
stupidity
that
some
country
people
have
written
to
me
they
demand
forty
francs
of
me
so
much
for
you
you
peasants
as
she
crossed
the
square
she
saw
a
great
many
people
collected
around
a
carriage
of
eccentric
shape
upon
the
top
of
which
stood
a
man
dressed
in
red
who
was
holding
forth
he
was
a
quack
dentist
on
his
rounds
who
was
offering
to
the
public
full
sets
of
teeth
opiates
powders
and
elixirs
fantine
mingled
in
the
group
and
began
to
laugh
with
the
rest
at
the
harangue
which
contained
slang
for
the
populace
and
jargon
for
respectable
people
the
tooth
puller
espied
the
lovely
laughing
girl
and
suddenly
exclaimed
you
have
beautiful
teeth
you
girl
there
who
are
laughing
if
you
want
to
sell
me
your
palettes
i
will
give
you
a
gold
napoleon
apiece
for
them
what
are
my
palettes
asked
fantine
the
palettes
replied
the
dental
professor
are
the
front
teeth
the
two
upper
ones
how
horrible
exclaimed
fantine
two
napoleons
grumbled
a
toothless
old
woman
who
was
present
here
s
a
lucky
girl
fantine
fled
and
stopped
her
ears
that
she
might
not
hear
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
man
shouting
to
her
reflect
my
beauty
two
napoleons
they
may
prove
of
service
if
your
heart
bids
you
come
this
evening
to
the
inn
of
the
tillac
d
argent
you
will
find
me
there
fantine
returned
home
she
was
furious
and
related
the
occurrence
to
her
good
neighbor
marguerite
can
you
understand
such
a
thing
is
he
not
an
abominable
man
how
can
they
allow
such
people
to
go
about
the
country
pull
out
my
two
front
teeth
why
i
should
be
horrible
my
hair
will
grow
again
but
my
teeth
ah
what
a
monster
of
a
man
i
should
prefer
to
throw
myself
head
first
on
the
pavement
from
the
fifth
story
he
told
me
that
he
should
be
at
the
tillac
d
argent
this
evening
and
what
did
he
offer
asked
marguerite
two
napoleons
that
makes
forty
francs
yes
said
fantine
that
makes
forty
francs
she
remained
thoughtful
and
began
her
work
at
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
left
her
sewing
and
went
to
read
the
thenardiers
letter
once
more
on
the
staircase
on
her
return
she
said
to
marguerite
who
was
at
work
beside
her
what
is
a
miliary
fever
do
you
know
yes
answered
the
old
spinster
it
is
a
disease
does
it
require
many
drugs
oh
terrible
drugs
how
does
one
get
it
it
is
a
malady
that
one
gets
without
knowing
how
then
it
attacks
children
children
in
particular
do
people
die
of
it
they
may
said
marguerite
fantine
left
the
room
and
went
to
read
her
letter
once
more
on
the
staircase
that
evening
she
went
out
and
was
seen
to
turn
her
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
rue
de
paris
where
the
inns
are
situated
the
next
morning
when
marguerite
entered
fantine
s
room
before
daylight
for
they
always
worked
together
and
in
this
manner
used
only
one
candle
for
the
two
she
found
fantine
seated
on
her
bed
pale
and
frozen
she
had
not
lain
down
her
cap
had
fallen
on
her
knees
her
candle
had
burned
all
night
and
was
almost
entirely
consumed
marguerite
halted
on
the
threshold
petrified
at
this
tremendous
wastefulness
and
exclaimed
lord
the
candle
is
all
burned
out
something
has
happened
then
she
looked
at
fantine
who
turned
toward
her
her
head
bereft
of
its
hair
fantine
had
grown
ten
years
older
since
the
preceding
night
jesus
said
marguerite
what
is
the
matter
with
you
fantine
nothing
replied
fantine
quite
the
contrary
my
child
will
not
die
of
that
frightful
malady
for
lack
of
succor
i
am
content
so
saying
she
pointed
out
to
the
spinster
two
napoleons
which
were
glittering
on
the
table
ah
jesus
god
cried
marguerite
why
it
is
a
fortune
where
did
you
get
those
louis
d
or
i
got
them
replied
fantine
at
the
same
time
she
smiled
the
candle
illuminated
her
countenance
it
was
a
bloody
smile
a
reddish
saliva
soiled
the
corners
of
her
lips
and
she
had
a
black
hole
in
her
mouth
the
two
teeth
had
been
extracted
she
sent
the
forty
francs
to
montfermeil
after
all
it
was
a
ruse
of
the
thenardiers
to
obtain
money
cosette
was
not
ill
fantine
threw
her
mirror
out
of
the
window
she
had
long
since
quitted
her
cell
on
the
second
floor
for
an
attic
with
only
a
latch
to
fasten
it
next
the
roof
one
of
those
attics
whose
extremity
forms
an
angle
with
the
floor
and
knocks
you
on
the
head
every
instant
the
poor
occupant
can
reach
the
end
of
his
chamber
as
he
can
the
end
of
his
destiny
only
by
bending
over
more
and
more
she
had
no
longer
a
bed
a
rag
which
she
called
her
coverlet
a
mattress
on
the
floor
and
a
seatless
chair
still
remained
a
little
rosebush
which
she
had
had
dried
up
forgotten
in
one
corner
in
the
other
corner
was
a
butter
pot
to
hold
water
which
froze
in
winter
and
in
which
the
various
levels
of
the
water
remained
long
marked
by
these
circles
of
ice
she
had
lost
her
shame
she
lost
her
coquetry
a
final
sign
she
went
out
with
dirty
caps
whether
from
lack
of
time
or
from
indifference
she
no
longer
mended
her
linen
as
the
heels
wore
out
she
dragged
her
stockings
down
into
her
shoes
this
was
evident
from
the
perpendicular
wrinkles
she
patched
her
bodice
which
was
old
and
worn
out
with
scraps
of
calico
which
tore
at
the
slightest
movement
the
people
to
whom
she
was
indebted
made
scenes
and
gave
her
no
peace
she
found
them
in
the
street
she
found
them
again
on
her
staircase
she
passed
many
a
night
weeping
and
thinking
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
she
felt
a
steady
pain
in
her
shoulder
towards
the
top
of
the
left
shoulder
blade
she
coughed
a
great
deal
she
deeply
hated
father
madeleine
but
made
no
complaint
she
sewed
seventeen
hours
a
day
but
a
contractor
for
the
work
of
prisons
who
made
the
prisoners
work
at
a
discount
suddenly
made
prices
fall
which
reduced
the
daily
earnings
of
working
women
to
nine
sous
seventeen
hours
of
toil
and
nine
sous
a
day
her
creditors
were
more
pitiless
than
ever
the
second
hand
dealer
who
had
taken
back
nearly
all
his
furniture
said
to
her
incessantly
when
will
you
pay
me
you
hussy
what
did
they
want
of
her
good
god
she
felt
that
she
was
being
hunted
and
something
of
the
wild
beast
developed
in
her
about
the
same
time
thenardier
wrote
to
her
that
he
had
waited
with
decidedly
too
much
amiability
and
that
he
must
have
a
hundred
francs
at
once
otherwise
he
would
turn
little
cosette
out
of
doors
convalescent
as
she
was
from
her
heavy
illness
into
the
cold
and
the
streets
and
that
she
might
do
what
she
liked
with
herself
and
die
if
she
chose
a
hundred
francs
thought
fantine
but
in
what
trade
can
one
earn
a
hundred
sous
a
day
come
said
she
let
us
sell
what
is
left
the
unfortunate
girl

chapter
xi

what
is
this
history
of
fantine
it
is
society
purchasing
a
slave
from
whom
from
misery
from
hunger
cold
isolation
destitution
a
dolorous
bargain
a
soul
for
a
morsel
of
bread
misery
offers
society
accepts
the
sacred
law
of
jesus
christ
governs
our
civilization
but
it
does
not
as
yet
permeate
it
it
is
said
that
slavery
has
disappeared
from
european
civilization
this
is
a
mistake
it
still
exists
but
it
weighs
only
upon
the
woman
and
it
is
called
prostitution
it
weighs
upon
the
woman
that
is
to
say
upon
grace
weakness
beauty
maternity
this
is
not
one
of
the
least
of
man
s
disgraces
at
the
point
in
this
melancholy
drama
which
we
have
now
reached
nothing
is
left
to
fantine
of
that
which
she
had
formerly
been
she
has
become
marble
in
becoming
mire
whoever
touches
her
feels
cold
she
passes
she
endures
you
she
ignores
you
she
is
the
severe
and
dishonored
figure
life
and
the
social
order
have
said
their
last
word
for
her
all
has
happened
to
her
that
will
happen
to
her
she
has
felt
everything
borne
everything
experienced
everything
suffered
everything
lost
everything
mourned
everything
she
is
resigned
with
that
resignation
which
resembles
indifference
as
death
resembles
sleep
she
no
longer
avoids
anything
let
all
the
clouds
fall
upon
her
and
all
the
ocean
sweep
over
her
what
matters
it
to
her
she
is
a
sponge
that
is
soaked
at
least
she
believes
it
to
be
so
but
it
is
an
error
to
imagine
that
fate
can
be
exhausted
and
that
one
has
reached
the
bottom
of
anything
whatever
alas
what
are
all
these
fates
driven
on

whither
are
they
going

which

towards

of

on
a
snowy
evening
one
of
these
dandies
one
of
these
unemployed
a
right
thinker
for
he
wore
a
morillo
and
was
moreover
warmly
enveloped
in
one
of
those
large
cloaks
which
completed
the
fashionable
costume
in
cold
weather
was
amusing
himself
by
tormenting
a
creature
who
was
prowling
about
in
a
ball
dress
with
neck
uncovered
and
flowers
in
her
hair
in
front
of
the
officers
cafe
this
dandy
was
smoking
for
he
was
decidedly
fashionable
each
time
that
the
woman
passed
in
front
of
him
he
bestowed
on
her
together
with
a
puff
from
his
cigar
some
apostrophe
which
he
considered
witty
and
mirthful
such
as
how
ugly
you
are
will
you
get
out
of
my
sight
you
have
no
teeth

this
gentleman
was
known
as

the
woman
a
melancholy
decorated
spectre
which
went
and
came
through
the
snow
made
him
no
reply
did
not
even
glance
at
him
and
nevertheless
continued
her
promenade
in
silence
and
with
a
sombre
regularity
which
brought
her
every
five
minutes
within
reach
of
this
sarcasm
like
the
condemned
soldier
who
returns
under
the
rods
the
small
effect
which
he
produced
no
doubt
piqued
the
lounger
and
taking
advantage
of
a
moment
when
her
back
was
turned
he
crept
up
behind
her
with
the
gait
of
a
wolf
and
stifling
his
laugh
bent
down
picked
up
a
handful
of
snow
from
the
pavement
and
thrust
it
abruptly
into
her
back
between
her
bare
shoulders
the
woman
uttered
a
roar
whirled
round
gave
a
leap
like
a
panther
and
hurled
herself
upon
the
man
burying
her
nails
in
his
face
with
the
most
frightful
words
which
could
fall
from
the
guard
room
into
the
gutter
these
insults
poured
forth
in
a
voice
roughened
by
brandy
did
indeed
proceed
in
hideous
wise
from
a
mouth
which
lacked
its
two
front
teeth
it
was
fantine
at
the
noise
thus
produced
the
officers
ran
out
in
throngs
from
the
cafe
passers
by
collected
and
a
large
and
merry
circle
hooting
and
applauding
was
formed
around
this
whirlwind
composed
of
two
beings
whom
there
was
some
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
a
man
and
a
woman

man
struggling
his
hat
on
the
ground
the
woman
striking
out
with
feet
and
fists
bareheaded
howling
minus
hair
and
teeth
livid
with
wrath
horrible
suddenly
a
man
of
lofty
stature
emerged
vivaciously
from
the
crowd
seized
the
woman
by
her
satin
bodice
which
was
covered
with
mud
and
said
to
her
follow
me
the
woman
raised
her
head
her
furious
voice
suddenly
died
away
her
eyes
were
glassy
she
turned
pale
instead
of
livid
and
she
trembled
with
a
quiver
of
terror
she
had
recognized
javert
the
dandy
took
advantage
of
the
incident
to
make
his
escape
chapter
xiii
the
solution
of
some
questions
connected
with
the
municipal
police
javert
thrust
aside
the
spectators
broke
the
circle
and
set
out
with
long
strides
towards
the
police
station
which
is
situated
at
the
extremity
of
the
square
dragging
the
wretched
woman
after
him
she
yielded
mechanically
neither
he
nor
she
uttered
a
word
the
cloud
of
spectators
followed
jesting
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
supreme
misery
an
occasion
for
obscenity
on
arriving
at
the
police
station
which
was
a
low
room
warmed
by
a
stove
with
a
glazed
and
grated
door
opening
on
the
street
and
guarded
by
a
detachment
javert
opened
the
door
entered
with
fantine
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
to
the
great
disappointment
of
the
curious
who
raised
themselves
on
tiptoe
and
craned
their
necks
in
front
of
the
thick
glass
of
the
station
house
in
their
effort
to
see
curiosity
is
a
sort
of
gluttony
to
see
is
to
devour
on
entering
fantine
fell
down
in
a
corner
motionless
and
mute
crouching
down
like
a
terrified
dog
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
brought
a
lighted
candle
to
the
table
javert
seated
himself
drew
a
sheet
of
stamped
paper
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
write
this
class
of
women
is
consigned
by
our
laws
entirely
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
the
latter
do
what
they
please
punish
them
as
seems
good
to
them
and
confiscate
at
their
will
those
two
sorry
things
which
they
entitle
their
industry
and
their
liberty
javert
was
impassive
his
grave
face
betrayed
no
emotion
whatever
nevertheless
he
was
seriously
and
deeply
preoccupied
it
was
one
of
those
moments
when
he
was
exercising
without
control
but
subject
to
all
the
scruples
of
a
severe
conscience
his
redoubtable
discretionary
power
at
that
moment
he
was
conscious
that
his
police
agent
s
stool
was
a
tribunal
he
was
entering
judgment
he
judged
and
condemned
he
summoned
all
the
ideas
which
could
possibly
exist
in
his
mind
around
the
great
thing
which
he
was
doing
the
more
he
examined
the
deed
of
this
woman
the
more
shocked
he
felt
it
was
evident
that
he
had
just
witnessed
the
commission
of
a
crime
he
had
just
beheld
yonder
in
the
street
society
in
the
person
of
a
freeholder
and
an
elector
insulted
and
attacked
by
a
creature
who
was
outside
all
pales
a
prostitute
had
made
an
attempt
on
the
life
of
a
citizen
he
had
seen
that
he
javert
he
wrote
in
silence
when
he
had
finished
he
signed
the
paper
folded
it
and
said
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
as
he
handed
it
to
him
take
three
men
and
conduct
this
creature
to
jail
then
turning
to
fantine
you
are
to
have
six
months
of
it
the
unhappy
woman
shuddered
six
months
six
months
of
prison
she
exclaimed
six
months
in
which
to
earn
seven
sous
a
day
but
what
will
become
of
cosette
my
daughter
my
daughter
but
i
still
owe
the
thenardiers
over
a
hundred
francs
do
you
know
that
monsieur
inspector
she
dragged
herself
across
the
damp
floor
among
the
muddy
boots
of
all
those
men
without
rising
with
clasped
hands
and
taking
great
strides
on
her
knees
monsieur
javert
said
she
i
beseech
your
mercy
i
assure
you
that
i
was
not
in
the
wrong
if
you
had
seen
the
beginning
you
would
have
seen
i
swear
to
you
by
the
good
god
that
i
was
not
to
blame
that
gentleman
the
bourgeois
whom
i
do
not
know
put
snow
in
my
back
has
any
one
the
right
to
put
snow
down
our
backs
when
we
are
walking
along
peaceably
and
doing
no
harm
to
any
one
i
am
rather
ill
as
you
see
and
then
he
had
been
saying
impertinent
things
to
me
for
a
long
time
you
are
ugly
you
have
no
teeth
i
know
well
that
i
have
no
longer
those
teeth
i
did
nothing
i
said
to
myself
the
gentleman
is
amusing
himself
i
was
honest
with
him
i
did
not
speak
to
him
it
was
at
that
moment
that
he
put
the
snow
down
my
back
monsieur
javert
good
monsieur
inspector
is
there
not
some
person
here
who
saw
it
and
can
tell
you
that
this
is
quite
true
perhaps
i
did
wrong
to
get
angry
you
know
that
one
is
not
master
of
one
s
self
at
the
first
moment
one
gives
way
to
vivacity
and
then
when
some
one
puts
something
cold
down
your
back
just
when
you
are
not
expecting
it
i
did
wrong
to
spoil
that
gentleman
s
hat
why
did
he
go
away
i
would
ask
his
pardon
oh
my
god
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
i
ask
his
pardon
do
me
the
favor
to
day
for
this
once
monsieur
javert
hold
you
do
not
know
that
in
prison
one
can
earn
only
seven
sous
a
day
it
is
not
the
government
s
fault
but
seven
sous
is
one
s
earnings
and
just
fancy
i
must
pay
one
hundred
francs
or
my
little
girl
will
be
sent
to
me
oh
my
god
i
cannot
have
her
with
me
what
i
do
is
so
vile
oh
my
cosette
oh
my
little
angel
of
the
holy
virgin
what
will
become
of
her
poor
creature
i
will
tell
you
it
is
the
thenardiers
inn
keepers
peasants
and
such
people
are
unreasonable
they
want
money
don
t
put
me
in
prison
you
see
there
is
a
little
girl
who
will
be
turned
out
into
the
street
to
get
along
as
best
she
may
in
the
very
heart
of
the
winter
and
you
must
have
pity
on
such
a
being
my
good
monsieur
javert
if
she
were
older
she
might
earn
her
living
but
it
cannot
be
done
at
that
age
i
am
not
a
bad
woman
at
bottom
it
is
not
cowardliness
and
gluttony
that
have
made
me
what
i
am
if
i
have
drunk
brandy
it
was
out
of
misery
i
do
not
love
it
but
it
benumbs
the
senses
when
i
was
happy
it
was
only
necessary
to
glance
into
my
closets
and
it
would
have
been
evident
that
i
was
not
a
coquettish
and
untidy
woman
i
had
linen
a
great
deal
of
linen
have
pity
on
me
monsieur
javert
she
spoke
thus
rent
in
twain
shaken
with
sobs
blinded
with
tears
her
neck
bare
wringing
her
hands
and
coughing
with
a
dry
short
cough
stammering
softly
with
a
voice
of
agony
great
sorrow
is
a
divine
and
terrible
ray
which
transfigures
the
unhappy
at
that
moment
fantine
had
become
beautiful
once
more
from
time
to
time
she
paused
and
tenderly
kissed
the
police
agent
s
coat
she
would
have
softened
a
heart
of
granite
but
a
heart
of
wood
cannot
be
softened
come
said
javert
i
have
heard
you
out
have
you
entirely
finished
you
will
get
six
months
now
march
the
eternal
father
in
person
could
do
nothing
more
at
these
solemn
words
the
eternal
father
in
person
could
do
nothing
more
she
understood
that
her
fate
was
sealed
she
sank
down
murmuring
mercy
javert
turned
his
back
the
soldiers
seized
her
by
the
arms
a
few
moments
earlier
a
man
had
entered
but
no
one
had
paid
any
heed
to
him
he
shut
the
door
leaned
his
back
against
it
and
listened
to
fantine
s
despairing
supplications
at
the
instant
when
the
soldiers
laid
their
hands
upon
the
unfortunate
woman
who
would
not
rise
he
emerged
from
the
shadow
and
said
one
moment
if
you
please
javert
raised
his
eyes
and
recognized
m
madeleine
he
removed
his
hat
and
saluting
him
with
a
sort
of
aggrieved
awkwardness
excuse
me
mr
mayor
the
words
mr
mayor
produced
a
curious
effect
upon
fantine
she
rose
to
her
feet
with
one
bound
like
a
spectre
springing
from
the
earth
thrust
aside
the
soldiers
with
both
arms
walked
straight
up
to
m
madeleine
before
any
one
could
prevent
her
and
gazing
intently
at
him
with
a
bewildered
air
she
cried
ah
so
it
is
you
who
are
m
le
maire
then
she
burst
into
a
laugh
and
spit
in
his
face
m
madeleine
wiped
his
face
and
said
inspector
javert
set
this
woman
at
liberty
javert
felt
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
going
mad
he
experienced
at
that
moment
blow
upon
blow
and
almost
simultaneously
the
most
violent
emotions
which
he
had
ever
undergone
in
all
his
life
to
see
a
woman
of
the
town
spit
in
the
mayor
s
face
was
a
thing
so
monstrous
that
in
his
most
daring
flights
of
fancy
he
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
sacrilege
to
believe
it
possible
on
the
other
hand
at
the
very
bottom
of
his
thought
he
made
a
hideous
comparison
as
to
what
this
woman
was
and
as
to
what
this
mayor
might
be
and
then
he
with
horror
caught
a
glimpse
of
i
know
not
what
simple
explanation
of
this
prodigious
attack
but
when
he
beheld
that
mayor
that
magistrate
calmly
wipe
his
face
and
say
set
this
woman
at
liberty
he
underwent
a
sort
of
intoxication
of
amazement
thought
and
word
failed
him
equally
the
sum
total
of
possible
astonishment
had
been
exceeded
in
his
case
he
remained
mute
the
words
had
produced
no
less
strange
an
effect
on
fantine
she
raised
her
bare
arm
and
clung
to
the
damper
of
the
stove
like
a
person
who
is
reeling
nevertheless
she
glanced
about
her
and
began
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
as
though
talking
to
herself
at
liberty
i
am
to
be
allowed
to
go
i
am
not
to
go
to
prison
for
six
months
who
said
that
it
is
not
possible
that
any
one
could
have
said
that
i
did
not
hear
aright
it
cannot
have
been
that
monster
of
a
mayor
was
it
you
my
good
monsieur
javert
who
said
that
i
was
to
be
set
free
oh
see
here
i
will
tell
you
about
it
and
you
will
let
me
go
that
monster
of
a
mayor
that
old
blackguard
of
a
mayor
is
the
cause
of
all
just
imagine
monsieur
javert
he
turned
me
out
all
because
of
a
pack
of
rascally
women
who
gossip
in
the
workroom
if
that
is
not
a
horror
what
is
to
dismiss
a
poor
girl
who
is
doing
her
work
honestly
then
i
could
no
longer
earn
enough
and
all
this
misery
followed
in
the
first
place
there
is
one
improvement
which
these
gentlemen
of
the
police
ought
to
make
and
that
is
to
prevent
prison
contractors
from
wronging
poor
people
i
will
explain
it
to
you
you
see
you
are
earning
twelve
sous
at
shirt
making
the
price
falls
to
nine
sous
and
it
is
not
enough
to
live
on
then
one
has
to
become
whatever
one
can
as
for
me
i
had
my
little
cosette
and
i
was
actually
forced
to
become
a
bad
woman
now
you
understand
how
it
is
that
that
blackguard
of
a
mayor
caused
all
the
mischief
after
that
i
stamped
on
that
gentleman
s
hat
in
front
of
the
officers
cafe
but
he
had
spoiled
my
whole
dress
with
snow
we
women
have
but
one
silk
dress
for
evening
wear
you
see
that
i
did
not
do
wrong
deliberately
truly
monsieur
javert
and
everywhere
i
behold
women
who
are
far
more
wicked
than
i
and
who
are
much
happier
o
monsieur
javert
it
was
you
who
gave
orders
that
i
am
to
be
set
free
was
it
not
make
inquiries
speak
to
my
landlord
i
am
paying
my
rent
now
they
will
tell
you
that
i
am
perfectly
honest
ah
my
god
i
beg
your
pardon
i
have
unintentionally
touched
the
damper
of
the
stove
and
it
has
made
it
smoke
m
madeleine
listened
to
her
with
profound
attention
while
she
was
speaking
he
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
drew
out
his
purse
and
opened
it
it
was
empty
he
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
he
said
to
fantine
how
much
did
you
say
that
you
owed
fantine
who
was
looking
at
javert
only
turned
towards
him
was
i
speaking
to
you
then
addressing
the
soldiers
say
you
fellows
did
you
see
how
i
spit
in
his
face
ah
you
old
wretch
of
a
mayor
you
came
here
to
frighten
me
but
i
m
not
afraid
of
you
i
am
afraid
of
monsieur
javert
i
am
afraid
of
my
good
monsieur
javert
so
saying
she
turned
to
the
inspector
again
and
yet
you
see
mr
inspector
it
is
necessary
to
be
just
i
understand
that
you
are
just
mr
inspector
in
fact
it
is
perfectly
simple
a
man
amuses
himself
by
putting
snow
down
a
woman
s
back
and
that
makes
the
officers
laugh
one
must
divert
themselves
in
some
way
and
we
well
we
are
here
for
them
to
amuse
themselves
with
of
course
and
then
you
you
come
you
are
certainly
obliged
to
preserve
order
you
lead
off
the
woman
who
is
in
the
wrong
but
on
reflection
since
you
are
a
good
man
you
say
that
i
am
to
be
set
at
liberty
it
is
for
the
sake
of
the
little
one
for
six
months
in
prison
would
prevent
my
supporting
my
child
only
don
t
do
it
again
you
hussy
oh
i
won
t
do
it
again
monsieur
javert
they
may
do
whatever
they
please
to
me
now
i
will
not
stir
but
to
day
you
see
i
cried
because
it
hurt
me
i
was
not
expecting
that
snow
from
the
gentleman
at
all
and
then
as
i
told
you
i
am
not
well
i
have
a
cough
i
seem
to
have
a
burning
ball
in
my
stomach
and
the
doctor
tells
me
take
care
of
yourself
here
feel
give
me
your
hand
don
t
be
afraid
it
is
here
she
no
longer
wept
her
voice
was
caressing
she
placed
javert
s
coarse
hand
on
her
delicate
white
throat
and
looked
smilingly
at
him
all
at
once
she
rapidly
adjusted
her
disordered
garments
dropped
the
folds
of
her
skirt
which
had
been
pushed
up
as
she
dragged
herself
along
almost
to
the
height
of
her
knee
and
stepped
towards
the
door
saying
to
the
soldiers
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
friendly
nod
children
monsieur
l
inspecteur
has
said
that
i
am
to
be
released
and
i
am
going
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
one
step
more
and
she
would
be
in
the
street
javert
up
to
that
moment
had
remained
erect
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
cast
athwart
this
scene
like
some
displaced
statue
which
is
waiting
to
be
put
away
somewhere
the
sound
of
the
latch
roused
him
he
raised
his
head
with
an
expression
of
sovereign
authority
an
expression
all
the
more
alarming
in
proportion
as
the
authority
rests
on
a
low
level
ferocious
in
the
wild
beast
atrocious
in
the
man
of
no
estate
sergeant
he
cried
don
t
you
see
that
that
jade
is
walking
off
who
bade
you
let
her
go
i
said
madeleine
fantine
trembled
at
the
sound
of
javert
s
voice
and
let
go
of
the
latch
as
a
thief
relinquishes
the
article
which
he
has
stolen
at
the
sound
of
madeleine
s
voice
she
turned
around
and
from
that
moment
forth
she
uttered
no
word
nor
dared
so
much
as
to
breathe
freely
but
her
glance
strayed
from
madeleine
to
javert
and
from
javert
to
madeleine
in
turn
according
to
which
was
speaking
it
was
evident
that
javert
must
have
been
exasperated
beyond
measure
before
he
would
permit
himself
to
apostrophize
the
sergeant
as
he
had
done
after
the
mayor
s
suggestion
that
fantine
should
be
set
at
liberty
had
he
reached
the
point
of
forgetting
the
mayor
s
presence
had
he
finally
declared
to
himself
that
it
was
impossible
that
any
authority
should
have
given
such
an
order
and
that
the
mayor
must
certainly
have
said
one
thing
by
mistake
for
another
without
intending
it
or
in
view
of
the
enormities
of
which
he
had
been
a
witness
for
the
past
two
hours
did
he
say
to
himself
that
it
was
necessary
to
recur
to
supreme
resolutions
that
it
was
indispensable
that
the
small
should
be
made
great
that
the
police
spy
should
transform
himself
into
a
magistrate
that
the
policeman
should
become
a
dispenser
of
justice
and
that
in
this
prodigious
extremity
order
law
morality
government
society
in
its
entirety
was
personified
in
him
javert
however
that
may
be
when
m
madeleine
uttered
that
word
i
as
we
have
just
heard
police
inspector
javert
was
seen
to
turn
toward
the
mayor
pale
cold
with
blue
lips
and
a
look
of
despair
his
whole
body
agitated
by
an
imperceptible
quiver
and
an
unprecedented
occurrence
and
say
to
him
with
downcast
eyes
but
a
firm
voice
mr
mayor
that
cannot
be
why
not
said
m
madeleine
this
miserable
woman
has
insulted
a
citizen
inspector
javert
replied
the
mayor
in
a
calm
and
conciliating
tone
listen
you
are
an
honest
man
and
i
feel
no
hesitation
in
explaining
matters
to
you
here
is
the
true
state
of
the
case
i
was
passing
through
the
square
just
as
you
were
leading
this
woman
away
there
were
still
groups
of
people
standing
about
and
i
made
inquiries
and
learned
everything
it
was
the
townsman
who
was
in
the
wrong
and
who
should
have
been
arrested
by
properly
conducted
police
javert
retorted
this
wretch
has
just
insulted
monsieur
le
maire
that
concerns
me
said
m
madeleine
my
own
insult
belongs
to
me
i
think
i
can
do
what
i
please
about
it
i
beg
monsieur
le
maire
s
pardon
the
insult
is
not
to
him
but
to
the
law
inspector
javert
replied
m
madeleine
the
highest
law
is
conscience
i
have
heard
this
woman
i
know
what
i
am
doing
and
i
mr
mayor
do
not
know
what
i
see
then
content
yourself
with
obeying
i
am
obeying
my
duty
my
duty
demands
that
this
woman
shall
serve
six
months
in
prison
m
madeleine
replied
gently
heed
this
well
she
will
not
serve
a
single
day
at
this
decisive
word
javert
ventured
to
fix
a
searching
look
on
the
mayor
and
to
say
but
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
was
still
profoundly
respectful
i
am
sorry
to
oppose
monsieur
le
maire
it
is
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
but
he
will
permit
me
to
remark
that
i
am
within
the
bounds
of
my
authority
i
confine
myself
since
monsieur
le
maire
desires
it
to
the
question
of
the
gentleman
i
was
present
this
woman
flung
herself
on
monsieur
bamatabnois
who
is
an
elector
and
the
proprietor
of
that
handsome
house
with
a
balcony
which
forms
the
corner
of
the
esplanade
three
stories
high
and
entirely
of
cut
stone
such
things
as
there
are
in
the
world
in
any
case
monsieur
le
maire
this
is
a
question
of
police
regulations
in
the
streets
and
concerns
me
and
i
shall
detain
this
woman
fantine
then
m
madeleine
folded
his
arms
and
said
in
a
severe
voice
which
no
one
in
the
town
had
heard
hitherto
the
matter
to
which
you
refer
is
one
connected
with
the
municipal
police
according
to
the
terms
of
articles
nine
eleven
fifteen
and
sixty
six
of
the
code
of
criminal
examination
i
am
the
judge
i
order
that
this
woman
shall
be
set
at
liberty
javert
ventured
to
make
a
final
effort
but
mr
mayor
i
refer
you
to
article
eighty
one
of
the
law
of
the
13th
of
december
1799
in
regard
to
arbitrary
detention
monsieur
le
maire
permit
me
not
another
word
but
leave
the
room
said
m
madeleine
javert
received
the
blow
erect
full
in
the
face
in
his
breast
like
a
russian
soldier
he
bowed
to
the
very
earth
before
the
mayor
and
left
the
room
fantine
stood
aside
from
the
door
and
stared
at
him
in
amazement
as
he
passed
nevertheless
she
also
was
the
prey
to
a
strange
confusion
she
had
just
seen
herself
a
subject
of
dispute
between
two
opposing
powers
she
had
seen
two
men
who
held
in
their
hands
her
liberty
her
life
her
soul
her
child
in
combat
before
her
very
eyes
one
of
these
men
was
drawing
her
towards
darkness
the
other
was
leading
her
back
towards
the
light
in
this
conflict
viewed
through
the
exaggerations
of
terror
these
two
men
had
appeared
to
her
like
two
giants
the
one
spoke
like
her
demon
the
other
like
her
good
angel
the
angel
had
conquered
the
demon
and
strange
to
say
that
which
made
her
shudder
from
head
to
foot
was
the
fact
that
this
angel
this
liberator
was
the
very
man
whom
she
abhorred
that
mayor
whom
she
had
so
long
regarded
as
the
author
of
all
her
woes
that
madeleine
and
at
the
very
moment
when
she
had
insulted
him
in
so
hideous
a
fashion
he
had
saved
her
had
she
then
been
mistaken
must
she
change
her
whole
soul
she
did
not
know
she
trembled
she
listened
in
bewilderment
she
looked
on
in
affright
and
at
every
word
uttered
by
m
madeleine
she
felt
the
frightful
shades
of
hatred
crumble
and
melt
within
her
and
something
warm
and
ineffable
indescribable
which
was
both
joy
confidence
and
love
dawn
in
her
heart
when
javert
had
taken
his
departure
m
madeleine
turned
to
her
and
said
to
her
in
a
deliberate
voice
like
a
serious
man
who
does
not
wish
to
weep
and
who
finds
some
difficulty
in
speaking
i
have
heard
you
i
knew
nothing
about
what
you
have
mentioned
i
believe
that
it
is
true
and
i
feel
that
it
is
true
i
was
even
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
you
had
left
my
shop
why
did
you
not
apply
to
me
but
here
i
will
pay
your
debts
i
will
send
for
your
child
or
you
shall
go
to
her
you
shall
live
here
in
paris
or
where
you
please
i
undertake
the
care
of
your
child
and
yourself
you
shall
not
work
any
longer
if
you
do
not
like
i
will
give
all
the
money
you
require
you
shall
be
honest
and
happy
once
more
and
listen
i
declare
to
you
that
if
all
is
as
you
say
and
i
do
not
doubt
it
you
have
never
ceased
to
be
virtuous
and
holy
in
the
sight
of
god
oh
poor
woman
this
was
more
than
fantine
could
bear
to
have
cosette
to
leave
this
life
of
infamy
to
live
free
rich
happy
respectable
with
cosette
to
see
all
these
realities
of
paradise
blossom
of
a
sudden
in
the
midst
of
her
misery
she
stared
stupidly
at
this
man
who
was
talking
to
her
and
could
only
give
vent
to
two
or
three
sobs
oh
oh
oh
her
limbs
gave
way
beneath
her
she
knelt
in
front
of
m
madeleine
and
before
he
could
prevent
her
he
felt
her
grasp
his
hand
and
press
her
lips
to
it
then
she
fainted

i
the
beginning
of
repose
m
madeleine
had
fantine
removed
to
that
infirmary
which
he
had
established
in
his
own
house
he
confided
her
to
the
sisters
who
put
her
to
bed
a
burning
fever
had
come
on
she
passed
a
part
of
the
night
in
delirium
and
raving
at
length
however
she
fell
asleep
on
the
morrow
towards
midday
fantine
awoke
she
heard
some
one
breathing
close
to
her
bed
she
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
saw
m
madeleine
standing
there
and
looking
at
something
over
her
head
his
gaze
was
full
of
pity
anguish
and
supplication
she
followed
its
direction
and
saw
that
it
was
fixed
on
a
crucifix
which
was
nailed
to
the
wall
thenceforth
m
madeleine
was
transfigured
in
fantine
s
eyes
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
clothed
in
light
he
was
absorbed
in
a
sort
of
prayer
she
gazed
at
him
for
a
long
time
without
daring
to
interrupt
him
at
last
she
said
timidly
what
are
you
doing
m
madeleine
had
been
there
for
an
hour
he
had
been
waiting
for
fantine
to
awake
he
took
her
hand
felt
of
her
pulse
and
replied
how
do
you
feel
well
i
have
slept
she
replied
i
think
that
i
am
better
it
is
nothing
he
answered
responding
to
the
first
question
which
she
had
put
to
him
as
though
he
had
just
heard
it
i
was
praying
to
the
martyr
there
on
high
and
he
added
in
his
own
mind
for
the
martyr
here
below
m
madeleine
had
passed
the
night
and
the
morning
in
making
inquiries
he
knew
all
now
he
knew
fantine
s
history
in
all
its
heart
rending
details
he
went
on
you
have
suffered
much
poor
mother
oh
do
not
complain
you
now
have
the
dowry
of
the
elect
it
is
thus
that
men
are
transformed
into
angels
it
is
not
their
fault
they
do
not
know
how
to
go
to
work
otherwise
you
see
this
hell
from
which
you
have
just
emerged
is
the
first
form
of
heaven
it
was
necessary
to
begin
there
he
sighed
deeply
but
she
smiled
on
him
with
that
sublime
smile
in
which
two
teeth
were
lacking
that
same
night
javert
wrote
a
letter
the
next
morning
be
posted
it
himself
at
the
office
of
m
sur
m
it
was
addressed
to
paris
and
the
superscription
ran
to
monsieur
chabouillet
secretary
of
monsieur
le
prefet
of
police
as
the
affair
in
the
station
house
had
been
bruited
about
the
post
mistress
and
some
other
persons
who
saw
the
letter
before
it
was
sent
off
and
who
recognized
javert
s
handwriting
on
the
cover
thought
that
he
was
sending
in
his
resignation
m
madeleine
made
haste
to
write
to
the
thenardiers
fantine
owed
them
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
he
sent
them
three
hundred
francs
telling
them
to
pay
themselves
from
that
sum
and
to
fetch
the
child
instantly
to
m
sur
m
where
her
sick
mother
required
her
presence
this
dazzled
thenardier
the
devil
said
the
man
to
his
wife
don
t
let
s
allow
the
child
to
go
this
lark
is
going
to
turn
into
a
milch
cow
i
see
through
it
some
ninny
has
taken
a
fancy
to
the
mother
he
replied
with
a
very
well
drawn
up
bill
for
five
hundred
and
some
odd
francs
in
this
memorandum
two
indisputable
items
figured
up
over
three
hundred
francs
one
for
the
doctor
the
other
for
the
apothecary
who
had
attended
and
physicked
eponine
and
azelma
through
two
long
illnesses
cosette
as
we
have
already
said
had
not
been
ill
it
was
only
a
question
of
a
trifling
substitution
of
names
at
the
foot
of
the
memorandum

wrote
received
on
account
three
hundred
francs
m
madeleine
immediately
sent
three
hundred
francs
more
and
wrote

haste
to
bring
cosette
christi
said
thenardier
let
s
not
give
up
the
child
in
the
meantime
fantine
did
not
recover
she
still
remained
in
the
infirmary
the
sisters
had
at
first
only
received
and
nursed
that
woman
with
repugnance
those
who
have
seen
the
bas
reliefs
of
rheims
will
recall
the
inflation
of
the
lower
lip
of
the
wise
virgins
as
they
survey
the
foolish
virgins
the
ancient
scorn
of
the
vestals
for
the
ambubajae
is
one
of
the
most
profound
instincts
of
feminine
dignity
the
sisters
felt
it
with
the
double
force
contributed
by
religion
but
in
a
few
days
fantine
disarmed
them
she
said
all
kinds
of
humble
and
gentle
things
and
the
mother
in
her
provoked
tenderness
one
day
the
sisters
heard
her
say
amid
her
fever
i
have
been
a
sinner
but
when
i
have
my
child
beside
me
it
will
be
a
sign
that
god
has
pardoned
me
while
i
was
leading
a
bad
life
i
should
not
have
liked
to
have
my
cosette
with
me
i
could
not
have
borne
her
sad
astonished
eyes
it
was
for
her
sake
that
i
did
evil
and
that
is
why
god
pardons
me
i
shall
feel
the
benediction
of
the
good
god
when
cosette
is
here
i
shall
gaze
at
her
it
will
do
me
good
to
see
that
innocent
creature
she
knows
nothing
at
all
she
is
an
angel
you
see
my
sisters
at
that
age
the
wings
have
not
fallen
off
m
madeleine
went
to
see
her
twice
a
day
and
each
time
she
asked
him
shall
i
see
my
cosette
soon
he
answered
to
morrow
perhaps
she
may
arrive
at
any
moment
i
am
expecting
her
and
the
mother
s
pale
face
grew
radiant
oh
she
said
how
happy
i
am
going
to
be
we
have
just
said
that
she
did
not
recover
her
health
on
the
contrary
her
condition
seemed
to
become
more
grave
from
week
to
week
that
handful
of
snow
applied
to
her
bare
skin
between
her
shoulder
blades
had
brought
about
a
sudden
suppression
of
perspiration
as
a
consequence
of
which
the
malady
which
had
been
smouldering
within
her
for
many
years
was
violently
developed
at
last
at
that
time
people
were
beginning
to
follow
the
fine
laennec
s
fine
suggestions
in
the
study
and
treatment
of
chest
maladies
the
doctor
sounded
fantine
s
chest
and
shook
his
head
m
madeleine
said
to
the
doctor
well
has
she
not
a
child
which
she
desires
to
see
said
the
doctor
yes
well
make
haste
and
get
it
here
m
madeleine
shuddered
fantine
inquired
what
did
the
doctor
say
m
madeleine
forced
himself
to
smile
he
said
that
your
child
was
to
be
brought
speedily
that
that
would
restore
your
health
oh
she
rejoined
he
is
right
but
what
do
those
thenardiers
mean
by
keeping
my
cosette
from
me
oh
she
is
coming
at
last
i
behold
happiness
close
beside
me
in
the
meantime
thenardier
did
not
let
go
of
the
child
and
gave
a
hundred
insufficient
reasons
for
it
cosette
was
not
quite
well
enough
to
take
a
journey
in
the
winter
and
then
there
still
remained
some
petty
but
pressing
debts
in
the
neighborhood
and
they
were
collecting
the
bills
for
them
etc
etc
i
shall
send
some
one
to
fetch
cosette
said
father
madeleine
if
necessary
i
will
go
myself
he
wrote
the
following
letter
to
fantine
s
dictation
and
made
her
sign
it
monsieur
thenardier
you
will
deliver
cosette
to
this
person
you
will
be
paid
for
all
the
little
things
i
have
the
honor
to
salute
you
with
respect
fantine
in
the
meantime
a
serious
incident
occurred
carve
as
we
will
the
mysterious
block
of
which
our
life
is
made
the
black
vein
of
destiny
constantly
reappears
in
it
chapter
ii
how
jean
may
become
champ
one
morning
m
madeleine
was
in
his
study
occupied
in
arranging
in
advance
some
pressing
matters
connected
with
the
mayor
s
office
in
case
he
should
decide
to
take
the
trip
to
montfermeil
when
he
was
informed
that
police
inspector
javert
was
desirous
of
speaking
with
him
madeleine
could
not
refrain
from
a
disagreeable
impression
on
hearing
this
name
javert
had
avoided
him
more
than
ever
since
the
affair
of
the
police
station
and
m
madeleine
had
not
seen
him
admit
him
he
said
javert
entered
m
madeleine
had
retained
his
seat
near
the
fire
pen
in
hand
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
docket
which
he
was
turning
over
and
annotating
and
which
contained
the
trials
of
the
commission
on
highways
for
the
infraction
of
police
regulations
he
did
not
disturb
himself
on
javert
s
account
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
poor
fantine
and
it
suited
him
to
be
glacial
in
his
manner
javert
bestowed
a
respectful
salute
on
the
mayor
whose
back
was
turned
to
him
the
mayor
did
not
look
at
him
but
went
on
annotating
this
docket
javert
advanced
two
or
three
paces
into
the
study
and
halted
without
breaking
the
silence
if
any
physiognomist
who
had
been
familiar
with
javert
and
who
had
made
a
lengthy
study
of
this
savage
in
the
service
of
civilization
this
singular
composite
of
the
roman
the
spartan
the
monk
and
the
corporal
this
spy
who
was
incapable
of
a
lie
this
unspotted
police
agent
if
any
physiognomist
had
known
his
secret
and
long
cherished
aversion
for
m
madeleine
his
conflict
with
the
mayor
on
the
subject
of
fantine
and
had
examined
javert
at
that
moment
he
would
have
said
to
himself
what
has
taken
place
it
was
evident
to
any
one
acquainted
with
that
clear
upright
sincere
honest
austere
and
ferocious
conscience
that
javert
had
but
just
gone
through
some
great
interior
struggle
javert
had
nothing
in
his
soul
which
he
had
not
also
in
his
countenance
like
violent
people
in
general
he
was
subject
to
abrupt
changes
of
opinion
his
physiognomy
had
never
been
more
peculiar
and
startling
on
entering
he
bowed
to
m
madeleine
with
a
look
in
which
there
was
neither
rancor
anger
nor
distrust
he
halted
a
few
paces
in
the
rear
of
the
mayor
s
arm
chair
and
there
he
stood
perfectly
erect
in
an
attitude
almost
of
discipline
with
the
cold
ingenuous
roughness
of
a
man
who
has
never
been
gentle
and
who
has
always
been
patient
he
waited
without
uttering
a
word
without
making
a
movement
in
genuine
humility
and
tranquil
resignation
calm
serious
hat
in
hand
with
eyes
cast
down
and
an
expression
which
was
half
way
between
that
of
a
soldier
in
the
presence
of
his
officer
and
a
criminal
in
the
presence
of
his
judge
until
it
should
please
the
mayor
to
turn
round
all
the
sentiments
as
well
as
all
the
memories
which
one
might
have
attributed
to
him
had
disappeared
that
face
as
impenetrable
and
simple
as
granite
no
longer
bore
any
trace
of
anything
but
a
melancholy
depression
his
whole
person
breathed
lowliness
and
firmness
and
an
indescribable
courageous
despondency
at
last
the
mayor
laid
down
his
pen
and
turned
half
round
well
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
javert
javert
remained
silent
for
an
instant
as
though
collecting
his
ideas
then
raised
his
voice
with
a
sort
of
sad
solemnity
which
did
not
however
preclude
simplicity
this
is
the
matter
mr
mayor
a
culpable
act
has
been
committed
what
act
an
inferior
agent
of
the
authorities
has
failed
in
respect
and
in
the
gravest
manner
towards
a
magistrate
i
have
come
to
bring
the
fact
to
your
knowledge
as
it
is
my
duty
to
do
who
is
the
agent
asked
m
madeleine
i
said
javert
you
i
and
who
is
the
magistrate
who
has
reason
to
complain
of
the
agent
you
mr
mayor
m
madeleine
sat
erect
in
his
arm
chair
javert
went
on
with
a
severe
air
and
his
eyes
still
cast
down
mr
mayor
i
have
come
to
request
you
to
instigate
the
authorities
to
dismiss
me
m
madeleine
opened
his
mouth
in
amazement
javert
interrupted
him
you
will
say
that
i
might
have
handed
in
my
resignation
but
that
does
not
suffice
handing
in
one
s
resignation
is
honorable
i
have
failed
in
my
duty
i
ought
to
be
punished
i
must
be
turned
out
and
after
a
pause
he
added
mr
mayor
you
were
severe
with
me
the
other
day
and
unjustly
be
so
to
day
with
justice
come
now
why
exclaimed
m
madeleine
what
nonsense
is
this
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
what
culpable
act
have
you
been
guilty
of
towards
me
what
have
you
done
to
me
what
are
your
wrongs
with
regard
to
me
you
accuse
yourself
you
wish
to
be
superseded
turned
out
said
javert
turned
out
so
it
be
then
that
is
well
i
do
not
understand
you
shall
understand
mr
mayor
javert
sighed
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
chest
and
resumed
still
coldly
and
sadly
mr
mayor
six
weeks
ago
in
consequence
of
the
scene
over
that
woman
i
was
furious
and
i
informed
against
you
informed
against
me
at
the
prefecture
of
police
in
paris
m
madeleine
who
was
not
in
the
habit
of
laughing
much
oftener
than
javert
himself
burst
out
laughing
now
as
a
mayor
who
had
encroached
on
the
province
of
the
police
as
an
ex
convict
the
mayor
turned
livid
javert
who
had
not
raised
his
eyes
went
on
i
thought
it
was
so
i
had
had
an
idea
for
a
long
time
a
resemblance
inquiries
which
you
had
caused
to
be
made
at
faverolles
the
strength
of
your
loins
the
adventure
with
old
fauchelevant
your
skill
in
marksmanship
your
leg
which
you
drag
a
little
i
hardly
know
what
all
absurdities
but
at
all
events
i
took
you
for
a
certain
jean
valjean
a
certain
what
did
you
say
the
name
was
jean
valjean
he
was
a
convict
whom
i
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
twenty
years
ago
when
i
was
adjutant
guard
of
convicts
at
toulon
on
leaving
the
galleys
this
jean
valjean
as
it
appears
robbed
a
bishop
then
he
committed
another
theft
accompanied
with
violence
on
a
public
highway
on
the
person
of
a
little
savoyard
he
disappeared
eight
years
ago
no
one
knows
how
and
he
has
been
sought
i
fancied
in
short
i
did
this
thing
wrath
impelled
me
i
denounced
you
at
the
prefecture
m
madeleine
who
had
taken
up
the
docket
again
several
moments
before
this
resumed
with
an
air
of
perfect
indifference
and
what
reply
did
you
receive
that
i
was
mad
well
well
they
were
right
it
is
lucky
that
you
recognize
the
fact
i
am
forced
to
do
so
since
the
real
jean
valjean
has
been
found
the
sheet
of
paper
which
m
madeleine
was
holding
dropped
from
his
hand
he
raised
his
head
gazed
fixedly
at
javert
and
said
with
his
indescribable
accent
ah
javert
continued
this
is
the
way
it
is
mr
mayor
it
seems
that
there
was
in
the
neighborhood
near
ailly
le
haut
clocher
an
old
fellow
who
was
called
father
champmathieu
he
was
a
very
wretched
creature
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
no
one
knows
what
such
people
subsist
on
lately
last
autumn
father
champmathieu
was
arrested
for
the
theft
of
some
cider
apples
from
well
no
matter
a
theft
had
been
committed
a
wall
scaled
branches
of
trees
broken
my
champmathieu
was
arrested
he
still
had
the
branch
of
apple
tree
in
his
hand
the
scamp
is
locked
up
up
to
this
point
it
was
merely
an
affair
of
a
misdemeanor
but
here
is
where
providence
intervened
the
jail
being
in
a
bad
condition
the
examining
magistrate
finds
it
convenient
to
transfer
champmathieu
to
arras
where
the
departmental
prison
is
situated
in
this
prison
at
arras
there
is
an
ex
convict
named
brevet
who
is
detained
for
i
know
not
what
and
who
has
been
appointed
turnkey
of
the
house
because
of
good
behavior
mr
mayor
no
sooner
had
champmathieu
arrived
than
brevet
exclaims
eh
why
i
know
that
man
he
is
a
fagot
4
take
a
good
look
at
me
my
good
man
you
are
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
who
s
jean
valjean
champmathieu
feigns
astonishment
don
t
play
the
innocent
dodge
says
brevet
you
are
jean
valjean
you
have
been
in
the
galleys
of
toulon
it
was
twenty
years
ago
we
were
there
together
champmathieu
denies
it
parbleu
you
understand
the
case
is
investigated
the
thing
was
well
ventilated
for
me
this
is
what
they
discovered
this
champmathieu
had
been
thirty
years
ago
a
pruner
of
trees
in
various
localities
notably
at
faverolles
there
all
trace
of
him
was
lost
a
long
time
afterwards
he
was
seen
again
in
auvergne
then
in
paris
where
he
is
said
to
have
been
a
wheelwright
and
to
have
had
a
daughter
who
was
a
laundress
but
that
has
not
been
proved
now
before
going
to
the
galleys
for
theft
what
was
jean
valjean
a
pruner
of
trees
where
at
faverolles
another
fact
this
valjean
s
christian
name
was
jean
and
his
mother
s
surname
was
mathieu
what
more
natural
to
suppose
than
that
on
emerging
from
the
galleys
he
should
have
taken
his
mother
s
name
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
himself
and
have
called
himself
jean
mathieu
he
goes
to
auvergne
the
local
pronunciation
turns
jean
into
chan
he
is
called
chan
mathieu
our
man
offers
no
opposition
and
behold
him
transformed
into
champmathieu
you
follow
me
do
you
not
inquiries
were
made
at
faverolles
the
family
of
jean
valjean
is
no
longer
there
it
is
not
known
where
they
have
gone
you
know
that
among
those
classes
a
family
often
disappears
search
was
made
and
nothing
was
found
when
such
people
are
not
mud
they
are
dust
and
then
as
the
beginning
of
the
story
dates
thirty
years
back
there
is
no
longer
any
one
at
faverolles
who
knew
jean
valjean
inquiries
were
made
at
toulon
besides
brevet
there
are
only
two
convicts
in
existence
who
have
seen
jean
valjean
they
are
cochepaille
and
chenildieu
and
are
sentenced
for
life
they
are
taken
from
the
galleys
and
confronted
with
the
pretended
champmathieu
they
do
not
hesitate
he
is
jean
valjean
for
them
as
well
as
for
brevet
the
same
age
he
is
fifty
four
the
same
height
the
same
air
the
same
man
in
short
it
is
he
it
was
precisely
at
this
moment
that
i
forwarded
my
denunciation
to
the
prefecture
in
paris
i
was
told
that
i
had
lost
my
reason
and
that
jean
valjean
is
at
arras
in
the
power
of
the
authorities
you
can
imagine
whether
this
surprised
me
when
i
thought
that
i
had
that
same
jean
valjean
here
i
write
to
the
examining
judge
he
sends
for
me
champmathieu
is
conducted
to
me
well
interposed
m
madeleine
javert
replied
his
face
incorruptible
and
as
melancholy
as
ever
mr
mayor
the
truth
is
the
truth
i
am
sorry
but
that
man
is
jean
valjean
i
recognized
him
also
m
madeleine
resumed
in
a
very
low
voice
you
are
sure
javert
began
to
laugh
with
that
mournful
laugh
which
comes
from
profound
conviction
o
sure
he
stood
there
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
mechanically
taking
pinches
of
powdered
wood
for
blotting
ink
from
the
wooden
bowl
which
stood
on
the
table
and
he
added
and
even
now
that
i
have
seen
the
real
jean
valjean
i
do
not
see
how
i
could
have
thought
otherwise
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
mayor
javert
as
he
addressed
these
grave
and
supplicating
words
to
the
man
who
six
weeks
before
had
humiliated
him
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
station
house
and
bade
him
leave
the
room
javert
that
haughty
man
was
unconsciously
full
of
simplicity
and
dignity
m
madeleine
made
no
other
reply
to
his
prayer
than
the
abrupt
question
and
what
does
this
man
say
ah
indeed
mr
mayor
it
s
a
bad
business
if
he
is
jean
valjean
he
has
his
previous
conviction
against
him
to
climb
a
wall
to
break
a
branch
to
purloin
apples
is
a
mischievous
trick
in
a
child
for
a
man
it
is
a
misdemeanor
for
a
convict
it
is
a
crime
robbing
and
housebreaking
it
is
all
there
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
correctional
police
it
is
a
matter
for
the
court
of
assizes
it
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
a
few
days
in
prison
it
is
the
galleys
for
life
and
then
there
is
the
affair
with
the
little
savoyard
who
will
return
i
hope
the
deuce
there
is
plenty
to
dispute
in
the
matter
is
there
not
yes
for
any
one
but
jean
valjean
but
jean
valjean
is
a
sly
dog
that
is
the
way
i
recognized
him
any
other
man
would
have
felt
that
things
were
getting
hot
for
him
he
would
struggle
he
would
cry
out
the
kettle
sings
before
the
fire
he
would
not
be
jean
valjean
et
cetera
but
he
has
not
the
appearance
of
understanding
he
says
i
am
champmathieu
and
i
won
t
depart
from
that
he
has
an
astonished
air
he
pretends
to
be
stupid
it
is
far
better
oh
the
rogue
is
clever
but
it
makes
no
difference
the
proofs
are
there
he
has
been
recognized
by
four
persons
the
old
scamp
will
be
condemned
the
case
has
been
taken
to
the
assizes
at
arras
i
shall
go
there
to
give
my
testimony
i
have
been
summoned
m
madeleine
had
turned
to
his
desk
again
and
taken
up
his
docket
and
was
turning
over
the
leaves
tranquilly
reading
and
writing
by
turns
like
a
busy
man
he
turned
to
javert
that
will
do
javert
in
truth
all
these
details
interest
me
but
little
we
are
wasting
our
time
and
we
have
pressing
business
on
hand
javert
you
will
betake
yourself
at
once
to
the
house
of
the
woman
buseaupied
who
sells
herbs
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
saint
saulve
you
will
tell
her
that
she
must
enter
her
complaint
against
carter
pierre
chesnelong
the
man
is
a
brute
who
came
near
crushing
this
woman
and
her
child
he
must
be
punished
you
will
then
go
to
m
charcellay
rue
montre
de
champigny
he
complained
that
there
is
a
gutter
on
the
adjoining
house
which
discharges
rain
water
on
his
premises
and
is
undermining
the
foundations
of
his
house
after
that
you
will
verify
the
infractions
of
police
regulations
which
have
been
reported
to
me
in
the
rue
guibourg
at
widow
doris
s
and
rue
du
garraud
blanc
at
madame
renee
le
bosse
s
and
you
will
prepare
documents
but
i
am
giving
you
a
great
deal
of
work
are
you
not
to
be
absent
did
you
not
tell
me
that
you
were
going
to
arras
on
that
matter
in
a
week
or
ten
days
sooner
than
that
mr
mayor
on
what
day
then
why
i
thought
that
i
had
said
to
monsieur
le
maire
that
the
case
was
to
be
tried
to
morrow
and
that
i
am
to
set
out
by
diligence
to
night
m
madeleine
made
an
imperceptible
movement
and
how
long
will
the
case
last
one
day
at
the
most
the
judgment
will
be
pronounced
to
morrow
evening
at
latest
but
i
shall
not
wait
for
the
sentence
which
is
certain
i
shall
return
here
as
soon
as
my
deposition
has
been
taken
that
is
well
said
m
madeleine
and
he
dismissed
javert
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
javert
did
not
withdraw
excuse
me
mr
mayor
said
he
what
is
it
now
demanded
m
madeleine
mr
mayor
there
is
still
something
of
which
i
must
remind
you
what
is
it
that
i
must
be
dismissed
m
madeleine
rose
javert
you
are
a
man
of
honor
and
i
esteem
you
you
exaggerate
your
fault
moreover
this
is
an
offence
which
concerns
me
javert
you
deserve
promotion
instead
of
degradation
i
wish
you
to
retain
your
post
javert
gazed
at
m
madeleine
with
his
candid
eyes
in
whose
depths
his
not
very
enlightened
but
pure
and
rigid
conscience
seemed
visible
and
said
in
a
tranquil
voice
mr
mayor
i
cannot
grant
you
that
i
repeat
replied
m
madeleine
that
the
matter
concerns
me
but
javert
heeding
his
own
thought
only
continued
so
far
as
exaggeration
is
concerned
i
am
not
exaggerating
this
is
the
way
i
reason
i
have
suspected
you
unjustly
that
is
nothing
it
is
our
right
to
cherish
suspicion
although
suspicion
directed
above
ourselves
is
an
abuse
but
without
proofs
in
a
fit
of
rage
with
the
object
of
wreaking
my
vengeance
i
have
denounced
you
as
a
convict
you
a
respectable
man
a
mayor
a
magistrate
that
is
serious
very
serious
i
have
insulted
authority
in
your
person
i
an
agent
of
the
authorities
if
one
of
my
subordinates
had
done
what
i
have
done
i
should
have
declared
him
unworthy
of
the
service
and
have
expelled
him
well
stop
mr
mayor
one
word
more
i
have
often
been
severe
in
the
course
of
my
life
towards
others
that
is
just
i
have
done
well
now
if
i
were
not
severe
towards
myself
all
the
justice
that
i
have
done
would
become
injustice
ought
i
to
spare
myself
more
than
others
no
what
i
should
be
good
for
nothing
but
to
chastise
others
and
not
myself
why
i
should
be
a
blackguard
those
who
say
that
blackguard
of
a
javert
would
be
in
the
right
mr
mayor
i
do
not
desire
that
you
should
treat
me
kindly
your
kindness
roused
sufficient
bad
blood
in
me
when
it
was
directed
to
others
i
want
none
of
it
for
myself
the
kindness
which
consists
in
upholding
a
woman
of
the
town
against
a
citizen
the
police
agent
against
the
mayor
the
man
who
is
down
against
the
man
who
is
up
in
the
world
is
what
i
call
false
kindness
that
is
the
sort
of
kindness
which
disorganizes
society
good
god
it
is
very
easy
to
be
kind
the
difficulty
lies
in
being
just
come
if
you
had
been
what
i
thought
you
i
should
not
have
been
kind
to
you
not
i
you
would
have
seen
mr
mayor
i
must
treat
myself
as
i
would
treat
any
other
man
when
i
have
subdued
malefactors
when
i
have
proceeded
with
vigor
against
rascals
i
have
often
said
to
myself
if
you
flinch
if
i
ever
catch
you
in
fault
you
may
rest
at
your
ease
i
have
flinched
i
have
caught
myself
in
a
fault
so
much
the
worse
come
discharged
cashiered
expelled
that
is
well
i
have
arms
i
will
till
the
soil
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
mr
mayor
the
good
of
the
service
demands
an
example
i
simply
require
the
discharge
of
inspector
javert
all
this
was
uttered
in
a
proud
humble
despairing
yet
convinced
tone
which
lent
indescribable
grandeur
to
this
singular
honest
man
we
shall
see
said
m
madeleine
and
he
offered
him
his
hand
javert
recoiled
and
said
in
a
wild
voice
excuse
me
mr
mayor
but
this
must
not
be
a
mayor
does
not
offer
his
hand
to
a
police
spy
he
added
between
his
teeth
a
police
spy
yes
from
the
moment
when
i
have
misused
the
police
i
am
no
more
than
a
police
spy
then
he
bowed
profoundly
and
directed
his
steps
towards
the
door
there
he
wheeled
round
and
with
eyes
still
downcast
mr
mayor
he
said
i
shall
continue
to
serve
until
i
am
superseded
he
withdrew
m
madeleine
remained
thoughtfully
listening
to
the
firm
sure
step
which
died
away
on
the
pavement
of
the
corridor
book
seventh
the
champmathieu
affair
chapter
i
sister
simplice
the
incidents
the
reader
is
about
to
peruse
were
not
all
known
at
m
sur
m
but
the
small
portion
of
them
which
became
known
left
such
a
memory
in
that
town
that
a
serious
gap
would
exist
in
this
book
if
we
did
not
narrate
them
in
their
most
minute
details
among
these
details
the
reader
will
encounter
two
or
three
improbable
circumstances
which
we
preserve
out
of
respect
for
the
truth
on
the
afternoon
following
the
visit
of
javert
m
madeleine
went
to
see
fantine
according
to
his
wont
before
entering
fantine
s
room
he
had
sister
simplice
summoned
the
two
nuns
who
performed
the
services
of
nurse
in
the
infirmary
lazariste
ladies
like
all
sisters
of
charity
bore
the
names
of
sister
perpetue
and
sister
simplice
sister
perpetue
was
an
ordinary
villager
a
sister
of
charity
in
a
coarse
style
who
had
entered
the
service
of
god
as
one
enters
any
other
service
she
was
a
nun
as
other
women
are
cooks
this
type
is
not
so
very
rare
the
monastic
orders
gladly
accept
this
heavy
peasant
earthenware
which
is
easily
fashioned
into
a
capuchin
or
an
ursuline
these
rustics
are
utilized
for
the
rough
work
of
devotion
the
transition
from
a
drover
to
a
carmelite
is
not
in
the
least
violent
the
one
turns
into
the
other
without
much
effort
the
fund
of
ignorance
common
to
the
village
and
the
cloister
is
a
preparation
ready
at
hand
and
places
the
boor
at
once
on
the
same
footing
as
the
monk
a
little
more
amplitude
in
the
smock
and
it
becomes
a
frock
sister
perpetue
was
a
robust
nun
from
marines
near
pontoise
who
chattered
her
patois
droned
grumbled
sugared
the
potion
according
to
the
bigotry
or
the
hypocrisy
of
the
invalid
treated
her
patients
abruptly
roughly
was
crabbed
with
the
dying
almost
flung
god
in
their
faces
stoned
their
death
agony
with
prayers
mumbled
in
a
rage
was
bold
honest
and
ruddy
sister
simplice
was
white
with
a
waxen
pallor
beside
sister
perpetue
she
was
the
taper
beside
the
candle
vincent
de
paul
has
divinely
traced
the
features
of
the
sister
of
charity
in
these
admirable
words
in
which
he
mingles
as
much
freedom
as
servitude
they
shall
have
for
their
convent
only
the
house
of
the
sick
for
cell
only
a
hired
room
for
chapel
only
their
parish
church
for
cloister
only
the
streets
of
the
town
and
the
wards
of
the
hospitals
for
enclosure
only
obedience
for
gratings
only
the
fear
of
god
for
veil
only
modesty
this
ideal
was
realized
in
the
living
person
of
sister
simplice
she
had
never
been
young
and
it
seemed
as
though
she
would
never
grow
old
no
one
could
have
told
sister
simplice
s
age
she
was
a
person
we
dare
not
say
a
woman
who
was
gentle
austere
well
bred
cold
and
who
had
never
lied
she
was
so
gentle
that
she
appeared
fragile
but
she
was
more
solid
than
granite
she
touched
the
unhappy
with
fingers
that
were
charmingly
pure
and
fine
there
was
so
to
speak
silence
in
her
speech
she
said
just
what
was
necessary
and
she
possessed
a
tone
of
voice
which
would
have
equally
edified
a
confessional
or
enchanted
a
drawing
room
this
delicacy
accommodated
itself
to
the
serge
gown
finding
in
this
harsh
contact
a
continual
reminder
of
heaven
and
of
god
let
us
emphasize
one
detail
never
to
have
lied
never
to
have
said
for
any
interest
whatever
even
in
indifference
any
single
thing
which
was
not
the
truth
the
sacred
truth
was
sister
simplice
s
distinctive
trait
it
was
the
accent
of
her
virtue
she
was
almost
renowned
in
the
congregation
for
this
imperturbable
veracity
the
abbe
sicard
speaks
of
sister
simplice
in
a
letter
to
the
deaf
mute
massieu
however
pure
and
sincere
we
may
be
we
all
bear
upon
our
candor
the
crack
of
the
little
innocent
lie
she
did
not
little
lie
innocent
lie
does
such
a
thing
exist
to
lie
is
the
absolute
form
of
evil
to
lie
a
little
is
not
possible
he
who
lies
lies
the
whole
lie
to
lie
is
the
very
face
of
the
demon
satan
has
two
names
he
is
called
satan
and
lying
that
is
what
she
thought
and
as
she
thought
so
she
did
the
result
was
the
whiteness
which
we
have
mentioned
a
whiteness
which
covered
even
her
lips
and
her
eyes
with
radiance
her
smile
was
white
her
glance
was
white
there
was
not
a
single
spider
s
web
not
a
grain
of
dust
on
the
glass
window
of
that
conscience
on
entering
the
order
of
saint
vincent
de
paul
she
had
taken
the
name
of
simplice
by
special
choice
simplice
of
sicily
as
we
know
is
the
saint
who
preferred
to
allow
both
her
breasts
to
be
torn
off
rather
than
to
say
that
she
had
been
born
at
segesta
when
she
had
been
born
at
syracuse
a
lie
which
would
have
saved
her
this
patron
saint
suited
this
soul
sister
simplice
on
her
entrance
into
the
order
had
had
two
faults
which
she
had
gradually
corrected
she
had
a
taste
for
dainties
and
she
liked
to
receive
letters
she
never
read
anything
but
a
book
of
prayers
printed
in
latin
in
coarse
type
she
did
not
understand
latin
but
she
understood
the
book
this
pious
woman
had
conceived
an
affection
for
fantine
probably
feeling
a
latent
virtue
there
and
she
had
devoted
herself
almost
exclusively
to
her
care
m
madeleine
took
sister
simplice
apart
and
recommended
fantine
to
her
in
a
singular
tone
which
the
sister
recalled
later
on
on
leaving
the
sister
he
approached
fantine
fantine
awaited
m
madeleine
s
appearance
every
day
as
one
awaits
a
ray
of
warmth
and
joy
she
said
to
the
sisters
i
only
live
when
monsieur
le
maire
is
here
she
had
a
great
deal
of
fever
that
day
as
soon
as
she
saw
m
madeleine
she
asked
him
and
cosette
he
replied
with
a
smile
soon
m
madeleine
was
the
same
as
usual
with
fantine
only
he
remained
an
hour
instead
of
half
an
hour
to
fantine
s
great
delight
he
urged
every
one
repeatedly
not
to
allow
the
invalid
to
want
for
anything
it
was
noticed
that
there
was
a
moment
when
his
countenance
became
very
sombre
but
this
was
explained
when
it
became
known
that
the
doctor
had
bent
down
to
his
ear
and
said
to
him
she
is
losing
ground
fast
then
he
returned
to
the
town
hall
and
the
clerk
observed
him
attentively
examining
a
road
map
of
france
which
hung
in
his
study
he
wrote
a
few
figures
on
a
bit
of
paper
with
a
pencil
chapter
ii
the
perspicacity
of
master
scaufflaire
from
the
town
hall
he
betook
himself
to
the
extremity
of
the
town
to
a
fleming
named
master
scaufflaer
french
scaufflaire
who
let
out
horses
and
cabriolets
as
desired
in
order
to
reach
this
scaufflaire
the
shortest
way
was
to
take
the
little
frequented
street
in
which
was
situated
the
parsonage
of
the
parish
in
which
m
madeleine
resided
the
cure
was
it
was
said
a
worthy
respectable
and
sensible
man
at
the
moment
when
m
madeleine
arrived
in
front
of
the
parsonage
there
was
but
one
passer
by
in
the
street
and
this
person
noticed
this
after
the
mayor
had
passed
the
priest
s
house
he
halted
stood
motionless
then
turned
about
and
retraced
his
steps
to
the
door
of
the
parsonage
which
had
an
iron
knocker
he
laid
his
hand
quickly
on
the
knocker
and
lifted
it
then
he
paused
again
and
stopped
short
as
though
in
thought
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
seconds
instead
of
allowing
the
knocker
to
fall
abruptly
he
placed
it
gently
and
resumed
his
way
with
a
sort
of
haste
which
had
not
been
apparent
previously
m
madeleine
found
master
scaufflaire
at
home
engaged
in
stitching
a
harness
over
master
scaufflaire
he
inquired
have
you
a
good
horse
mr
mayor
said
the
fleming
all
my
horses
are
good
what
do
you
mean
by
a
good
horse
i
mean
a
horse
which
can
travel
twenty
leagues
in
a
day
the
deuce
said
the
fleming
twenty
leagues
yes
hitched
to
a
cabriolet
yes
and
how
long
can
he
rest
at
the
end
of
his
journey
he
must
be
able
to
set
out
again
on
the
next
day
if
necessary
to
traverse
the
same
road
yes
the
deuce
the
deuce
and
it
is
twenty
leagues
m
madeleine
drew
from
his
pocket
the
paper
on
which
he
had
pencilled
some
figures
he
showed
it
to
the
fleming
the
figures
were
5
6
8
1
2
you
see
he
said
total
nineteen
and
a
half
as
well
say
twenty
leagues
mr
mayor
returned
the
fleming
i
have
just
what
you
want
my
little
white
horse
you
may
have
seen
him
pass
occasionally
he
is
a
small
beast
from
lower
boulonnais
he
is
full
of
fire
they
wanted
to
make
a
saddle
horse
of
him
at
first
bah
he
reared
he
kicked
he
laid
everybody
flat
on
the
ground
he
was
thought
to
be
vicious
and
no
one
knew
what
to
do
with
him
i
bought
him
i
harnessed
him
to
a
carriage
that
is
what
he
wanted
sir
he
is
as
gentle
as
a
girl
he
goes
like
the
wind
ah
indeed
he
must
not
be
mounted
it
does
not
suit
his
ideas
to
be
a
saddle
horse
every
one
has
his
ambition
draw
yes
carry
no
we
must
suppose
that
is
what
he
said
to
himself
and
he
will
accomplish
the
trip
your
twenty
leagues
all
at
a
full
trot
and
in
less
than
eight
hours
but
here
are
the
conditions
state
them
in
the
first
place
you
will
give
him
half
an
hour
s
breathing
spell
midway
of
the
road
he
will
eat
and
some
one
must
be
by
while
he
is
eating
to
prevent
the
stable
boy
of
the
inn
from
stealing
his
oats
for
i
have
noticed
that
in
inns
the
oats
are
more
often
drunk
by
the
stable
men
than
eaten
by
the
horses
some
one
will
be
by
in
the
second
place
is
the
cabriolet
for
monsieur
le
maire
yes
does
monsieur
le
maire
know
how
to
drive
yes
well
monsieur
le
maire
will
travel
alone
and
without
baggage
in
order
not
to
overload
the
horse
agreed
but
as
monsieur
le
maire
will
have
no
one
with
him
he
will
be
obliged
to
take
the
trouble
himself
of
seeing
that
the
oats
are
not
stolen
that
is
understood
i
am
to
have
thirty
francs
a
day
the
days
of
rest
to
be
paid
for
also
not
a
farthing
less
and
the
beast
s
food
to
be
at
monsieur
le
maire
s
expense
m
madeleine
drew
three
napoleons
from
his
purse
and
laid
them
on
the
table
here
is
the
pay
for
two
days
in
advance
fourthly
for
such
a
journey
a
cabriolet
would
be
too
heavy
and
would
fatigue
the
horse
monsieur
le
maire
must
consent
to
travel
in
a
little
tilbury
that
i
own
i
consent
to
that
it
is
light
but
it
has
no
cover
that
makes
no
difference
to
me
has
monsieur
le
maire
reflected
that
we
are
in
the
middle
of
winter
m
madeleine
did
not
reply
the
fleming
resumed
that
it
is
very
cold
m
madeleine
preserved
silence
master
scaufflaire
continued
that
it
may
rain
m
madeleine
raised
his
head
and
said
the
tilbury
and
the
horse
will
be
in
front
of
my
door
to
morrow
morning
at
half
past
four
o
clock
of
course
monsieur
le
maire
replied
scaufflaire
then
scratching
a
speck
in
the
wood
of
the
table
with
his
thumb
nail
he
resumed
with
that
careless
air
which
the
flemings
understand
so
well
how
to
mingle
with
their
shrewdness
but
this
is
what
i
am
thinking
of
now
monsieur
le
maire
has
not
told
me
where
he
is
going
where
is
monsieur
le
maire
going
he
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
else
since
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
but
he
did
not
know
why
he
had
not
dared
to
put
the
question
are
your
horse
s
forelegs
good
said
m
madeleine
yes
monsieur
le
maire
you
must
hold
him
in
a
little
when
going
down
hill
are
there
many
descends
between
here
and
the
place
whither
you
are
going
do
not
forget
to
be
at
my
door
at
precisely
half
past
four
o
clock
to
morrow
morning
replied
m
madeleine
and
he
took
his
departure
the
fleming
remained
utterly
stupid
as
he
himself
said
some
time
afterwards
the
mayor
had
been
gone
two
or
three
minutes
when
the
door
opened
again
it
was
the
mayor
once
more
he
still
wore
the
same
impassive
and
preoccupied
air
monsieur
scaufflaire
said
he
at
what
sum
do
you
estimate
the
value
of
the
horse
and
tilbury
which
you
are
to
let
to
me
the
one
bearing
the
other
the
one
dragging
the
other
monsieur
le
maire
said
the
fleming
with
a
broad
smile
so
be
it
well
does
monsieur
le
maire
wish
to
purchase
them
or
me
no
but
i
wish
to
guarantee
you
in
any
case
you
shall
give
me
back
the
sum
at
my
return
at
what
value

then
left

and
this
time
he
did

return
master

experienced
a
frightful
regret
that
he
had
not
said
a
thousand
francs
besides
the
horse
and
tilbury
together
were
worth
but
a
hundred
crowns
the
fleming
called
his

and
related
the
affair
to
her
where
the
devil
could
monsieur

be
going
they
held
counsel
together

the

i
don

believe

said
the
husband
m
madeleine
had
forgotten
the
paper
with
the
figures
on
it
and
it
lay
on
the
chimney

the

picked
it
up
and
studied

and
a
half
from

to

he
is
going
to
arras
meanwhile
m
madeleine
had
returned
home
he
had
taken
the
longest
way
to
return
from
master
scaufflaire
s
as
though
the
parsonage
door
had
been
a
temptation
for
him
and
he
had
wished
to
avoid
it
he
ascended
to
his
room
and
there
he
shut
himself
up
which
was
a
very
simple
act
since
he
liked
to
go
to
bed
early
nevertheless
the
portress
of
the
factory
who
was
at
the
same
time
m
madeleine
s
only
servant
noticed
that
the
latter
s
light
was
extinguished
at
half
past
eight
and
she
mentioned
it
to
the
cashier
when
he
came
home
adding
is
monsieur
le
maire
ill
i
thought
he
had
a
rather
singular
air
this
cashier
occupied
a
room
situated
directly
under
m
madeleine
s
chamber
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
portress
s
words
but
went
to
bed
and
to
sleep
towards
midnight
he
woke
up
with
a
start
in
his
sleep
he
had
heard
a
noise
above
his
head
he
listened
it
was
a
footstep
pacing
back
and
forth
as
though
some
one
were
walking
in
the
room
above
him
he
listened
more
attentively
and
recognized
m
madeleine
s
step
this
struck
him
as
strange
usually
there
was
no
noise
in
m
madeleine
s
chamber
until
he
rose
in
the
morning
a
moment
later
the
cashier
heard
a
noise
which
resembled
that
of
a
cupboard
being
opened
and
then
shut
again
then
a
piece
of
furniture
was
disarranged
then
a
pause
ensued
then
the
step
began
again
the
cashier
sat
up
in
bed
quite
awake
now
and
staring
and
through
his
window
panes
he
saw
the
reddish
gleam
of
a
lighted
window
reflected
on
the
opposite
wall
from
the
direction
of
the
rays
it
could
only
come
from
the
window
of
m
madeleine
s
chamber
the
reflection
wavered
as
though
it
came
rather
from
a
fire
which
had
been
lighted
than
from
a
candle
the
shadow
of
the
window
frame
was
not
shown
which
indicated
that
the
window
was
wide
open
the
fact
that
this
window
was
open
in
such
cold
weather
was
surprising
the
cashier
fell
asleep
again
an
hour
or
two
later
he
waked
again
the
same
step
was
still
passing
slowly
and
regularly
back
and
forth
overhead
the
reflection
was
still
visible
on
the
wall
but
now
it
was
pale
and
peaceful
like
the
reflection
of
a
lamp
or
of
a
candle
the
window
was
still
open
this
is
what
had
taken
place
in

madeleine

room

a
tempest
in
a
skull
the
reader
has
no
doubt
already
divined
that
m
madeleine
is
no
other
than
jean
valjean
we
have
already
gazed
into
the
depths
of
this
conscience
the
moment
has
now
come
when
we
must
take
another
look
into
it
we
do
so
not
without
emotion
and
trepidation
there
is
nothing
more
terrible
in
existence
than
this
sort
of
contemplation
the
eye
of
the
spirit
can
nowhere
find
more
dazzling
brilliance
and
more
shadow
than
in
man
it
can
fix
itself
on
no
other
thing
which
is
more
formidable
more
complicated
more
mysterious
and
more
infinite
there
is
a
spectacle
more
grand
than
the
sea
it
is
heaven
there
is
a
spectacle
more
grand
than
heaven
it
is
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
soul
to
make
the
poem
of
the
human
conscience
were
it
only
with
reference
to
a
single
man
were
it
only
in
connection
with
the
basest
of
men
would
be
to
blend
all
epics
into
one
superior
and
definitive
epic
conscience
is
the
chaos
of
chimeras
of
lusts
and
of
temptations
the
furnace
of
dreams
the
lair
of
ideas
of
which
we
are
ashamed
it
is
the
pandemonium
of
sophisms
it
is
the
battlefield
of
the
passions
penetrate
at
certain
hours
past
the
livid
face
of
a
human
being
who
is
engaged
in
reflection
and
look
behind
gaze
into
that
soul
gaze
into
that
obscurity
there
beneath
that
external
silence
battles
of
giants
like
those
recorded
in
homer
are
in
progress
skirmishes
of
dragons
and
hydras
and
swarms
of
phantoms
as
in
milton
visionary
circles
as
in
dante
what
a
solemn
thing
is
this
infinity
which
every
man
bears
within
him
and
which
he
measures
with
despair
against
the
caprices
of
his
brain
and
the
actions
of
his
life
alighieri
one
day
met
with
a
sinister
looking
door
before
which
he
hesitated
here
is
one
before
us
upon
whose
threshold
we
hesitate
let
us
enter
nevertheless
we
have
but
little
to
add
to
what
the
reader
already
knows
of
what
had
happened
to
jean
valjean
after
the
adventure
with
little
gervais
from
that
moment
forth
he
was
as
we
have
seen
a
totally
different
man
what
the
bishop
had
wished
to
make
of
him
that
he
carried
out
it
was
more
than
a
transformation
it
was
a
transfiguration
he
succeeded
in
disappearing
sold
the
bishop
s
silver
reserving
only
the
candlesticks
as
a
souvenir
crept
from
town
to
town

france
came
to
m
sur
m
conceived
the
idea
which
we
have
mentioned
accomplished
what
we
have
related
succeeded
in
rendering
himself
safe
from
seizure
and
inaccessible
and
thenceforth
established
at
m
sur
m
happy
in
feeling
his
conscience
saddened
by
the
past
and
the
first
half
of
his
existence
belied
by
the
last
he
lived
in
peace
reassured
and
hopeful
having
henceforth
only
two
thoughts
to
conceal
his
name
and
to
sanctify
his
life
to
escape
men
and
to
return
to
god
these
two
thoughts
were
so
closely
intertwined
in
his
mind
that
they
formed
but
a
single
one
there
both
were
equally
absorbing
and
imperative
and
ruled
his
slightest
actions
in
general
they
conspired
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
his
life
they
turned
him
towards
the
gloom
they
rendered
him
kindly
and
simple
they
counselled
him
to
the
same
things
sometimes
however
they
conflicted
in
that
case
as
the
reader
will
remember
the
man
whom
all
the
country
of
m
sur
m
called
m
madeleine
did
not
hesitate
to
sacrifice
the
first
to
the
second
his
security
to
his
virtue
thus
in
spite
of
all
his
reserve
and
all
his
prudence
he
had
preserved
the
bishop
s
candlesticks
worn
mourning
for
him
summoned
and
interrogated
all
the
little
savoyards
who
passed
that
way
collected
information
regarding
the
families
at
faverolles
and
saved
old
fauchelevent
s
life
despite
the
disquieting
insinuations
of
javert
it
seemed
as
we
have
already
remarked
as
though
he
thought
following
the
example
of
all
those
who
have
been
wise
holy
and
just
that
his
first
duty
was
not
towards
himself
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
confessed
nothing
just
like
this
had
yet
presented
itself
never
had
the
two
ideas
which
governed
the
unhappy
man
whose
sufferings
we
are
narrating
engaged
in
so
serious
a
struggle
he
understood
this
confusedly
but
profoundly
at
the
very
first
words
pronounced
by
javert
when
the
latter
entered
his
study
at
the
moment
when
that
name
which
he
had
buried
beneath
so
many
layers
was
so
strangely
articulated
he
was
struck
with
stupor
and
as
though
intoxicated
with
the
sinister
eccentricity
of
his
destiny
and
through
this
stupor
he
felt
that
shudder
which
precedes
great
shocks
he
bent
like
an
oak
at
the
approach
of
a
storm
like
a
soldier
at
the
approach
of
an
assault
he
felt
shadows
filled
with
thunders
and
lightnings
descending
upon
his
head
as
he
listened
to
javert
the
first
thought
which
occurred
to
him
was
to
go
to
run
and
denounce
himself
to
take
that
champmathieu
out
of
prison
and
place
himself
there
this
was
as
painful
and
as
poignant
as
an
incision
in
the
living
flesh
then
it
passed
away
and
he
said
to
himself
we
will
see
we
will
see
he
repressed
this
first
generous
instinct
and
recoiled
before
heroism
it
would
be
beautiful
no
doubt
after
the
bishop
s
holy
words
after
so
many
years
of
repentance
and
abnegation
in
the
midst
of
a
penitence
admirably
begun
if
this
man
had
not
flinched
for
an
instant
even
in
the
presence
of
so
terrible
a
conjecture
but
had
continued
to
walk
with
the
same
step
towards
this
yawning
precipice
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
heaven
that
would
have
been
beautiful
but
it
was
not
thus
we
must
render
an
account
of
the
things
which
went
on
in
this
soul
and
we
can
only
tell
what
there
was
there
he
was
carried
away
at
first
by
the
instinct
of
self
preservation
he
rallied
all
his
ideas
in
haste
stifled
his
emotions
took
into
consideration
javert
s
presence
that
great
danger
postponed
all
decision
with
the
firmness
of
terror
shook
off
thought
as
to
what
he
had
to
do
and
resumed
his
calmness
as
a
warrior
picks
up
his
buckler
he
remained
in
this
state
during
the
rest
of
the
day
a
whirlwind
within
a
profound
tranquillity
without
he
took
no
preservative
measures
as
they
may
be
called
everything
was
still
confused
and
jostling
together
in
his
brain
his
trouble
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
perceive
the
form
of
a
single
idea
distinctly
and
he
could
have
told
nothing
about
himself
except
that
he
had
received
a
great
blow
he
repaired
to
fantine
s
bed
of
suffering
as
usual
and
prolonged
his
visit
through
a
kindly
instinct
telling
himself
that
he
must
behave
thus
and
recommend
her
well
to
the
sisters
in
case
he
should
be
obliged
to
be
absent
himself
he
had
a
vague
feeling
that
he
might
be
obliged
to
go
to
arras
and
without
having
the
least
in
the
world
made
up
his
mind
to
this
trip
he
said
to
himself
that
being
as
he
was
beyond
the
shadow
of
any
suspicion
there
could
be
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
being
a
witness
to
what
was
to
take
place
and
he
engaged
the
tilbury
from
scaufflaire
in
order
to
be
prepared
in
any
event
he
dined
with
a
good
deal
of
appetite
on
returning
to
his
room
he
communed
with
himself
he
examined
the
situation
and
found
it
unprecedented
so
unprecedented
that
in
the
midst
of
his
revery
he
rose
from
his
chair
moved
by
some
inexplicable
impulse
of
anxiety
and
bolted
his
door
he
feared
lest
something
more
should
enter
he
was
barricading
himself
against
possibilities
a
moment
later
he
extinguished
his
light
it
embarrassed
him
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
might
be
seen
by
whom
alas
that
on
which
he
desired
to
close
the
door
had
already
entered
that
which
he
desired
to
blind
was
staring
him
in
the
face
his
conscience
his
conscience
that
is
to
say
god
nevertheless
he
deluded
himself
at
first
he
had
a
feeling
of
security
and
of
solitude
the
bolt
once
drawn
he
thought
himself
impregnable
the
candle
extinguished
he
felt
himself
invisible
then
he
took
possession
of
himself
he
set
his
elbows
on
the
table
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
began
to
meditate
in
the
dark
where
do
i
stand
am
not
i
dreaming
what
have
i
heard
is
it
really
true
that
i
have
seen
that
javert
and
that
he
spoke
to
me
in
that
manner
who
can
that
champmathieu
be
so
he
resembles
me
is
it
possible
when
i
reflect
that
yesterday
i
was
so
tranquil
and
so
far
from
suspecting
anything
what
was
i
doing
yesterday
at
this
hour
what
is
there
in
this
incident
what
will
the
end
be
what
is
to
be
done
this
was
the
torment
in
which
he
found
himself
his
brain
had
lost
its
power
of
retaining
ideas
they
passed
like
waves
and
he
clutched
his
brow
in
both
hands
to
arrest
them
nothing
but
anguish
extricated
itself
from
this
tumult
which
overwhelmed
his
will
and
his
reason
and
from
which
he
sought
to
draw
proof
and
resolution
his
head
was
burning
he
went
to
the
window
and
threw
it
wide
open
there
were
no
stars
in
the
sky
he
returned
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
the
first
hour
passed
in
this
manner
gradually
however
vague
outlines
began
to
take
form
and
to
fix
themselves
in
his
meditation
and
he
was
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
with
precision
of
the
reality
not
the
whole
situation
but
some
of
the
details
he
began
by
recognizing
the
fact
that
critical
and
extraordinary
as
was
this
situation
he
was
completely
master
of
it
this
only
caused
an
increase
of
his
stupor
independently
of
the
severe
and
religious
aim
which
he
had
assigned
to
his
actions
all
that
he
had
made
up
to
that
day
had
been
nothing
but
a
hole
in
which
to
bury
his
name
that
which
he
had
always
feared
most
of
all
in
his
hours
of
self
communion
during
his
sleepless
nights
was
to
ever
hear
that
name
pronounced
he
had
said
to
himself
that
that
would
be
the
end
of
all
things
for
him
that
on
the
day
when
that
name
made
its
reappearance
it
would
cause
his
new
life
to
vanish
from
about
him
and
who
knows
perhaps
even
his
new
soul
within
him
also
he
shuddered
at
the
very
thought
that
this
was
possible
assuredly
if
any
one
had
said
to
him
at
such
moments
that
the
hour
would
come
when
that
name
would
ring
in
his
ears
when
the
hideous
words
jean
valjean
would
suddenly
emerge
from
the
darkness
and
rise
in
front
of
him
when
that
formidable
light
capable
of
dissipating
the
mystery
in
which
he
had
enveloped
himself
would
suddenly
blaze
forth
above
his
head
and
that
that
name
would
not
menace
him
that
that
light
would
but
produce
an
obscurity
more
dense
that
this
rent
veil
would
but
increase
the
mystery
that
this
earthquake
would
solidify
his
edifice
that
this
prodigious
incident
would
have
no
other
result
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
if
so
it
seemed
good
to
him
than
that
of
rendering
his
existence
at
once
clearer
and
more
impenetrable
and
that
out
of
his
confrontation
with
the
phantom
of
jean
valjean
the
good
and
worthy
citizen
monsieur
madeleine
would
emerge
more
honored
more
peaceful
and
more
respected
than
ever
if
any
one
had
told
him
that
he
would
have
tossed
his
head
and
regarded
the
words
as
those
of
a
madman
well
all
this
was
precisely
what
had
just
come
to
pass
all
that
accumulation
of
impossibilities
was
a
fact
and
god
had
permitted
these
wild
fancies
to
become
real
things
his
revery
continued
to
grow
clearer
he
came
more
and
more
to
an
understanding
of
his
position
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
but
just
waked
up
from
some
inexplicable
dream
and
that
he
found
himself
slipping
down
a
declivity
in
the
middle
of
the
night
erect
shivering
holding
back
all
in
vain
on
the
very
brink
of
the
abyss
he
distinctly
perceived
in
the
darkness
a
stranger
a
man
unknown
to
him
whom
destiny
had
mistaken
for
him
and
whom
she
was
thrusting
into
the
gulf
in
his
stead
in
order
that
the
gulf
might
close
once
more
it
was
necessary
that
some
one
himself
or
that
other
man
should
fall
into
it
he
had
only
let
things
take
their
course
the
light
became
complete
and
he
acknowledged
this
to
himself
that
his
place
was
empty
in
the
galleys
that
do
what
he
would
it
was
still
awaiting
him
that
the
theft
from
little
gervais
had
led
him
back
to
it
that
this
vacant
place
would
await
him
and
draw
him
on
until
he
filled
it
that
this
was
inevitable
and
fatal
and
then
he
said
to
himself
that
at
this
moment
he
had
a
substitute
that
it
appeared
that
a
certain
champmathieu
had
that
ill
luck
and
that
as
regards
himself
being
present
in
the
galleys
in
the
person
of
that
champmathieu
present
in
society
under
the
name
of
m
madeleine
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
provided
that
he
did
not
prevent
men
from
sealing
over
the
head
of
that
champmathieu
this
stone
of
infamy
which
like
the
stone
of
the
sepulchre
falls
once
never
to
rise
again
all
this
was
so
strange
and
so
violent
that
there
suddenly
took
place
in
him
that
indescribable
movement
which
no
man
feels
more
than
two
or
three
times
in
the
course
of
his
life
a
sort
of
convulsion
of
the
conscience
which
stirs
up
all
that
there
is
doubtful
in
the
heart
which
is
composed
of
irony
of
joy
and
of
despair
and
which
may
be
called
an
outburst
of
inward
laughter
he
hastily
relighted
his
candle
well
what
then
he
said
to
himself
what
am
i
afraid
of
what
is
there
in
all
that
for
me
to
think
about
i
am
safe
all
is
over
i
had
but
one
partly
open
door
through
which
my
past
might
invade
my
life
and
behold
that
door
is
walled
up
forever
that
javert
who
has
been
annoying
me
so
long
that
terrible
instinct
which
seemed
to
have
divined
me
which
had
divined
me
good
god
and
which
followed
me
everywhere
that
frightful
hunting
dog
always
making
a
point
at
me
is
thrown
off
the
scent
engaged
elsewhere
absolutely
turned
from
the
trail
henceforth
he
is
satisfied
he
will
leave
me
in
peace
he
has
his
jean
valjean
who
knows
it
is
even
probable
that
he
will
wish
to
leave
town
and
all
this
has
been
brought
about
without
any
aid
from
me
and
i
count
for
nothing
in
it
ah
but
where
is
the
misfortune
in
this
upon
my
honor
people
would
think
to
see
me
that
some
catastrophe
had
happened
to
me
after
all
if
it
does
bring
harm
to
some
one
that
is
not
my
fault
in
the
least
it
is
providence
which
has
done
it
all
it
is
because
it
wishes
it
so
to
be
evidently
have
i
the
right
to
disarrange
what
it
has
arranged
what
do
i
ask
now
why
should
i
meddle
it
does
not
concern
me
what
i
am
not
satisfied
but
what
more
do
i
want
the
goal
to
which
i
have
aspired
for
so
many
years
the
dream
of
my
nights
the
object
of
my
prayers
to
heaven
security
i
have
now
attained
it
is
god
who
wills
it
i
can
do
nothing
against
the
will
of
god
and
why
does
god
will
it
in
order
that
i
may
continue
what
i
have
begun
that
i
may
do
good
that
i
may
one
day
be
a
grand
and
encouraging
example
that
it
may
be
said
at
last
that
a
little
happiness
has
been
attached
to
the
penance
which
i
have
undergone
and
to
that
virtue
to
which
i
have
returned
really
i
do
not
understand
why
i
was
afraid
a
little
while
ago
to
enter
the
house
of
that
good
cure
and
to
ask
his
advice
this
is
evidently
what
he
would
have
said
to
me
it
is
settled
let
things
take
their
course
let
the
good
god
do
as
he
likes
thus
did
he
address
himself
in
the
depths
of
his
own
conscience
bending
over
what
may
be
called
his
own
abyss
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
began
to
pace
the
room
come
said
he
let
us
think
no
more
about
it
my
resolve
is
taken
but
he
felt
no
joy
quite
the
reverse
one
can
no
more
prevent
thought
from
recurring
to
an
idea
than
one
can
the
sea
from
returning
to
the
shore
the
sailor
calls
it
the
tide
the
guilty
man
calls
it
remorse
god
upheaves
the
soul
as
he
does
the
ocean
after
the
expiration
of
a
few
moments
do
what
he
would
he
resumed
the
gloomy
dialogue
in
which
it
was
he
who
spoke
and
he
who
listened
saying
that
which
he
would
have
preferred
to
ignore
and
listened
to
that
which
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
hear
yielding
to
that
mysterious
power
which
said
to
him
think
as
it
said
to
another
condemned
man
two
thousand
years
ago
march
on
before
proceeding
further
and
in
order
to
make
ourselves
fully
understood
let
us
insist
upon
one
necessary
observation
it
is
certain
that
people
do
talk
to
themselves
there
is
no
living
being
who
has
not
done
it
it
may
even
be
said
that
the
word
is
never
a
more
magnificent
mystery
than
when
it
goes
from
thought
to
conscience
within
a
man
and
when
it
returns
from
conscience
to
thought
it
is
in
this
sense
only
that
the
words
so
often
employed
in
this
chapter
he
said
he
exclaimed
must
be
understood
one
speaks
to
one
s
self
talks
to
one
s
self
exclaims
to
one
s
self
without
breaking
the
external
silence
there
is
a
great
tumult
everything
about
us
talks
except
the
mouth
the
realities
of
the
soul
are
none
the
less
realities
because
they
are
not
visible
and
palpable
so
he
asked
himself
where
he
stood
he
interrogated
himself
upon
that
settled
resolve
he
confessed
to
himself
that
all
that
he
had
just
arranged
in
his
mind
was
monstrous
that
to
let
things
take
their
course
to
let
the
good
god
do
as
he
liked
was
simply
horrible
to
allow
this
error
of
fate
and
of
men
to
be
carried
out
not
to
hinder
it
to
lend
himself
to
it
through
his
silence
to
do
nothing
in
short
was
to
do
everything
that
this
was
hypocritical
baseness
in
the
last
degree
that
it
was
a
base
cowardly
sneaking
abject
hideous
crime
for
the
first
time
in
eight
years
the
wretched
man
had
just
tasted
the
bitter
savor
of
an
evil
thought
and
of
an
evil
action
he
spit
it
out
with
disgust
he
continued
to
question
himself
he
asked
himself
severely
what
he
had
meant
by
this
my
object
is
attained
he
declared
to
himself
that
his
life
really
had
an
object
but
what
object
to
conceal
his
name
to
deceive
the
police
was
it
for
so
petty
a
thing
that
he
had
done
all
that
he
had
done
had
he
not
another
and
a
grand
object
which
was
the
true
one
to
save
not
his
person
but
his
soul
to
become
honest
and
good
once
more
to
be
a
just
man
was
it
not
that
above
all
that
alone
which
he
had
always
desired
which
the
bishop
had
enjoined
upon
him
to
shut
the
door
on
his
past
but
he
was
not
shutting
it
great
god
he
was
re
opening
it
by
committing
an
infamous
action
he
was
becoming
a
thief
once
more
and
the
most
odious
of
thieves
he
was
robbing
another
of
his
existence
his
life
his
peace
his
place
in
the
sunshine
he
was
becoming
an
assassin
he
was
murdering
morally
murdering
a
wretched
man
he
was
inflicting
on
him
that
frightful
living
death
that
death
beneath
the
open
sky
which
is
called
the
galleys
on
the
other
hand
to
surrender
himself
to
save
that
man
struck
down
with
so
melancholy
an
error
to
resume
his
own
name
to
become
once
more
out
of
duty
the
convict
jean
valjean
that
was
in
truth
to
achieve
his
resurrection
and
to
close
forever
that
hell
whence
he
had
just
emerged
to
fall
back
there
in
appearance
was
to
escape
from
it
in
reality
this
must
be
done
he
had
done
nothing
if
he
did
not
do
all
this
his
whole
life
was
useless
all
his
penitence
was
wasted
there
was
no
longer
any
need
of
saying
what
is
the
use
he
felt
that
the
bishop
was
there
that
the
bishop
was
present
all
the
more
because
he
was
dead
that
the
bishop
was
gazing
fixedly
at
him
that
henceforth
mayor
madeleine
with
all
his
virtues
would
be
abominable
to
him
and
that
the
convict
jean
valjean
would
be
pure
and
admirable
in
his
sight
that
men
beheld
his
mask
but
that
the
bishop
saw
his
face
that
men
saw
his
life
but
that
the
bishop
beheld
his
conscience
so
he
must
go
to
arras
deliver
the
false
jean
valjean
and
denounce
the
real
one
alas
that
was
the
greatest
of
sacrifices
the
most
poignant
of
victories
the
last
step
to
take
but
it
must
be
done
sad
fate
he
would
enter
into
sanctity
only
in
the
eyes
of
god
when
he
returned
to
infamy
in
the
eyes
of
men
well
said
he
let
us
decide
upon
this
let
us
do
our
duty
let
us
save
this
man
he
uttered
these
words
aloud
without
perceiving
that
he
was
speaking
aloud
he
took
his
books
verified
them
and
put
them
in
order
he
flung
in
the
fire
a
bundle
of
bills
which
he
had
against
petty
and
embarrassed
tradesmen
he
wrote
and
sealed
a
letter
and
on
the
envelope
it
might
have
been
read
had
there
been
any
one
in
his
chamber
at
the
moment
to
monsieur
laffitte
banker
rue
d
artois
paris
he
drew
from
his
secretary
a
pocket
book
which
contained
several
bank
notes
and
the
passport
of
which
he
had
made
use
that
same
year
when
he
went
to
the
elections
any
one
who
had
seen
him
during
the
execution
of
these
various
acts
into
which
there
entered
such
grave
thought
would
have
had
no
suspicion
of
what
was
going
on
within
him
only
occasionally
did
his
lips
move
at
other
times
he
raised
his
head
and
fixed
his
gaze
upon
some
point
of
the
wall
as
though
there
existed
at
that
point
something
which
he
wished
to
elucidate
or
interrogate
when
he
had
finished
the
letter
to
m
laffitte
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
together
with
the
pocket
book
and
began
his
walk
once
more
his
revery
had
not
swerved
from
its
course
he
continued
to
see
his
duty
clearly
written
in
luminous
letters
which
flamed
before
his
eyes
and
changed
its
place
as
he
altered
the
direction
of
his
glance
go
tell
your
name
denounce
yourself
in
the
same
way
he
beheld
as
though
they
had
passed
before
him
in
visible
forms
the
two
ideas
which
had
up
to
that
time
formed
the
double
rule
of
his
soul
the
concealment
of
his
name
the
sanctification
of
his
life
for
the
first
time
they
appeared
to
him
as
absolutely
distinct
and
he
perceived
the
distance
which
separated
them
he
recognized
the
fact
that
one
of
these
ideas
was
necessarily
good
while
the
other
might
become
bad
that
the
first
was
self
devotion
and
that
the
other
was
personality
that
the
one
said
my
neighbor
and
that
the
other
said
myself
that
one
emanated
from
the
light
and
the
other
from
darkness
they
were
antagonistic
he
saw
them
in
conflict
in
proportion
as
he
meditated
they
grew
before
the
eyes
of
his
spirit
they
had
now
attained
colossal
statures
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
beheld
within
himself
in
that
infinity
of
which
we
were
recently
speaking
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
and
the
lights
a
goddess
and
a
giant
contending
he
was
filled
with
terror
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
good
thought
was
getting
the
upper
hand
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
the
second
decisive
crisis
of
his
conscience
and
of
his
destiny
that
the
bishop
had
marked
the
first
phase
of
his
new
life
and
that
champmathieu
marked
the
second
after
the
grand
crisis
the
grand
test
but
the
fever
allayed
for
an
instant
gradually
resumed
possession
of
him
a
thousand
thoughts
traversed
his
mind
but
they
continued
to
fortify
him
in
his
resolution
one
moment
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
perhaps
taking
the
matter
too
keenly
that
after
all
this
champmathieu
was
not
interesting
and
that
he
had
actually
been
guilty
of
theft
he
answered
himself
if
this
man
has
indeed
stolen
a
few
apples
that
means
a
month
in
prison
it
is
a
long
way
from
that
to
the
galleys
and
who
knows
did
he
steal
has
it
been
proved
the
name
of
jean
valjean
overwhelms
him
and
seems
to
dispense
with
proofs
do
not
the
attorneys
for
the
crown
always
proceed
in
this
manner
he
is
supposed
to
be
a
thief
because
he
is
known
to
be
a
convict
in
another
instant
the
thought
had
occurred
to
him
that
when
he
denounced
himself
the
heroism
of
his
deed
might
perhaps
be
taken
into
consideration
and
his
honest
life
for
the
last
seven
years
and
what
he
had
done
for
the
district
and
that
they
would
have
mercy
on
him
but
this
supposition
vanished
very
quickly
and
he
smiled
bitterly
as
he
remembered
that
the
theft
of
the
forty
sous
from
little
gervais
put
him
in
the
position
of
a
man
guilty
of
a
second
offence
after
conviction
that
this
affair
would
certainly
come
up
and
according
to
the
precise
terms
of
the
law
would
render
him
liable
to
penal
servitude
for
life
he
turned
aside
from
all
illusions
detached
himself
more
and
more
from
earth
and
sought
strength
and
consolation
elsewhere
he
told
himself
that
he
must
do
his
duty
that
perhaps
he
should
not
be
more
unhappy
after
doing
his
duty
than
after
having
avoided
it
that
if
he
allowed
things
to
take
their
own
course
if
he
remained
at
m
sur
m
his
consideration
his
good
name
his
good
works
the
deference
and
veneration
paid
to
him
his
charity
his
wealth
his
popularity
his
virtue
would
be
seasoned
with
a
crime
and
what
would
be
the
taste
of
all
these
holy
things
when
bound
up
with
this
hideous
thing
while
if
he
accomplished
his
sacrifice
a
celestial
idea
would
be
mingled
with
the
galleys
the
post
the
iron
necklet
the
green
cap
unceasing
toil
and
pitiless
shame
at
length
he
told
himself
that
it
must
be
so
that
his
destiny
was
thus
allotted
that
he
had
not
authority
to
alter
the
arrangements
made
on
high
that
in
any
case
he
must
make
his
choice
virtue
without
and
abomination
within
or
holiness
within
and
infamy
without
the
stirring
up
of
these
lugubrious
ideas
did
not
cause
his
courage
to
fail
but
his
brain
grow
weary
he
began
to
think
of
other
things
of
indifferent
matters
in
spite
of
himself
the
veins
in
his
temples
throbbed
violently
he
still
paced
to
and
fro
midnight
sounded
first
from
the
parish
church
then
from
the
town
hall
he
counted
the
twelve
strokes
of
the
two
clocks
and
compared
the
sounds
of
the
two
bells
he
recalled
in
this
connection
the
fact
that
a
few
days
previously
he
had
seen
in
an
ironmonger
s
shop
an
ancient
clock
for
sale
upon
which
was
written
the
name
antoine
albin
de
romainville
he
was
cold
he
lighted
a
small
fire
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
close
the
window
in
the
meantime
he
had
relapsed
into
his
stupor
he
was
obliged
to
make
a
tolerably
vigorous
effort
to
recall
what
had
been
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
before
midnight
had
struck
he
finally
succeeded
in
doing
this
ah
yes
he
said
to
himself
i
had
resolved
to
inform
against
myself
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
thought
of
fantine
hold
said
he
and
what
about
that
poor
woman
here
a
fresh
crisis
declared
itself
fantine
by
appearing
thus
abruptly
in
his
revery
produced
the
effect
of
an
unexpected
ray
of
light
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
everything
about
him
were
undergoing
a
change
of
aspect
he
exclaimed
ah
but
i
have
hitherto
considered
no
one
but
myself
it
is
proper
for
me
to
hold
my
tongue
or
to
denounce
myself
to
conceal
my
person
or
to
save
my
soul
to
be
a
despicable
and
respected
magistrate
or
an
infamous
and
venerable
convict
it
is
i
it
is
always
i
and
nothing
but
i
but
good
god
all
this
is
egotism
these
are
diverse
forms
of
egotism
but
it
is
egotism
all
the
same
what
if
i
were
to
think
a
little
about
others
the
highest
holiness
is
to
think
of
others
come
let
us
examine
the
matter
the
i
excepted
the
i
effaced
the
i
forgotten
what
would
be
the
result
of
all
this
what
if
i
denounce
myself
i
am
arrested
this
champmathieu
is
released
i
am
put
back
in
the
galleys
that
is
well
and
what
then
what
is
going
on
here
ah
here
is
a
country
a
town
here
are
factories
an
industry
workers
both
men
and
women
aged
grandsires
children
poor
people
all
this
i
have
created
all
these
i
provide
with
their
living
everywhere
where
there
is
a
smoking
chimney
it
is
i
who
have
placed
the
brand
on
the
hearth
and
meat
in
the
pot
i
have
created
ease
circulation
credit
before
me
there
was
nothing
i
have
elevated
vivified
informed
with
life
fecundated
stimulated
enriched
the
whole
country
side
lacking
me
the
soul
is
lacking
i
take
myself
off
everything
dies
and
this
woman
who
has
suffered
so
much
who
possesses
so
many
merits
in
spite
of
her
fall
the
cause
of
all
whose
misery
i
have
unwittingly
been
and
that
child
whom
i
meant
to
go
in
search
of
whom
i
have
promised
to
her
mother
do
i
not
also
owe
something
to
this
woman
in
reparation
for
the
evil
which
i
have
done
her
if
i
disappear
what
happens
the
mother
dies
the
child
becomes
what
it
can
that
is
what
will
take
place
if
i
denounce
myself
if
i
do
not
denounce
myself
come
let
us
see
how
it
will
be
if
i
do
not
denounce
myself
after
putting
this
question
to
himself
he
paused
he
seemed
to
undergo
a
momentary
hesitation
and
trepidation
but
it
did
not
last
long
and
he
answered
himself
calmly
well
this
man
is
going
to
the
galleys
it
is
true
but
what
the
deuce
he
has
stolen
there
is
no
use
in
my
saying
that
he
has
not
been
guilty
of
theft
for
he
has
i
remain
here
i
go
on
in
ten
years
i
shall
have
made
ten
millions
i
scatter
them
over
the
country
i
have
nothing
of
my
own
what
is
that
to
me
it
is
not
for
myself
that
i
am
doing
it
the
prosperity
of
all
goes
on
augmenting
industries
are
aroused
and
animated
factories
and
shops
are
multiplied
families
a
hundred
families
a
thousand
families
are
happy
the
district
becomes
populated
villages
spring
up
where
there
were
only
farms
before
farms
rise
where
there
was
nothing
wretchedness
disappears
and
with
wretchedness
debauchery
prostitution
theft
murder
all
vices
disappear
all
crimes
and
this
poor
mother
rears
her
child
and
behold
a
whole
country
rich
and
honest
ah
i
was
a
fool
i
was
absurd
what
was
that
i
was
saying
about
denouncing
myself
i
really
must
pay
attention
and
not
be
precipitate
about
anything
what
because
it
would
have
pleased
me
to
play
the
grand
and
generous
this
is
melodrama
after
all
because
i
should
have
thought
of
no
one
but
myself
the
idea
for
the
sake
of
saving
from
a
punishment
a
trifle
exaggerated
perhaps
but
just
at
bottom
no
one
knows
whom
a
thief
a
good
for
nothing
evidently
a
whole
country
side
must
perish
a
poor
woman
must
die
in
the
hospital
a
poor
little
girl
must
die
in
the
street
like
dogs
ah
this
is
abominable
and
without
the
mother
even
having
seen
her
child
once
more
almost
without
the
child
s
having
known
her
mother
and
all
that
for
the
sake
of
an
old
wretch
of
an
apple
thief
who
most
assuredly
has
deserved
the
galleys
for
something
else
if
not
for
that
fine
scruples
indeed
which
save
a
guilty
man
and
sacrifice
the
innocent
which
save
an
old
vagabond
who
has
only
a
few
years
to
live
at
most
and
who
will
not
be
more
unhappy
in
the
galleys
than
in
his
hovel
and
which
sacrifice
a
whole
population
mothers
wives
children
this
poor
little
cosette
who
has
no
one
in
the
world
but
me
and
who
is
no
doubt
blue
with
cold
at
this
moment
in
the
den
of
those
thenardiers
those
peoples
are
rascals
and
i
was
going
to
neglect
my
duty
towards
all
these
poor
creatures
and
i
was
going
off
to
denounce
myself
and
i
was
about
to
commit
that
unspeakable
folly
let
us
put
it
at
the
worst
suppose
that
there
is
a
wrong
action
on
my
part
in
this
and
that
my
conscience
will
reproach
me
for
it
some
day
to
accept
for
the
good
of
others
these
reproaches
which
weigh
only
on
myself
this
evil
action
which
compromises
my
soul
alone
in
that
lies
self
sacrifice
in
that
alone
there
is
virtue
he
rose
and
resumed
his
march
this
time
he
seemed
to
be
content
diamonds
are
found
only
in
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
truths
are
found
only
in
the
depths
of
thought
it
seemed
to
him
that
after
having
descended
into
these
depths
after
having
long
groped
among
the
darkest
of
these
shadows
he
had
at
last
found
one
of
these
diamonds
one
of
these
truths
and
that
he
now
held
it
in
his
hand
and
he
was
dazzled
as
he
gazed
upon
it
yes
he
thought
this
is
right
i
am
on
the
right
road
i
have
the
solution
i
must
end
by
holding
fast
to
something
my
resolve
is
taken
let
things
take
their
course
let
us
no
longer
vacillate
let
us
no
longer
hang
back
this
is
for
the
interest
of
all
not
for
my
own
i
am
madeleine
and
madeleine
i
remain
woe
to
the
man
who
is
jean
valjean
i
am
no
longer
he
i
do
not
know
that
man
i
no
longer
know
anything
it
turns
out
that
some
one
is
jean
valjean
at
the
present
moment
let
him
look
out
for
himself
that
does
not
concern
me
it
is
a
fatal
name
which
was
floating
abroad
in
the
night
if
it
halts
and
descends
on
a
head
so
much
the
worse
for
that
head
he
looked
into
the
little
mirror
which
hung
above
his
chimney
piece
and
said
hold
it
has
relieved
me
to
come
to
a
decision
i
am
quite
another
man
now
he
proceeded
a
few
paces
further
then
he
stopped
short
come
he
said
i
must
not
flinch
before
any
of
the
consequences
of
the
resolution
which
i
have
once
adopted
there
are
still
threads
which
attach
me
to
that
jean
valjean
they
must
be
broken
in
this
very
room
there
are
objects
which
would
betray
me
dumb
things
which
would
bear
witness
against
me
it
is
settled
all
these
things
must
disappear
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
drew
out
his
purse
opened
it
and
took
out
a
small
key
he
inserted
the
key
in
a
lock
whose
aperture
could
hardly
be
seen
so
hidden
was
it
in
the
most
sombre
tones
of
the
design
which
covered
the
wall
paper
a
secret
receptacle
opened
a
sort
of
false
cupboard
constructed
in
the
angle
between
the
wall
and
the
chimney
piece
in
this
hiding
place
there
were
some
rags
a
blue
linen
blouse
an
old
pair
of
trousers
an
old
knapsack
and
a
huge
thorn
cudgel
shod
with
iron
at
both
ends
those
who
had
seen
jean
valjean
at
the
epoch
when
he
passed
through
d
in
october
1815
could
easily
have
recognized
all
the
pieces
of
this
miserable
outfit
he
had
preserved
them
as
he
had
preserved
the
silver
candlesticks
in
order
to
remind
himself
continually
of
his
starting
point
but
he
had
concealed
all
that
came
from
the
galleys
and
he
had
allowed
the
candlesticks
which
came
from
the
bishop
to
be
seen
he
cast
a
furtive
glance
towards
the
door
as
though
he
feared
that
it
would
open
in
spite
of
the
bolt
which
fastened
it
then
with
a
quick
and
abrupt
movement
he
took
the
whole
in
his
arms
at
once
without
bestowing
so
much
as
a
glance
on
the
things
which
he
had
so
religiously
and
so
perilously
preserved
for
so
many
years
and
flung
them
all
rags
cudgel
knapsack
into
the
fire
illustration
candlesticks
into
the
fire
1b7

into
the
fire
he
closed
the
false
cupboard
again
and
with
redoubled
precautions
henceforth
unnecessary
since
it
was
now
empty
he
concealed
the
door
behind
a
heavy
piece
of
furniture
which
he
pushed
in
front
of
it
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
seconds
the
room
and
the
opposite
wall
were
lighted
up
with
a
fierce
red
tremulous
glow
everything
was
on
fire
the
thorn
cudgel
snapped
and
threw
out
sparks
to
the
middle
of
the
chamber
as
the
knapsack
was
consumed
together
with
the
hideous
rags
which
it
contained
it
revealed
something
which
sparkled
in
the
ashes
by
bending
over
one
could
have
readily
recognized
a
coin
no
doubt
the
forty
sou
piece
stolen
from
the
little
savoyard
he
did
not
look
at
the
fire
but
paced
back
and
forth
with
the
same
step
all
at
once
his
eye
fell
on
the
two
silver
candlesticks
which
shone
vaguely
on
the
chimney
piece
through
the
glow
hold
he
thought
the
whole
of
jean
valjean
is
still
in
them
they
must
be
destroyed
also
he
seized
the
two
candlesticks
there
was
still
fire
enough
to
allow
of
their
being
put
out
of
shape
and
converted
into
a
sort
of
unrecognizable
bar
of
metal
he
bent
over
the
hearth
and
warmed
himself
for
a
moment
he
felt
a
sense
of
real
comfort
how
good
warmth
is
said
he
he
stirred
the
live
coals
with
one
of
the
candlesticks
a
minute
more
and
they
were
both
in
the
fire
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
a
voice
within
him
shouting
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
his
hair
rose
upright
he
became
like
a
man
who
is
listening
to
some
terrible
thing
yes
that
s
it
finish
said
the
voice
complete
what
you
are
about
destroy
these
candlesticks
annihilate
this
souvenir
forget
the
bishop
forget
everything
destroy
this
champmathieu
do
that
is
right
applaud
yourself
so
it
is
settled
resolved
fixed
agreed
here
is
an
old
man
who
does
not
know
what
is
wanted
of
him
who
has
perhaps
done
nothing
an
innocent
man
whose
whole
misfortune
lies
in
your
name
upon
whom
your
name
weighs
like
a
crime
who
is
about
to
be
taken
for
you
who
will
be
condemned
who
will
finish
his
days
in
abjectness
and
horror
that
is
good
be
an
honest
man
yourself
remain
monsieur
le
maire
remain
honorable
and
honored
enrich
the
town
nourish
the
indigent
rear
the
orphan
live
happy
virtuous
and
admired
and
during
this
time
while
you
are
here
in
the
midst
of
joy
and
light
there
will
be
a
man
who
will
wear
your
red
blouse
who
will
bear
your
name
in
ignominy
and
who
will
drag
your
chain
in
the
galleys
yes
it
is
well
arranged
thus
ah
wretch
the
perspiration
streamed
from
his
brow
he
fixed
a
haggard
eye
on
the
candlesticks
but
that
within
him
which
had
spoken
had
not
finished
the
voice
continued
jean
valjean
there
will
be
around
you
many
voices
which
will
make
a
great
noise
which
will
talk
very
loud
and
which
will
bless
you
and
only
one
which
no
one
will
hear
and
which
will
curse
you
in
the
dark
well
listen
infamous
man
all
those
benedictions
will
fall
back
before
they
reach
heaven
and
only
the
malediction
will
ascend
to
god
this
voice
feeble
at
first
and
which
had
proceeded
from
the
most
obscure
depths
of
his
conscience
had
gradually
become
startling
and
formidable
and
he
now
heard
it
in
his
very
ear
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
had
detached
itself
from
him
and
that
it
was
now
speaking
outside
of
him
he
thought
that
he
heard
the
last
words
so
distinctly
that
he
glanced
around
the
room
in
a
sort
of
terror
is
there
any
one
here
he
demanded
aloud
in
utter
bewilderment
then
he
resumed
with
a
laugh
which
resembled
that
of
an
idiot
how
stupid
i
am
there
can
be
no
one
there
was
some
one
but
the
person
who
was
there
was
of
those
whom
the
human
eye
cannot
see
he
placed
the
candlesticks
on
the
chimney
piece
then
he
resumed
his
monotonous
and
lugubrious
tramp
which
troubled
the
dreams
of
the
sleeping
man
beneath
him
and
awoke
him
with
a
start
this
tramping
to
and
fro
soothed
and
at
the
same
time
intoxicated
him
it
sometimes
seems
on
supreme
occasions
as
though
people
moved
about
for
the
purpose
of
asking
advice
of
everything
that
they
may
encounter
by
change
of
place
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
he
no
longer
knew
his
position
he
now
recoiled
in
equal
terror
before
both
the
resolutions
at
which
he
had
arrived
in
turn
the
two
ideas
which
counselled
him
appeared
to
him
equally
fatal
what
a
fatality
what
conjunction
that
that
champmathieu
should
have
been
taken
for
him
to
be
overwhelmed
by
precisely
the
means
which
providence
seemed
to
have
employed
at
first
to
strengthen
his
position
there
was
a
moment
when
he
reflected
on
the
future
denounce
himself
great
god
deliver
himself
up
with
immense
despair
he
faced
all
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
leave
all
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
take
up
once
more
he
should
have
to
bid
farewell
to
that
existence
which
was
so
good
so
pure
so
radiant
to
the
respect
of
all
to
honor
to
liberty
he
should
never
more
stroll
in
the
fields
he
should
never
more
hear
the
birds
sing
in
the
month
of
may
he
should
never
more
bestow
alms
on
the
little
children
he
should
never
more
experience
the
sweetness
of
having
glances
of
gratitude
and
love
fixed
upon
him
he
should
quit
that
house
which
he
had
built
that
little
chamber
everything
seemed
charming
to
him
at
that
moment
never
again
should
he
read
those
books
never
more
should
he
write
on
that
little
table
of
white
wood
his
old
portress
the
only
servant
whom
he
kept
would
never
more
bring
him
his
coffee
in
the
morning
great
god
instead
of
that
the
convict
gang
the
iron
necklet
the
red
waistcoat
the
chain
on
his
ankle
fatigue
the
cell
the
camp
bed
all
those
horrors
which
he
knew
so
well
at
his
age
after
having
been
what
he
was
if
he
were
only
young
again
but
to
be
addressed
in
his
old
age
as
thou
by
any
one
who
pleased
to
be
searched
by
the
convict
guard
to
receive
the
galley
sergeant
s
cudgellings
to
wear
iron
bound
shoes
on
his
bare
feet
to
have
to
stretch
out
his
leg
night
and
morning
to
the
hammer
of
the
roundsman
who
visits
the
gang
to
submit
to
the
curiosity
of
strangers
who
would
be
told
that
man
yonder
is
the
famous
jean
valjean
who
was
mayor
of
m
sur
m
and
at
night
dripping
with
perspiration
overwhelmed
with
lassitude
their
green
caps
drawn
over
their
eyes
to
remount
two
by
two
the
ladder
staircase
of
the
galleys
beneath
the
sergeant
s
whip
oh
what
misery
can
destiny
then
be
as
malicious
as
an
intelligent
being
and
become
as
monstrous
as
the
human
heart
and
do
what
he
would
he
always
fell
back
upon
the
heartrending
dilemma
which
lay
at
the
foundation
of
his
revery
should
he
remain
in
paradise
and
become
a
demon
should
he
return
to
hell
and
become
an
angel
what
was
to
be
done
great
god
what
was
to
be
done
the
torment
from
which
he
had
escaped
with
so
much
difficulty
was
unchained
afresh
within
him
his
ideas
began
to
grow
confused
once
more
they
assumed
a
kind
of
stupefied
and
mechanical
quality
which
is
peculiar
to
despair
the
name
of
romainville
recurred
incessantly
to
his
mind
with
the
two
verses
of
a
song
which
he
had
heard
in
the
past
he
thought
that
romainville
was
a
little
grove
near
paris
where
young
lovers
go
to
pluck
lilacs
in
the
month
of
april
he
wavered
outwardly
as
well
as
inwardly
he
walked
like
a
little
child
who
is
permitted
to
toddle
alone
at
intervals
as
he
combated
his
lassitude
he
made
an
effort
to
recover
the
mastery
of
his
mind
he
tried
to
put
to
himself
for
the
last
time
and
definitely
the
problem
over
which
he
had
in
a
manner
fallen
prostrate
with
fatigue
ought
he
to
denounce
himself
ought
he
to
hold
his
peace
he
could
not
manage
to
see
anything
distinctly
the
vague
aspects
of
all
the
courses
of
reasoning
which
had
been
sketched
out
by
his
meditations
quivered
and
vanished
one
after
the
other
into
smoke
he
only
felt
that
to
whatever
course
of
action
he
made
up
his
mind
something
in
him
must
die
and
that
of
necessity
and
without
his
being
able
to
escape
the
fact
that
he
was
entering
a
sepulchre
on
the
right
hand
as
much
as
on
the
left
that
he
was
passing
through
a
death
agony
the
agony
of
his
happiness
or
the
agony
of
his
virtue
alas
all
his
resolution
had
again
taken
possession
of
him
he
was
no
further
advanced
than
at
the
beginning
thus
did
this
unhappy
soul
struggle
in
its
anguish
eighteen
hundred
years
before
this
unfortunate
man
the
mysterious
being
in
whom
are
summed
up
all
the
sanctities
and
all
the
sufferings
of
humanity
had
also
long
thrust
aside
with
his
hand
while
the
olive
trees
quivered
in
the
wild
wind
of
the
infinite
the
terrible
cup
which
appeared
to
him
dripping
with
darkness
and
overflowing
with
shadows
in
the
depths
all
studded
with
stars
chapter
iv
forms
assumed
by
suffering
during
sleep
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
had
just
struck
and
he
had
been
walking
thus
for
five
hours
almost
uninterruptedly
when
he
at
length
allowed
himself
to
drop
into
his
chair
there
he
fell
asleep
and
had
a
dream
this
dream
like
the
majority
of
dreams
bore
no
relation
to
the
situation
except
by
its
painful
and
heart
rending
character
but
it
made
an
impression
on
him
this
nightmare
struck
him
so
forcibly
that
he
wrote
it
down
later
on
it
is
one
of
the
papers
in
his
own
handwriting
which
he
has
bequeathed
to
us
we
think
that
we
have
here
reproduced
the
thing
in
strict
accordance
with
the
text
of
whatever
nature
this
dream
may
be
the
history
of
this
night
would
be
incomplete
if
we
were
to
omit
it
it
is
the
gloomy
adventure
of
an
ailing
soul
here
it
is
on
the
envelope
we
find
this
line
inscribed
the
dream
i
had
that
night
i
was
in
a
plain
a
vast
gloomy
plain
where
there
was
no
grass
it
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
daylight
nor
yet
night
i
was
walking
with
my
brother
the
brother
of
my
childish
years
the
brother
of
whom
i
must
say
i
never
think
and
whom
i
now
hardly
remember
we
were
conversing
and
we
met
some
passers
by
we
were
talking
of
a
neighbor
of
ours
in
former
days
who
had
always
worked
with
her
window
open
from
the
time
when
she
came
to
live
on
the
street
as
we
talked
we
felt
cold
because
of
that
open
window
there
were
no
trees
in
the
plain
we
saw
a
man
passing
close
to
us
he
was
entirely
nude
of
the
hue
of
ashes
and
mounted
on
a
horse
which
was
earth
color
the
man
had
no
hair
we
could
see
his
skull
and
the
veins
on
it
in
his
hand
he
held
a
switch
which
was
as
supple
as
a
vine
shoot
and
as
heavy
as
iron
this
horseman
passed
and
said
nothing
to
us
my
brother
said
to
me
let
us
take
to
the
hollow
road
there
existed
a
hollow
way
wherein
one
saw
neither
a
single
shrub
nor
a
spear
of
moss
everything
was
dirt
colored
even
the
sky
after
proceeding
a
few
paces
i
received
no
reply
when
i
spoke
i
perceived
that
my
brother
was
no
longer
with
me
i
entered
a
village
which
i
espied
i
reflected
that
it
must
be
romainville
why
romainville
5
the
first
street
that
i
entered
was
deserted
i
entered
a
second
street
behind
the
angle
formed
by
the
two
streets
a
man
was
standing
erect
against
the
wall
i
said
to
this
man
what
country
is
this
where
am
i
the
man
made
no
reply
i
saw
the
door
of
a
house
open
and
i
entered
the
first
chamber
was
deserted
i
entered
the
second
behind
the
door
of
this
chamber
a
man
was
standing
erect
against
the
wall
i
inquired
of
this
man
whose
house
is
this
where
am
i
the
man
replied
not
the
house
had
a
garden
i
quitted
the
house
and
entered
the
garden
the
garden
was
deserted
behind
the
first
tree
i
found
a
man
standing
upright
i
said
to
this
man
what
garden
is
this
where
am
i
the
man
did
not
answer
i
strolled
into
the
village
and
perceived
that
it
was
a
town
all
the
streets
were
deserted
all
the
doors
were
open
not
a
single
living
being
was
passing
in
the
streets
walking
through
the
chambers
or
strolling
in
the
gardens
but
behind
each
angle
of
the
walls
behind
each
door
behind
each
tree
stood
a
silent
man
only
one
was
to
be
seen
at
a
time
these
men
watched
me
pass
i
left
the
town
and
began
to
ramble
about
the
fields
after
the
lapse
of
some
time
i
turned
back
and
saw
a
great
crowd
coming
up
behind
me
i
recognized
all
the
men
whom
i
had
seen
in
that
town
they
had
strange
heads
they
did
not
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
yet
they
walked
faster
than
i
did
they
made
no
noise
as
they
walked
in
an
instant
this
crowd
had
overtaken
and
surrounded
me
the
faces
of
these
men
were
earthen
in
hue
then
the
first
one
whom
i
had
seen
and
questioned
on
entering
the
town
said
to
me
whither
are
you
going
do
you
not
know
that
you
have
been
dead
this
long
time
i
opened
my
mouth
to
reply
and
i
perceived
that
there
was
no
one
near
me
he
woke
he
was
icy
cold
a
wind
which
was
chill
like
the
breeze
of
dawn
was
rattling
the
leaves
of
the
window
which
had
been
left
open
on
their
hinges
the
fire
was
out
the
candle
was
nearing
its
end
it
was
still
black
night
he
rose
he
went
to
the
window
there
were
no
stars
in
the
sky
even
yet
from
his
window
the
yard
of
the
house
and
the
street
were
visible
a
sharp
harsh
noise
which
made
him
drop
his
eyes
resounded
from
the
earth
below
him
he
perceived
two
red
stars
whose
rays
lengthened
and
shortened
in
a
singular
manner
through
the
darkness
as
his
thoughts
were
still
half
immersed
in
the
mists
of
sleep
hold
said
he
there
are
no
stars
in
the
sky
they
are
on
earth
now
but
this
confusion
vanished
a
second
sound
similar
to
the
first
roused
him
thoroughly
he
looked
and
recognized
the
fact
that
these
two
stars
were
the
lanterns
of
a
carriage
by
the
light
which
they
cast
he
was
able
to
distinguish
the
form
of
this
vehicle
it
was
a
tilbury
harnessed
to
a
small
white
horse
the
noise
which
he
had
heard
was
the
trampling
of
the
horse
s
hoofs
on
the
pavement
what
vehicle
is
this
he
said
to
himself
who
is
coming
here
so
early
in
the
morning
at
that
moment
there
came
a
light
tap
on
the
door
of
his
chamber
he
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
and
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
who
is
there
some
one
said
i
monsieur
le
maire
he
recognized
the
voice
of
the
old
woman
who
was
his
portress
well
he
replied
what
is
it
monsieur
le
maire
it
is
just
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
what
is
that
to
me
the
cabriolet
is
here
monsieur
le
maire
what
cabriolet
the
tilbury
what
tilbury
did
not
monsieur
le
maire
order
a
tilbury
no
said
he
the
coachman
says
that
he
has
come
for
monsieur
le
maire
what
coachman
m
scaufflaire
s
coachman
m
scaufflaire
that
name
sent
a
shudder
over
him
as
though
a
flash
of
lightning
had
passed
in
front
of
his
face
ah
yes
he
resumed
m
scaufflaire
if
the
old
woman
could
have
seen
him
at
that
moment
she
would
have
been
frightened
a
tolerably
long
silence
ensued
he
examined
the
flame
of
the
candle
with
a
stupid
air
and
from
around
the
wick
he
took
some
of
the
burning
wax
which
he
rolled
between
his
fingers
the
old
woman
waited
for
him
she
even
ventured
to
uplift
her
voice
once
more
what
am
i
to
say
monsieur
le
maire
say
that
it
is
well
and
that
i
am
coming
down
chapter
v
hindrances
the
posting
service
from
arras
to
m
sur
m
was
still
operated
at
this
period
by
small
mail
wagons
of
the
time
of
the
empire
these
mail
wagons
were
two
wheeled
cabriolets
upholstered
inside
with
fawn
colored
leather
hung
on
springs
and
having
but
two
seats
one
for
the
postboy
the
other
for
the
traveller
the
wheels
were
armed
with
those
long
offensive
axles
which
keep
other
vehicles
at
a
distance
and
which
may
still
be
seen
on
the
road
in
germany
the
despatch
box
an
immense
oblong
coffer
was
placed
behind
the
vehicle
and
formed
a
part
of
it
this
coffer
was
painted
black
and
the
cabriolet
yellow
these
vehicles
which
have
no
counterparts
nowadays
had
something
distorted
and
hunchbacked
about
them
and
when
one
saw
them
passing
in
the
distance
and
climbing
up
some
road
to
the
horizon
they
resembled
the
insects
which
are
called
i
think
termites
and
which
though
with
but
little
corselet
drag
a
great
train
behind
them
but
they
travelled
at
a
very
rapid
rate
the
post
wagon
which
set
out
from
arras
at
one
o
clock
every
night
after
the
mail
from
paris
had
passed
arrived
at
m
sur
m
a
little
before
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
that
night
the
wagon
which
was
descending
to
m
sur
m
by
the
hesdin
road
collided
at
the
corner
of
a
street
just
as
it
was
entering
the
town
with
a
little
tilbury
harnessed
to
a
white
horse
which
was
going
in
the
opposite
direction
and
in
which
there
was
but
one
person
a
man
enveloped
in
a
mantle
the
wheel
of
the
tilbury
received
quite
a
violent
shock
the
postman
shouted
to
the
man
to
stop
but
the
traveller
paid
no
heed
and
pursued
his
road
at
full
gallop
that
man
is
in
a
devilish
hurry
said
the
postman
the
man
thus
hastening
on
was
the
one
whom
we
have
just
seen
struggling
in
convulsions
which
are
certainly
deserving
of
pity
whither
was
he
going
he
could
not
have
told
why
was
he
hastening
he
did
not
know
he
was
driving
at
random
straight
ahead
whither
to
arras
no
doubt
but
he
might
have
been
going
elsewhere
as
well
at
times
he
was
conscious
of
it
and
he
shuddered
he
plunged
into
the
night
as
into
a
gulf
something
urged
him
forward
something
drew
him
on
no
one
could
have
told
what
was
taking
place
within
him
every
one
will
understand
it
what
man
is
there
who
has
not
entered
at
least
once
in
his
life
into
that
obscure
cavern
of
the
unknown
however
he
had
resolved
on
nothing
decided
nothing
formed
no
plan
done
nothing
none
of
the
actions
of
his
conscience
had
been
decisive
he
was
more
than
ever
as
he
had
been
at
the
first
moment
why
was
he
going
to
arras
he
repeated
what
he
had
already
said
to
himself
when
he
had
hired
scaufflaire
s
cabriolet
that
whatever
the
result
was
to
be
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
judge
of
matters
for
himself
that
this
was
even
prudent
that
he
must
know
what
took
place
that
no
decision
could
be
arrived
at
without
having
observed
and
scrutinized
that
one
made
mountains
out
of
everything
from
a
distance
that
at
any
rate
when
he
should
have
seen
that
champmathieu
some
wretch
his
conscience
would
probably
be
greatly
relieved
to
allow
him
to
go
to
the
galleys
in
his
stead
that
javert
would
indeed
be
there
and
that
brevet
that
chenildieu
that
cochepaille
old
convicts
who
had
known
him
but
they
certainly
would
not
recognize
him
bah
what
an
idea
that
javert
was
a
hundred
leagues
from
suspecting
the
truth
that
all
conjectures
and
all
suppositions
were
fixed
on
champmathieu
and
that
there
is
nothing
so
headstrong
as
suppositions
and
conjectures
that
accordingly
there
was
no
danger
that
it
was
no
doubt
a
dark
moment
but
that
he
should
emerge
from
it
that
after
all
he
held
his
destiny
however
bad
it
might
be
in
his
own
hand
that
he
was
master
of
it
he
clung
to
this
thought
at
bottom
to
tell
the
whole
truth
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
go
to
arras
nevertheless
he
was
going
thither
as
he
meditated
he
whipped
up
his
horse
which
was
proceeding
at
that
fine
regular
and
even
trot
which
accomplishes
two
leagues
and
a
half
an
hour
in
proportion
as
the
cabriolet
advanced
he
felt
something
within
him
draw
back
at
daybreak
he
was
in
the
open
country
the
town
of
m
sur
m
lay
far
behind
him
he
watched
the
horizon
grow
white
he
stared
at
all
the
chilly
figures
of
a
winter
s
dawn
as
they
passed
before
his
eyes
but
without
seeing
them
the
morning
has
its
spectres
as
well
as
the
evening
he
did
not
see
them
but
without
his
being
aware
of
it
and
by
means
of
a
sort
of
penetration
which
was
almost
physical
these
black
silhouettes
of
trees
and
of
hills
added
some
gloomy
and
sinister
quality
to
the
violent
state
of
his
soul
each
time
that
he
passed
one
of
those
isolated
dwellings
which
sometimes
border
on
the
highway
he
said
to
himself
and
yet
there
are
people
there
within
who
are
sleeping
the
trot
of
the
horse
the
bells
on
the
harness
the
wheels
on
the
road
produced
a
gentle
monotonous
noise
these
things
are
charming
when
one
is
joyous
and
lugubrious
when
one
is
sad
it
was
broad
daylight
when
he
arrived
at
hesdin
he
halted
in
front
of
the
inn
to
allow
the
horse
a
breathing
spell
and
to
have
him
given
some
oats
the
horse
belonged
as
scaufflaire
had
said
to
that
small
race
of
the
boulonnais
which
has
too
much
head
too
much
belly
and
not
enough
neck
and
shoulders
but
which
has
a
broad
chest
a
large
crupper
thin
fine
legs
and
solid
hoofs
a
homely
but
a
robust
and
healthy
race
the
excellent
beast
had
travelled
five
leagues
in
two
hours
and
had
not
a
drop
of
sweat
on
his
loins
he
did
not
get
out
of
the
tilbury
the
stableman
who
brought
the
oats
suddenly
bent
down
and
examined
the
left
wheel
are
you
going
far
in
this
condition
said
the
man
he
replied
with
an
air
of
not
having
roused
himself
from
his
revery
why
have
you
come
from
a
great
distance
went
on
the
man
five
leagues
ah
why
do
you
say
ah
the
man
bent
down
once
more
was
silent
for
a
moment
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
wheel
then
he
rose
erect
and
said
because
though
this
wheel
has
travelled
five
leagues
it
certainly
will
not
travel
another
quarter
of
a
league
he
sprang
out
of
the
tilbury
what
is
that
you
say
my
friend
i
say
that
it
is
a
miracle
that
you
should
have
travelled
five
leagues
without
you
and
your
horse
rolling
into
some
ditch
on
the
highway
just
see
here
the
wheel
really
had
suffered
serious
damage
the
shock
administered
by
the
mail
wagon
had
split
two
spokes
and
strained
the
hub
so
that
the
nut
no
longer
held
firm
my
friend
he
said
to
the
stableman
is
there
a
wheelwright
here

sir

me
the
service
to
go
and
fetch
him
he
is
only
a
step
from
here
hey
master
bourgaillard
master
bourgaillard
the
wheelwright
was
standing
on
his
own
threshold
he
came
examined
the
wheel
and
made
a
grimace
like
a
surgeon
when
the
latter
thinks
a
limb
is
broken
can
you
repair
this
wheel
immediately
yes
sir
when
can
i
set

again
to
morrow
to
morrow

a
long
day

a
hurry

a
very
great
hurry

in
an
hour
at
the
latest
impossible
sir
i
will
pay
whatever
you
ask
impossible
well
in
two
hours
then
impossible

day
two
new
spokes
and
a
hub
must
be
made
monsieur
will
not
be
able
to
start
before
to
morrow
morning
the
matter
cannot
wait
until
to
morrow
what
if
you
were
to
replace
this
wheel
instead
of
repairing
it
how
so
you
are
a
wheelwright
certainly
sir
have
you
not
a
wheel
that
you
can
sell
me
then
i
could
start
again
at
once
a
spare
wheel
yes
i
have
no
wheel
on
hand
that
would
fit
your
cabriolet
two
wheels
make
a
pair
two
wheels
cannot
be
put
together
hap
hazard
in
that
case
sell
me
a
pair
of
wheels
not
all
wheels
fit
all
axles
sir
try
nevertheless
it
is
useless
sir
i
have
nothing
to
sell
but
cart
wheels
we
are
but
a
poor
country
here
have
you
a
cabriolet
that
you
can
let
me
have
the
wheelwright
had
seen
at
the
first
glance
that
the
tilbury
was
a
hired
vehicle
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
treat
the
cabriolets
that
people
let
you
so
well
if
i
had
one
i
would
not
let
it
to
you
well
sell
it
to
me
then
i
have
none
what
not
even
a
spring
cart
i
am
not
hard
to
please
as
you
see
we
live
in
a
poor
country
there
is
in
truth
added
the
wheelwright
an
old
calash
under
the
shed
yonder
which
belongs
to
a
bourgeois
of
the
town
who
gave
it
to
me
to
take
care
of
and
who
only
uses
it
on
the
thirty
sixth
of
the
month
never
that
is
to
say
i
might
let
that
to
you
for
what
matters
it
to
me
but
the
bourgeois
must
not
see
it
pass
and
then
it
is
a
calash
it
would
require
two
horses
i
will
take
two
post
horses
where
is
monsieur
going
to
arras
and
monsieur
wishes
to
reach
there
to
day
yes
of
course
by
taking
two
post
horses
why
not
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
monsieur
arrives
at
four
o
clock
to
morrow
morning
certainly
not
there
is
one
thing
to
be
said
about
that
you
see
by
taking
post
horses
monsieur
has
his
passport
yes
well
by
taking
post
horses
monsieur
cannot
reach
arras
before
to
morrow
we
are
on
a
cross
road
the
relays
are
badly
served
the
horses
are
in
the
fields
the
season
for
ploughing
is
just
beginning
heavy
teams
are
required
and
horses
are
seized
upon
everywhere
from
the
post
as
well
as
elsewhere
monsieur
will
have
to
wait
three
or
four
hours
at
the
least
at
every
relay
and
then
they
drive
at
a
walk
there
are
many
hills
to
ascend
come
then
i
will
go
on
horseback
unharness
the
cabriolet
some
one
can
surely
sell
me
a
saddle
in
the
neighborhood
without
doubt
but
will
this
horse
bear
the
saddle
that
is
true
you
remind
me
of
that
he
will
not
bear
it
then
but
i
can
surely
hire
a
horse
in
the
village
a
horse
to
travel
to
arras
at
one
stretch
yes
that
would
require
such
a
horse
as
does
not
exist
in
these
parts
you
would
have
to
buy
it
to
begin
with
because
no
one
knows
you
but
you
will
not
find
one
for
sale
nor
to
let
for
five
hundred
francs
or
for
a
thousand
what
am
i
to
do
the
best
thing
is
to
let
me
repair
the
wheel
like
an
honest
man
and
set
out
on
your
journey
to
morrow
to
morrow
will
be
too
late
the
deuce
is
there
not
a
mail
wagon
which
runs
to
arras
when
will
it
pass
to
night
both
the
posts
pass
at
night
the
one
going
as
well
as
the
one
coming
what
it
will
take
you
a
day
to
mend
this
wheel
a
day
and
a
good
long
one
if
you
set
two
men
to
work
if
i
set
ten
men
to
work
what
if
the
spokes
were
to
be
tied
together
with
ropes
that
could
be
done
with
the
spokes
not
with
the
hub
and
the
felly
is
in
a
bad
state
too
is
there
any
one
in
this
village
who
lets
out
teams
no
is
there
another
wheelwright
the
stableman
and
the
wheelwright
replied
in
concert
with
a
toss
of
the
head
no
he
felt
an
immense
joy
it
was
evident
that
providence
was
intervening
that
it
was
it
who
had
broken
the
wheel
of
the
tilbury
and
who
was
stopping
him
on
the
road
he
had
not
yielded
to
this
sort
of
first
summons
he
had
just
made
every
possible
effort
to
continue
the
journey
he
had
loyally
and
scrupulously
exhausted
all
means
he
had
been
deterred
neither
by
the
season
nor
fatigue
nor
by
the
expense
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
himself
if
he
went
no
further
that
was
no
fault
of
his
it
did
not
concern
him
further
it
was
no
longer
his
fault
it
was
not
the
act
of
his
own
conscience
but
the
act
of
providence
he
breathed
again
he
breathed
freely
and
to
the
full
extent
of
his
lungs
for
the
first
time
since
javert
s
visit
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
hand
of
iron
which
had
held
his
heart
in
its
grasp
for
the
last
twenty
hours
had
just
released
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
god
was
for
him
now
and
was
manifesting
himself
he
said
himself
that
he
had
done
all
he
could
and
that
now
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
retrace
his
steps
quietly
if
his
conversation
with
the
wheelwright
had
taken
place
in
a
chamber
of
the
inn
it
would
have
had
no
witnesses
no
one
would
have
heard
him
things
would
have
rested
there
and
it
is
probable
that
we
should
not
have
had
to
relate
any
of
the
occurrences
which
the
reader
is
about
to
peruse
but
this
conversation
had
taken
place
in
the
street
any
colloquy
in
the
street
inevitably
attracts
a
crowd
there
are
always
people
who
ask
nothing
better
than
to
become
spectators
while
he
was
questioning
the
wheelwright
some
people
who
were
passing
back
and
forth
halted
around
them
after
listening
for
a
few
minutes
a
young
lad
to
whom
no
one
had
paid
any
heed
detached
himself
from
the
group
and
ran
off
at
the
moment
when
the
traveller
after
the
inward
deliberation
which
we
have
just
described
resolved
to
retrace
his
steps
this
child
returned
he
was
accompanied
by
an
old
woman
monsieur
said
the
woman
my
boy
tells
me
that
you
wish
to
hire
a
cabriolet
these
simple
words
uttered
by
an
old
woman
led
by
a
child
made
the
perspiration
trickle
down
his
limbs
he
thought
that
he
beheld
the
hand
which
had
relaxed
its
grasp
reappear
in
the
darkness
behind
him
ready
to
seize
him
once
more
he
answered
yes
my
good
woman
i
am
in
search
of
a
cabriolet
which
i
can
hire
and
he
hastened
to
add
but
there
is
none
in
the
place
certainly
there
is
said
the
old
woman
where
interpolated
the
wheelwright
at
my
house
replied
the
old
woman
he
shuddered
the
fatal
hand
had
grasped
him
again
the
old
woman
really
had
in
her
shed
a
sort
of
basket
spring
cart
the
wheelwright
and
the
stable
man
in
despair
at
the
prospect
of
the
traveller
escaping
their
clutches
interfered
it
was
a
frightful
old
trap
it
rests
flat
on
the
axle
it
is
an
actual
fact
that
the
seats
were
suspended
inside
it
by
leather
thongs
the
rain
came
into
it
the
wheels
were
rusted
and
eaten
with
moisture
it
would
not
go
much
further
than
the
tilbury
a
regular
ramshackle
old
stage
wagon
the
gentleman
would
make
a
great
mistake
if
he
trusted
himself
to
it
etc
etc
all
this
was
true
but
this
trap
this
ramshackle
old
vehicle
this
thing
whatever
it
was
ran
on
its
two
wheels
and
could
go
to
arras
he
paid
what
was
asked
left
the
tilbury
with
the
wheelwright
to
be
repaired
intending
to
reclaim
it
on
his
return
had
the
white
horse
put
to
the
cart
climbed
into
it
and
resumed
the
road
which
he
had
been
travelling
since
morning
at
the
moment
when
the
cart
moved
off
he
admitted
that
he
had
felt
a
moment
previously
a
certain
joy
in
the
thought
that
he
should
not
go
whither
he
was
now
proceeding
he
examined
this
joy
with
a
sort
of
wrath
and
found
it
absurd
why
should
he
feel
joy
at
turning
back
after
all
he
was
taking
this
trip
of
his
own
free
will
no
one
was
forcing
him
to
it
and
assuredly
nothing
would
happen
except
what
he
should
choose
as
he
left
hesdin
he
heard
a
voice
shouting
to
him
stop
stop
he
halted
the
cart
with
a
vigorous
movement
which
contained
a
feverish
and
convulsive
element
resembling
hope
it
was
the
old
woman
s
little
boy
monsieur
said
the
latter
it
was
i
who
got
the
cart
for
you
well
you
have
not
given
me
anything
he
who
gave
to
all
so
readily
thought
this
demand
exorbitant
and
almost
odious
ah
it
s
you
you
scamp
said
he
you
shall
have
nothing
he
whipped
up
his
horse
and
set
off
at
full
speed
he
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
at
hesdin
he
wanted
to
make
it
good
the
little
horse
was
courageous
and
pulled
for
two
but
it
was
the
month
of
february
there
had
been
rain
the
roads
were
bad
and
then
it
was
no
longer
the
tilbury
the
cart
was
very
heavy
and
in
addition
there
were
many
ascents
he
took
nearly
four
hours
to
go
from
hesdin
to
saint
pol
four
hours
for
five
leagues
at
saint
pol
he
had
the
horse
unharnessed
at
the
first
inn
he
came
to
and
led
to
the
stable
as
he
had
promised
scaufflaire
he
stood
beside
the
manger
while
the
horse
was
eating
he
thought
of
sad
and
confusing
things
the
inn
keeper
s
wife
came
to
the
stable
does
not
monsieur
wish
to
breakfast
come
that
is
true
i
even
have
a
good
appetite
he
followed
the
woman
who
had
a
rosy
cheerful
face
she
led
him
to
the
public
room
where
there
were
tables
covered
with
waxed
cloth
make
haste
said
he
i
must
start
again
i
am
in
a
hurry
a
big
flemish
servant
maid
placed
his
knife
and
fork
in
all
haste
he
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
sensation
of
comfort
that
is
what
ailed
me
he
thought
i
had
not
breakfasted
his
breakfast
was
served
he
seized
the
bread
took
a
mouthful
and
then
slowly
replaced
it
on
the
table
and
did
not
touch
it
again
a
carter
was
eating
at
another
table
he
said
to
this
man
why
is
their
bread
so
bitter
here
the
carter
was
a
german
and
did
not
understand
him
he
returned
to
the
stable
and
remained
near
the
horse
an
hour
later
he
had
quitted
saint
pol
and
was
directing
his
course
towards
tinques
which
is
only
five
leagues
from
arras
what
did
he
do
during
this
journey
of
what
was
he
thinking
as
in
the
morning
he
watched
the
trees
the
thatched
roofs
the
tilled
fields
pass
by
and
the
way
in
which
the
landscape
broken
at
every
turn
of
the
road
vanished
this
is
a
sort
of
contemplation
which
sometimes
suffices
to
the
soul
and
almost
relieves
it
from
thought
what
is
more
melancholy
and
more
profound
than
to
see
a
thousand
objects
for
the
first
and
the
last
time
to
travel
is
to
be
born
and
to
die
at
every
instant
perhaps
in
the
vaguest
region
of
his
mind
he
did
make
comparisons
between
the
shifting
horizon
and
our
human
existence
all
the
things
of
life
are
perpetually
fleeing
before
us
the
dark
and
bright
intervals
are
intermingled
after
a
dazzling
moment
an
eclipse
we
look
we
hasten
we
stretch
out
our
hands
to
grasp
what
is
passing
each
event
is
a
turn
in
the
road
and
all
at
once
we
are
old
we
feel
a
shock
all
is
black
we
distinguish
an
obscure
door
the
gloomy
horse
of
life
which
has
been
drawing
us
halts
and
we
see
a
veiled
and
unknown
person
unharnessing
amid
the
shadows
twilight
was
falling
when
the
children
who
were
coming
out
of
school
beheld
this
traveller
enter
tinques
it
is
true
that
the
days
were
still
short
he
did
not
halt
at
tinques
as
he
emerged
from
the
village
a
laborer
who
was
mending
the
road
with
stones
raised
his
head
and
said
to
him
that
horse
is
very
much
fatigued
the
poor
beast
was
in
fact
going
at
a
walk
are
you
going
to
arras
added
the
road
mender
yes
if
you
go
on
at
that
rate
you
will
not
arrive
very
early
he
stopped
his
horse
and
asked
the
laborer
how
far
is
it
from
here
to
arras
nearly
seven
good
leagues
how
is
that
the
posting
guide
only
says
five
leagues
and
a
quarter
ah
returned
the
road
mender
so
you
don
t
know
that
the
road
is
under
repair
you
will
find
it
barred
a
quarter
of
an
hour
further
on
there
is
no
way
to
proceed
further
really
you
will
take
the
road
on
the
left
leading
to
carency
you
will
cross
the
river
when
you
reach
camblin
you
will
turn
to
the
right
that
is
the
road
to
mont
saint
eloy
which
leads
to
arras
but
it
is
night
and
i
shall
lose
my
way
you
do
not
belong
in
these
parts
no
and
besides
it
is
all
cross
roads
stop
sir
resumed
the
road
mender
shall
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
your
horse
is
tired
return
to
tinques
there
is
a
good
inn
there
sleep
there
you
can
reach
arras
to
morrow
i
must
be
there
this
evening
that
is
different
but
go
to
the
inn
all
the
same
and
get
an
extra
horse
the
stable
boy
will
guide
you
through
the
cross
roads
he
followed
the
road
mender
s
advice
retraced
his
steps
and
half
an
hour
later
he
passed
the
same
spot
again
but
this
time
at
full
speed
with
a
good
horse
to
aid
a
stable
boy
who
called
himself
a
postilion
was
seated
on
the
shaft
of
the
cariole
still
he
felt
that
he
had
lost
time
night
had
fully
come
they
turned
into
the
cross
road
the
way
became
frightfully
bad
the
cart
lurched
from
one
rut
to
the
other
he
said
to
the
postilion
keep
at
a
trot
and
you
shall
have
a
double
fee
in
one
of
the
jolts
the
whiffle
tree
broke
there
s
the
whiffle
tree
broken
sir
said
the
postilion
i
don
t
know
how
to
harness
my
horse
now
this
road
is
very
bad
at
night
if
you
wish
to
return
and
sleep
at
tinques
we
could
be
in
arras
early
to
morrow
morning
he
replied
have
you
a
bit
of
rope
and
a
knife
yes
sir
he
cut
a
branch
from
a
tree
and
made
a
whiffle
tree
of
it
this
caused
another
loss
of
twenty
minutes
but
they
set
out
again
at
a
gallop
the
plain
was
gloomy
low
hanging
black
crisp
fogs
crept
over
the
hills
and
wrenched
themselves
away
like
smoke
there
were
whitish
gleams
in
the
clouds
a
strong
breeze
which
blew
in
from
the
sea
produced
a
sound
in
all
quarters
of
the
horizon
as
of
some
one
moving
furniture
everything
that
could
be
seen
assumed
attitudes
of
terror
how
many
things
shiver
beneath
these
vast
breaths
of
the
night
he
was
stiff
with
cold
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
night
before
he
vaguely
recalled
his
other
nocturnal
trip
in
the
vast
plain
in
the
neighborhood
of
d
eight
years
previously
and
it
seemed
but
yesterday
the
hour
struck
from
a
distant
tower
he
asked
the
boy
what
time
is
it
seven
o
clock
sir
we
shall
reach
arras
at
eight
we
have
but
three
leagues
still
to
go
at
that
moment
he
for
the
first
time
indulged
in
this
reflection
thinking
it
odd
the
while
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
sooner
that
all
this
trouble
which
he
was
taking
was
perhaps
useless
that
he
did
not
know
so
much
as
the
hour
of
the
trial
that
he
should
at
least
have
informed
himself
of
that
that
he
was
foolish
to
go
thus
straight
ahead
without
knowing
whether
he
would
be
of
any
service
or
not
then
he
sketched
out
some
calculations
in
his
mind
that
ordinarily
the
sittings
of
the
court
of
assizes
began
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
that
it
could
not
be
a
long
affair
that
the
theft
of
the
apples
would
be
very
brief
that
there
would
then
remain
only
a
question
of
identity
four
or
five
depositions
and
very
little
for
the
lawyers
to
say
that
he
should
arrive
after
all
was
over
the
postilion
whipped
up
the
horses
they
had
crossed
the
river
and
left
mont
saint
eloy
behind
them
the
night
grew
more
profound
chapter
vi
sister
simplice
put
to
the
proof
but
at
that
moment
fantine
was
joyous
she
had
passed
a
very
bad
night
her
cough
was
frightful
her
fever
had
doubled
in
intensity
she
had
had
dreams
in
the
morning
when
the
doctor
paid
his
visit
she
was
delirious
he
assumed
an
alarmed
look
and
ordered
that
he
should
be
informed
as
soon
as
m
madeleine
arrived
all
the
morning
she
was
melancholy
said
but
little
and
laid
plaits
in
her
sheets
murmuring
the
while
in
a
low
voice
calculations
which
seemed
to
be
calculations
of
distances
her
eyes
were
hollow
and
staring
they
seemed
almost
extinguished
at
intervals
then
lighted
up
again
and
shone
like
stars
it
seems
as
though
at
the
approach
of
a
certain
dark
hour
the
light
of
heaven
fills
those
who
are
quitting
the
light
of
earth
each
time
that
sister
simplice
asked
her
how
she
felt
she
replied
invariably
well
i
should
like
to
see
m
madeleine
some
months
before
this
at
the
moment
when
fantine
had
just
lost
her
last
modesty
her
last
shame
and
her
last
joy
she
was
the
shadow
of
herself
now
she
was
the
spectre
of
herself
physical
suffering
had
completed
the
work
of
moral
suffering
this
creature
of
five
and
twenty
had
a
wrinkled
brow
flabby
cheeks
pinched
nostrils
teeth
from
which
the
gums
had
receded
a
leaden
complexion
a
bony
neck
prominent
shoulder
blades
frail
limbs
a
clayey
skin
and
her
golden
hair
was
growing
out
sprinkled
with
gray
alas
how
illness
improvises
old
age
at
mid
day
the
physician
returned
gave
some
directions
inquired
whether
the
mayor
had
made
his
appearance
at
the
infirmary
and
shook
his
head
m
madeleine
usually
came
to
see
the
invalid
at
three
o
clock
as
exactness
is
kindness
he
was
exact
about
half
past
two
fantine
began
to
be
restless
in
the
course
of
twenty
minutes
she
asked
the
nun
more
than
ten
times
what
time
is
it
sister
three
o
clock
struck
at
the
third
stroke
fantine
sat
up
in
bed
she
who
could
in
general
hardly
turn
over
joined
her
yellow
fleshless
hands
in
a
sort
of
convulsive
clasp
and
the
nun
heard
her
utter
one
of
those
profound
sighs
which
seem
to
throw
off
dejection
then
fantine
turned
and
looked
at
the
door
no
one
entered
the
door
did
not
open
she
remained
thus
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
door
motionless
and
apparently
holding
her
breath
the
sister
dared
not
speak
to
her
the
clock
struck
a
quarter
past
three
fantine
fell
back
on
her
pillow
she
said
nothing
but
began
to
plait
the
sheets
once
more
half
an
hour
passed
then
an
hour
no
one
came
every
time
the
clock
struck
fantine
started
up
and
looked
towards
the
door
then
fell
back
again
her
thought
was
clearly
perceptible
but
she
uttered
no
name
she
made
no
complaint
she
blamed
no
one
but
she
coughed
in
a
melancholy
way
one
would
have
said
that
something
dark
was
descending
upon
her
she
was
livid
and
her
lips
were
blue
she
smiled
now
and
then
five
o
clock
struck
then
the
sister
heard
her
say
very
low
and
gently
he
is
wrong
not
to
come
to
day
since
i
am
going
away
to
morrow
sister
simplice
herself
was
surprised
at
m
madeleine
s
delay
in
the
meantime
fantine
was
staring
at
the
tester
of
her
bed
she
seemed
to
be
endeavoring
to
recall
something
all
at
once
she
began
to
sing
in
a
voice
as
feeble
as
a
breath
the
nun
listened
this
is
what
fantine
was
singing
lovely
things

will
buy
as
we
stroll
the
faubourgs
through
roses

pink

this
song
was
an
old
cradle
romance
with
which
she
had
in
former
days
lulled
her
little
cosette
to
sleep
and
which
had
never
recurred
to
her
mind
in
all
the
five
years
during
which
she
had
been
parted
from
her
child
she
sang
it
in
so
sad
a
voice
and
to
so
sweet
an
air
that
it
was
enough
to
make
any
one
even
a
nun
weep
the
sister
accustomed
as
she
was
to
austerities
felt
a
tear
spring
to
her
eyes
the
clock
struck
six
fantine
did
not
seem
to
hear
it
she
no
longer
seemed
to
pay
attention
to
anything
about
her
sister
simplice
sent
a
serving
maid
to
inquire
of
the
portress
of
the
factory
whether
the
mayor
had
returned
and
if
he
would
not
come
to
the
infirmary
soon
the
girl
returned
in
a
few
minutes
fantine
was
still
motionless
and
seemed
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
the
servant
informed
sister
simplice
in
a
very
low
tone
that
the
mayor
had
set
out
that
morning
before
six
o
clock
in
a
little
tilbury
harnessed
to
a
white
horse
cold
as
the
weather
was
that
he
had
gone
alone
without
even
a
driver
that
no
one
knew
what
road
he
had
taken
that
people
said
he
had
been
seen
to
turn
into
the
road
to
arras
that
others
asserted
that
they
had
met
him
on
the
road
to
paris
that
when
he
went
away
he
had
been
very
gentle
as
usual
and
that
he
had
merely
told
the
portress
not
to
expect
him
that
night
while
the
two
women
were
whispering
together
with
their
backs
turned
to
fantine
s
bed
the
sister
interrogating
the
servant
conjecturing
fantine
with
the
feverish
vivacity
of
certain
organic
maladies
which
unite
the
free
movements
of
health
with
the
frightful
emaciation
of
death
had
raised
herself
to
her
knees
in
bed
with
her
shrivelled
hands
resting
on
the
bolster
and
her
head
thrust
through
the
opening
of
the
curtains
and
was
listening
all
at
once
she
cried
you
are
speaking
of
m
madeleine
why
are
you
talking
so
low
what
is
he
doing
why
does
he
not
come
her
voice
was
so
abrupt
and
hoarse
that
the
two
women
thought
they
heard
the
voice
of
a
man
they
wheeled
round
in
affright
answer
me
cried
fantine
the
servant
stammered
the
portress
told
me
that
he
could
not
come
to
day
be
calm
my
child
said
the
sister
lie
down
again
fantine
without
changing
her
attitude
continued
in
a
loud
voice
and
with
an
accent
that
was
both
imperious
and
heart
rending
he
cannot
come
why
not
you
know
the
reason
you
are
whispering
it
to
each
other
there
i
want
to
know
it
the
servant
maid
hastened
to
say
in
the
nun
s
ear
say
that
he
is
busy
with
the
city
council
sister
simplice
blushed
faintly
for
it
was
a
lie
that
the
maid
had
proposed
to
her
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
mere
communication
of
the
truth
to
the
invalid
would
without
doubt
deal
her
a
terrible
blow
and
that
this
was
a
serious
matter
in
fantine
s
present
state
her
flush
did
not
last
long
the
sister
raised
her
calm
sad
eyes
to
fantine
and
said
monsieur
le
maire
has
gone
away
fantine
raised
herself
and
crouched
on
her
heels
in
the
bed
her
eyes
sparkled
indescribable
joy
beamed
from
that
melancholy
face
gone
she
cried
he
has
gone
to
get
cosette
then
she
raised
her
arms
to
heaven
and
her
white
face
became
ineffable
her
lips
moved
she
was
praying
in
a
low
voice
when
her
prayer
was
finished
sister
she
said
i
am
willing
to
lie
down
again
i
will
do
anything
you
wish
i
was
naughty
just
now
i
beg
your
pardon
for
having
spoken
so
loud
it
is
very
wrong
to
talk
loudly
i
know
that
well
my
good
sister
but
you
see
i
am
very
happy
the
good
god
is
good
m
madeleine
is
good
just
think
he
has
gone
to
montfermeil
to
get
my
little
cosette
she
lay
down
again
with
the
nun
s
assistance
helped
the
nun
to
arrange
her
pillow
and
kissed
the
little
silver
cross
which
she
wore
on
her
neck
and
which
sister
simplice
had
given
her
my
child
said
the
sister
try
to
rest
now
and
do
not
talk
any
more
fantine
took
the
sister
s
hand
in
her
moist
hands
and
the
latter
was
pained
to
feel
that
perspiration
he
set
out
this
morning
for
paris
in
fact
he
need
not
even
go
through
paris
montfermeil
is
a
little
to
the
left
as
you
come
thence
do
you
remember
how
he
said
to
me
yesterday
when
i
spoke
to
him
of
cosette
soon
soon
he
wants
to
give
me
a
surprise
you
know
he
made
me
sign
a
letter
so
that
she
could
be
taken
from
the
thenardiers
they
cannot
say
anything
can
they
they
will
give
back
cosette
for
they
have
been
paid
the
authorities
will
not
allow
them
to
keep
the
child
since
they
have
received
their
pay
do
not
make
signs
to
me
that
i
must
not
talk
sister
i
am
extremely
happy
i
am
doing
well
i
am
not
ill
at
all
any
more
i
am
going
to
see
cosette
again
i
am
even
quite
hungry
it
is
nearly
five
years
since
i
saw
her
last
you
cannot
imagine
how
much
attached
one
gets
to
children
and
then
she
will
be
so
pretty
you
will
see
if
you
only
knew
what
pretty
little
rosy
fingers
she
had
in
the
first
place
she
will
have
very
beautiful
hands
she
had
ridiculous
hands
when
she
was
only
a
year
old
like
this
she
must
be
a
big
girl
now
she
is
seven
years
old
she
is
quite
a
young
lady
i
call
her
cosette
but
her
name
is
really
euphrasie
stop
this
morning
i
was
looking
at
the
dust
on
the
chimney
piece
and
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
come
across
me
like
that
that
i
should
see
cosette
again
soon
mon
dieu
how
wrong
it
is
not
to
see
one
s
children
for
years
one
ought
to
reflect
that
life
is
not
eternal
oh
how
good
m
le
maire
is
to
go
it
is
very
cold
it
is
true
he
had
on
his
cloak
at
least
he
will
be
here
to
morrow
will
he
not
to
morrow
will
be
a
festival
day
to
morrow
morning
sister
you
must
remind
me
to
put
on
my
little
cap
that
has
lace
on
it
what
a
place
that
montfermeil
is
i
took
that
journey
on
foot
once
it
was
very
long
for
me
but
the
diligences
go
very
quickly
he
will
be
here
to
morrow
with
cosette
how
far
is
it
from
here
to
montfermeil
the
sister
who
had
no
idea
of
distances
replied
oh
i
think
that
he
will
be
here
to
morrow
to
morrow
to
morrow
said
fantine
i
shall
see
cosette
to
morrow
you
see
good
sister
of
the
good
god
that
i
am
no
longer
ill
i
am
mad
i
could
dance
if
any
one
wished
it
a
person
who
had
seen
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
previously
would
not
have
understood
the
change
she
was
all
rosy
now
she
spoke
in
a
lively
and
natural
voice
her
whole
face
was
one
smile
now
and
then
she
talked
she
laughed
softly
the
joy
of
a
mother
is
almost
infantile
well
resumed
the
nun
now
that
you
are
happy
mind
me
and
do
not
talk
any
more
fantine
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
and
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
lie
down
again
be
good
for
you
are
going
to
have
your
child
sister
simplice
is
right
every
one
here
is
right
and
then
without
stirring
without
even
moving
her
head
she
began
to
stare
all
about
her
with
wide
open
eyes
and
a
joyous
air
and
she
said
nothing
more
the
sister
drew
the
curtains
together
again
hoping
that
she
would
fall
into
a
doze
between
seven
and
eight
o
clock
the
doctor
came
not
hearing
any
sound
he
thought
fantine
was
asleep
entered
softly
and
approached
the
bed
on
tiptoe
he
opened
the
curtains
a
little
and
by
the
light
of
the
taper
he
saw
fantine
s
big
eyes
gazing
at
him
she
said
to
him
she
will
be
allowed
to
sleep
beside
me
in
a
little
bed
will
she
not
sir
the
doctor
thought
that
she
was
delirious
she
added
see
there
is
just
room
the
doctor
took
sister
simplice
aside
and
she
explained
matters
to
him
that
m
madeleine
was
absent
for
a
day
or
two
and
that
in
their
doubt
they
had
not
thought
it
well
to
undeceive
the
invalid
who
believed
that
the
mayor
had
gone
to
montfermeil
that
it
was
possible
after
all
that
her
guess
was
correct
the
doctor
approved
he
returned
to
fantine
s
bed
and
she
went
on
you
see
when
she
wakes
up
in
the
morning
i
shall
be
able
to
say
good
morning
to
her
poor
kitten
and
when
i
cannot
sleep
at
night
i
can
hear
her
asleep
her
little
gentle
breathing
will
do
me
good
give
me
your
hand
said
the
doctor
she
stretched
out
her
arm
and
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
ah
hold
in
truth
you
did
not
know

the

was
surprised
she
was
better
the
pressure
on
her
chest
had
decreased
her

had
regained
its

a
sort
of

suddenly
supervened

she
went
on
did
the

tell
you
that

has
gone
to
get
that
mite
of
a

the
doctor
recommended
silence
and
that
all
painful
emotions
should
be
avoided
he
prescribed
an
infusion
of
pure
chinchona
and
in
case
the
fever
should
increase
again
during
the
night
a
calming
potion
as
he
took
his
departure
he
said
to
the

she
is
doing
better
if
good
luck
willed
that
the

should
actually
arrive

with
the

the
traveller
on
his
arrival
takes
precautions
for
departure
it
was
nearly
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
when
the
cart
which
we
left
on
the
road
entered
the
porte
cochere
of
the
hotel
de
la
poste
in
arras
the
man
whom
we
have
been
following
up
to
this
moment
alighted
from
it
responded
with
an
abstracted
air
to
the
attentions
of
the
people
of
the
inn
sent
back
the
extra
horse
and
with
his
own
hands
led
the
little
white
horse
to
the
stable
then
he
opened
the
door
of
a
billiard
room
which
was
situated
on
the
ground
floor
sat
down
there
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
a
table
he
had
taken
fourteen
hours
for
the
journey
which
he
had
counted
on
making
in
six
he
did
himself
the
justice
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
not
his
fault
but
at
bottom
he
was
not
sorry
the
landlady
of
the
hotel
entered
does
monsieur
wish
a
bed
does
monsieur
require
supper
he
made
a
sign
of
the
head
in
the
negative
the
stableman
says
that
monsieur
s
horse
is
extremely
fatigued
here
he
broke
his
silence
will
not
the
horse
be
in
a
condition
to
set
out
again
to
morrow
morning
oh
monsieur
he
must
rest
for
two
days
at
least
he
inquired
is
not
the
posting
station
located
here
yes
sir
the
hostess
conducted
him
to
the
office
he
showed
his
passport
and
inquired
whether
there
was
any
way
of
returning
that
same
night
to
m
sur
m
by
the
mail
wagon
the
seat
beside
the
post
boy
chanced
to
be
vacant
he
engaged
it
and
paid
for
it
monsieur
said
the
clerk
do
not
fail
to
be
here
ready
to
start
at
precisely
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
this
done
he
left
the
hotel
and
began
to
wander
about
the
town
he
was
not
acquainted
with
arras
the
streets
were
dark
and
he
walked
on
at
random
but
he
seemed
bent
upon
not
asking
the
way
of
the
passers
by
he
crossed
the
little
river
crinchon
and
found
himself
in
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
alleys
where
he
lost
his
way
a
citizen
was
passing
along
with
a
lantern
after
some
hesitation
he
decided
to
apply
to
this
man
not
without
having
first
glanced
behind
and
in
front
of
him
as
though
he
feared
lest
some
one
should
hear
the
question
which
he
was
about
to
put
monsieur
said
he
where
is
the
court
house
if
you
please
you
do
not
belong
in
town
sir
replied
the
bourgeois
who
was
an
oldish
man
well
follow
me
i
happen
to
be
going
in
the
direction
of
the
court
house
that
is
to
say
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
of
the
prefecture
for
the
court
house
is
undergoing
repairs
just
at
this
moment
and
the
courts
are
holding
their
sittings
provisionally
in
the
prefecture
is
it
there
that
the
assizes
are
held
he
asked
certainly
sir
you
see
the
prefecture
of
to
day
was
the
bishop
s
palace
before
the
revolution
m
de
conzie
who
was
bishop
in
82
built
a
grand
hall
there
it
is
in
this
grand
hall
that
the
court
is
held
on
the
way
the
bourgeois
said
to
him
if
monsieur
desires
to
witness
a
case
it
is
rather
late
the
sittings
generally
close
at
six
o
clock
when
they
arrived
on
the
grand
square
however
the
man
pointed
out
to
him
four
long
windows
all
lighted
up
in
the
front
of
a
vast
and
gloomy
building
upon
my
word
sir
you
are
in
luck
you
have
arrived
in
season
do
you
see
those
four
windows
that
is
the
court
of
assizes
there
is
light
there
so
they
are
not
through
the
matter
must
have
been
greatly
protracted
and
they
are
holding
an
evening
session
do
you
take
an
interest
in
this
affair
is
it
a
criminal
case
are
you
a
witness
he
replied
i
have
not
come
on
any
business
i
only
wish
to
speak
to
one
of
the
lawyers
that
is
different
said
the
bourgeois
stop
sir
here
is
the
door
where
the
sentry
stands
you
have
only
to
ascend
the
grand
staircase
he
conformed
to
the
bourgeois
s
directions
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
in
a
hall
containing
many
people
and
where
groups
intermingled
with
lawyers
in
their
gowns
were
whispering
together
here
and
there
it
is
always
a
heart
breaking
thing
to
see
these
congregations
of
men
robed
in
black
murmuring
together
in
low
voices
on
the
threshold
of
the
halls
of
justice
it
is
rare
that
charity
and
pity
are
the
outcome
of
these
words
condemnations
pronounced
in
advance
are
more
likely
to
be
the
result
all
these
groups
seem
to
the
passing
and
thoughtful
observer
so
many
sombre
hives
where
buzzing
spirits
construct
in
concert
all
sorts
of
dark
edifices
this
spacious
hall
illuminated
by
a
single
lamp
was
the
old
hall
of
the
episcopal
palace
and
served
as
the
large
hall
of
the
palace
of
justice
a
double
leaved
door
which
was
closed
at
that
moment
separated
it
from
the
large
apartment
where
the
court
was
sitting
the
obscurity
was
such
that
he
did
not
fear
to
accost
the
first
lawyer
whom
he
met
what
stage
have
they
reached
sir
he
asked
it
is
finished
said
the
lawyer
finished
this
word
was
repeated
in
such
accents
that
the
lawyer
turned
round
excuse
me
sir
perhaps
you
are
a
relative
no
i
know
no
one
here
has
judgment
been
pronounced
of
course
nothing
else
was
possible
to
penal
servitude
for
life
he
continued
in
a
voice
so
weak
that
it
was
barely
audible
then
his
identity
was
established
what
identity
replied
the
lawyer
there
was
no
identity
to
be
established
the
matter
was
very
simple
the
woman
had
murdered
her
child
the
infanticide
was
proved
the
jury
threw
out
the
question
of
premeditation
and
she
was
condemned
for
life
so
it
was
a
woman
said
he
why
certainly
the
limosin
woman
of
what
are
you
speaking
nothing
but
since
it
is
all
over
how
comes
it
that
the
hall
is
still
lighted
for
another
case
which
was
begun
about
two
hours
ago
what
other
case
oh
this
one
is
a
clear
case
also
it
is
about
a
sort
of
blackguard
a
man
arrested
for
a
second
offence
a
convict
who
has
been
guilty
of
theft
i
don
t
know
his
name
exactly
there
s
a
bandit
s
phiz
for
you
i
d
send
him
to
the
galleys
on
the
strength
of
his
face
alone
is
there
any
way
of
getting
into
the
court
room
sir
said
he
i
really
think
that
there
is
not
there
is
a
great
crowd
however
the
hearing
has
been
suspended
some
people
have
gone
out
and
when
the
hearing
is
resumed
you
might
make
an
effort
where
is
the
entrance
through
yonder
large
door
the
lawyer
left
him
in
the
course
of
a
few
moments
he
had
experienced
almost
simultaneously
almost
intermingled
with
each
other
all
possible
emotions
the
words
of
this
indifferent
spectator
had
in
turn
pierced
his
heart
like
needles
of
ice
and
like
blades
of
fire
when
he
saw
that
nothing
was
settled
he
breathed
freely
once
more
but
he
could
not
have
told
whether
what
he
felt
was
pain
or
pleasure
he
drew
near
to
many
groups
and
listened
to
what
they
were
saying
the
docket
of
the
session
was
very
heavy
the
president
had
appointed
for
the
same
day
two
short
and
simple
cases
they
had
begun
with
the
infanticide
and
now
they
had
reached
the
convict
the
old
offender
the
return
horse
this
man
had
stolen
apples
but
that
did
not
appear
to
be
entirely
proved
what
had
been
proved
was
that
he
had
already
been
in
the
galleys
at
toulon
it
was
that
which
lent
a
bad
aspect
to
his
case
however
the
man
s
examination
and
the
depositions
of
the
witnesses
had
been
completed
but
the
lawyer
s
plea
and
the
speech
of
the
public
prosecutor
were
still
to
come
it
could
not
be
finished
before
midnight
the
man
would
probably
be
condemned
the
attorney
general
was
very
clever
and
never
missed
his
culprits
he
was
a
brilliant
fellow
who
wrote
verses
an
usher
stood
at
the
door
communicating
with
the
hall
of
the
assizes
he
inquired
of
this
usher
will
the
door
be
opened
soon
sir
it
will
not
be
opened
at
all
replied
the
usher
what
it
will
not
be
opened
when
the
hearing
is
resumed
is
not
the
hearing
suspended
the
hearing
has
just
been
begun
again
replied
the
usher
but
the
door
will
not
be
opened
again
why
because
the
hall
is
full
what
there
is
not
room
for
one
more
not
another
one
the
door
is
closed
no
one
can
enter
now
the
usher
added
after
a
pause
there
are
to
tell
the
truth
two
or
three
extra
places
behind
monsieur
le
president
but
monsieur
le
president
only
admits
public
functionaries
to
them
so
saying
the
usher
turned
his
back
he
retired
with
bowed
head
traversed
the
antechamber
and
slowly
descended
the
stairs
as
though
hesitating
at
every
step
it
is
probable
that
he
was
holding
counsel
with
himself
the
violent
conflict
which
had
been
going
on
within
him
since
the
preceding
evening
was
not
yet
ended
and
every
moment
he
encountered
some
new
phase
of
it
on
reaching
the
landing
place
he
leaned
his
back
against
the
balusters
and
folded
his
arms
all
at
once
he
opened
his
coat
drew
out
his
pocket
book
took
from
it
a
pencil
tore
out
a
leaf
and
upon
that
leaf
he
wrote
rapidly
by
the
light
of
the
street
lantern
this
line
m
madeleine
mayor
of
m
sur
m
then
he
ascended
the
stairs
once
more
with
great
strides
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
walked
straight
up
to
the
usher
handed
him
the
paper
and
said
in
an
authoritative
manner
take
this
to
monsieur
le
president
the
usher
took
the
paper
cast
a
glance
upon
it
and
obeyed
chapter
viii
an
entrance
by
favor
although
he
did
not
suspect
the
fact
the
mayor
of
m
sur
m
enjoyed
a
sort
of
celebrity
for
the
space
of
seven
years
his
reputation
for
virtue
had
filled
the
whole
of
bas
boulonnais
it
had
eventually
passed
the
confines
of
a
small
district
and
had
been
spread
abroad
through
two
or
three
neighboring
departments
besides
the
service
which
he
had
rendered
to
the
chief
town
by
resuscitating
the
black
jet
industry
there
was
not
one
out
of
the
hundred
and
forty
communes
of
the
arrondissement
of
m
sur
m
which
was
not
indebted
to
him
for
some
benefit
he
had
even
at
need
contrived
to
aid
and
multiply
the
industries
of
other
arrondissements
it
was
thus
that
he
had
when
occasion
offered
supported
with
his
credit
and
his
funds
the
linen
factory
at
boulogne
the
flax
spinning
industry
at
frevent
and
the
hydraulic
manufacture
of

at

everywhere
the

was
pronounced
with
veneration
arras

douai
envied
the
happy
little
town
of

sur
m
its
mayor
the
councillor
of
the
royal
court
of
douai
who
was
presiding
over
this
session
of
the
assizes
at
arras
was
acquainted
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
with
this
name
which
was
so
profoundly
and
universally
honored
when
the
usher
discreetly
opening
the
door
which
connected
the
council
chamber
with
the
court
room
bent
over
the
back
of
the
president
s
arm
chair
and
handed
him
the
paper
on
which
was
inscribed
the
line
which
we
have
just
perused
adding
the
gentleman
desires
to
be
present
at
the
trial
the
president
with
a
quick
and
deferential
movement
seized
a
pen
and
wrote
a
few
words
at
the
bottom
of
the
paper
and
returned
it
to
the
usher
saying
admit
him
the
unhappy
man
whose
history
we
are
relating
had
remained
near
the
door
of
the
hall
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
attitude
in
which
the
usher
had
left
him
in
the
midst
of
his
revery
he
heard
some
one
saying
to
him
will
monsieur
do
me
the
honor
to
follow
me
it
was
the
same
usher
who
had
turned
his
back
upon
him
but
a
moment
previously
and
who
was
now
bowing
to
the
earth
before
him
at
the
same
time
the
usher
handed
him
the
paper
he
unfolded
it
and
as
he
chanced
to
be
near
the
light
he
could
read
it
the
president
of
the
court
of
assizes
presents
his
respects
to
m
madeleine
he
crushed
the
paper
in
his
hand
as
though
those
words
contained
for
him
a
strange
and
bitter
aftertaste
he
followed
the
usher
a
few
minutes
later
he
found
himself
alone
in
a
sort
of
wainscoted
cabinet
of
severe
aspect
lighted
by
two
wax
candles
placed
upon
a
table
with
a
green
cloth
the
last
words
of
the
usher
who
had
just
quitted
him
still
rang
in
his
ears
monsieur
you
are
now
in
the
council
chamber
you
have
only
to
turn
the
copper
handle
of
yonder
door
and
you
will
find
yourself
in
the
court
room
behind
the
president
s
chair
these
words
were
mingled
in
his
thoughts
with
a
vague
memory
of
narrow
corridors
and
dark
staircases
which
he
had
recently
traversed
the
usher
had
left
him
alone
the
supreme
moment
had
arrived
he
sought
to
collect
his
faculties
but
could
not
it
is
chiefly
at
the
moment
when
there
is
the
greatest
need
for
attaching
them
to
the
painful
realities
of
life
that
the
threads
of
thought
snap
within
the
brain
he
was
in
the
very
place
where
the
judges
deliberated
and
condemned
with
stupid
tranquillity
he
surveyed
this
peaceful
and
terrible
apartment
where
so
many
lives
had
been
broken
which
was
soon
to
ring
with
his
name
and
which
his
fate
was
at
that
moment
traversing
he
stared
at
the
wall
then
he
looked
at
himself
wondering
that
it
should
be
that
chamber
and
that
it
should
be
he
he
had
eaten
nothing
for
four
and
twenty
hours
he
was
worn
out
by
the
jolts
of
the
cart
but
he
was
not
conscious
of
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
felt
nothing
he
approached
a
black
frame
which
was
suspended
on
the
wall
and
which
contained
under
glass
an
ancient
autograph
letter
of
jean
nicolas
pache
mayor
of
paris
and
minister
and
dated
through
an
error
no
doubt
the
9th
of
june
of
the
year
ii
and
in
which
pache
forwarded
to
the
commune
the
list
of
ministers
and
deputies
held
in
arrest
by
them
any
spectator
who
had
chanced
to
see
him
at
that
moment
and
who
had
watched
him
would
have
imagined
doubtless
that
this
letter
struck
him
as
very
curious
for
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
and
he
read
it
two
or
three
times
he
read
it
without
paying
any
attention
to
it
and
unconsciously
he
was
thinking
of
fantine
and
cosette
as
he
dreamed
he
turned
round
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
brass
knob
of
the
door
which
separated
him
from
the
court
of
assizes
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
door
his
glance
calm
at
first
paused
there
remained
fixed
on
that
brass
handle
then
grew
terrified
and
little
by
little
became
impregnated
with
fear
beads
of
perspiration
burst
forth
among
his
hair
and
trickled
down
upon
his
temples
at
a
certain
moment
he
made
that
indescribable
gesture
of
a
sort
of
authority
mingled
with
rebellion
which
is
intended
to
convey
and
which
does
so
well
convey
pardieu
who
compels
me
to
this
then
he
wheeled
briskly
round
caught
sight
of
the
door
through
which
he
had
entered
in
front
of
him
went
to
it
opened
it
and
passed
out
he
was
no
longer
in
that
chamber
he
was
outside
in
a
corridor
a
long
narrow
corridor
broken
by
steps
and
gratings
making
all
sorts
of
angles
lighted
here
and
there
by
lanterns
similar
to
the
night
taper
of
invalids
the
corridor
through
which
he
had
approached
he
breathed
he
listened
not
a
sound
in
front
not
a
sound
behind
him
and
he
fled
as
though
pursued
when
he
had
turned
many
angles
in
this
corridor
he
still
listened
the
same
silence
reigned
and
there
was
the
same
darkness
around
him
he
was
out
of
breath
he
staggered
he
leaned
against
the
wall
the
stone
was
cold
the
perspiration
lay
ice
cold
on
his
brow
he
straightened
himself
up
with
a
shiver
then
there
alone
in
the
darkness
trembling
with
cold
and
with
something
else
too
perchance
he
meditated
he
had
meditated
all
night
long
he
had
meditated
all
the
day
he
heard
within
him
but
one
voice
which
said
alas
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
thus
at
length
he
bowed
his
head
sighed
with
agony
dropped
his
arms
and
retraced
his
steps
he
walked
slowly
and
as
though
crushed
it
seemed
as
though
some
one
had
overtaken
him
in
his
flight
and
was
leading
him
back
he
re
entered
the
council
chamber
the
first
thing
he
caught
sight
of
was
the
knob
of
the
door
this
knob
which
was
round
and
of
polished
brass
shone
like
a
terrible
star
for
him
he
gazed
at
it
as
a
lamb
might
gaze
into
the
eye
of
a
tiger
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
from
time
to
time
he
advanced
a
step
and
approached
the
door
had
he
listened
he
would
have
heard
the
sound
of
the
adjoining
hall
like
a
sort
of
confused
murmur
but
he
did
not
listen
and
he
did
not
hear
suddenly
without
himself
knowing
how
it
happened
he
found
himself
near
the
door
he
grasped
the
knob
convulsively
the
door
opened
he
was
in
the
court
room
chapter
ix
a
place
where
convictions
are
in
process
of
formation
he
advanced
a
pace
closed
the
door
mechanically
behind
him
and
remained
standing
contemplating
what
he
saw
it
was
a
vast
and
badly
lighted
apartment
now
full
of
uproar
now
full
of
silence
where
all
the
apparatus
of
a
criminal
case
with
its
petty
and
mournful
gravity
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
was
in
process
of
development
at
the
one
end
of
the
hall
the
one
where
he
was
were
judges
with
abstracted
air
in
threadbare
robes
who
were
gnawing
their
nails
or
closing
their
eyelids
at
the
other
end
a
ragged
crowd
lawyers
in
all
sorts
of
attitudes
soldiers
with
hard
but
honest
faces
ancient
spotted
woodwork
a
dirty
ceiling
tables
covered
with
serge
that
was
yellow
rather
than
green
doors
blackened
by
handmarks
tap
room
lamps
which
emitted
more
smoke
than
light
suspended
from
nails
in
the
wainscot
on
the
tables
candles
in
brass
candlesticks
darkness
ugliness
sadness
and
from
all
this
there
was
disengaged
an
austere
and
august
impression
for
one
there
felt
that
grand
human
thing
which
is
called
the
law
and
that
grand
divine
thing
which
is
called
justice
no
one
in
all
that
throng
paid
any
attention
to
him
all
glances
were
directed
towards
a
single
point
a
wooden
bench
placed
against
a
small
door
in
the
stretch
of
wall
on
the
president
s
left
on
this
bench
illuminated
by
several
candles
sat
a
man
between
two
gendarmes
this
man
was
the
man
he
did
not
seek
him
he
saw
him
his
eyes
went
thither
naturally
as
though
they
had
known
beforehand
where
that
figure
was
he
thought
he
was
looking
at
himself
grown
old
not
absolutely
the
same
in
face
of
course
but
exactly
similar
in
attitude
and
aspect
with
his
bristling
hair
with
that
wild
and
uneasy
eye
with
that
blouse
just
as
it
was
on
the
day
when
he
entered
d
full
of
hatred
concealing
his
soul
in
that
hideous
mass
of
frightful
thoughts
which
he
had
spent
nineteen
years
in
collecting
on
the
floor
of
the
prison
he
said
to
himself
with
a
shudder
good
god
shall
i
become
like
that
again
this
creature
seemed
to
be
at
least
sixty
there
was
something
indescribably
coarse
stupid
and
frightened
about
him
at
the
sound
made
by
the
opening
door
people
had
drawn
aside
to
make
way
for
him
the
president
had
turned
his
head
and
understanding
that
the
personage
who
had
just
entered
was
the
mayor
of
m
sur
m
he
had
bowed
to
him
the
attorney
general
who
had
seen
m
madeleine
at
m
sur
m
whither
the
duties
of
his
office
had
called
him
more
than
once
recognized
him
and
saluted
him
also
he
had
hardly
perceived
it
he
was
the
victim
of
a
sort
of
hallucination
he
was
watching
judges
clerks
gendarmes
a
throng
of
cruelly
curious
heads
all
these
he
had
already
beheld
once
in
days
gone
by
twenty
seven
years
before
he
had
encountered
those
fatal
things
once
more
there
they
were
they
moved
they
existed
it
was
no
longer
an
effort
of
his
memory
a
mirage
of
his
thought
they
were
real
gendarmes
and
real
judges
a
real
crowd
and
real
men
of
flesh
and
blood
it
was
all
over
he
beheld
the
monstrous
aspects
of
his
past
reappear
and
live
once
more
around
him
with
all
that
there
is
formidable
in
reality
all
this
was
yawning
before
him
he
was
horrified
by
it
he
shut
his
eyes
and
exclaimed
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
soul
never
and
by
a
tragic
play
of
destiny
which
made
all
his
ideas
tremble
and
rendered
him
nearly
mad
it
was
another
self
of
his
that
was
there
all
called
that
man
who
was
being
tried
jean
valjean
under
his
very
eyes
unheard
of
vision
he
had
a
sort
of
representation
of
the
most
horrible
moment
of
his
life
enacted
by
his
spectre
everything
was
there
the
apparatus
was
the
same
the
hour
of
the
night
the
faces
of
the
judges
of
soldiers
and
of
spectators
all
were
the
same
only
above
the
president
s
head
there
hung
a
crucifix
something
which
the
courts
had
lacked
at
the
time
of
his
condemnation
god
had
been
absent
when
he
had
been
judged
there
was
a
chair
behind
him
he
dropped
into
it
terrified
at
the
thought
that
he
might
be
seen
when
he
was
seated
he
took
advantage
of
a
pile
of
cardboard
boxes
which
stood
on
the
judge
s
desk
to
conceal
his
face
from
the
whole
room
he
could
now
see
without
being
seen
he
had
fully
regained
consciousness
of
the
reality
of
things
gradually
he
recovered
he
attained
that
phase
of
composure
where
it
is
possible
to
listen
m
bamatabois
was
one
of
the
jurors
he
looked
for
javert
but
did
not
see
him
the
seat
of
the
witnesses
was
hidden
from
him
by
the
clerk
s
table
and
then
as
we
have
just
said
the
hall
was
sparely
lighted
at
the
moment
of
this
entrance
the
defendant
s
lawyer
had
just
finished
his
plea
the
attention
of
all
was
excited
to
the
highest
pitch
the
affair
had
lasted
for
three
hours
for
three
hours
that
crowd
had
been
watching
a
strange
man
a
miserable
specimen
of
humanity
either
profoundly
stupid
or
profoundly
subtle
gradually
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
a
terrible
likeness
this
man
as
the
reader
already
knows
was
a
vagabond
who
had
been
found
in
a
field
carrying
a
branch
laden
with
ripe
apples
broken
in
the
orchard
of
a
neighbor
called
the
pierron
orchard
who
was
this
man
an
examination
had
been
made
witnesses
had
been
heard
and
they
were
unanimous
light
had
abounded
throughout
the
entire
debate
the
accusation
said
we
have
in
our
grasp
not
only
a
marauder
a
stealer
of
fruit
we
have
here
in
our
hands
a
bandit
an
old
offender
who
has
broken
his
ban
an
ex
convict
a
miscreant
of
the
most
dangerous
description
a
malefactor
named
jean
valjean
whom
justice
has
long
been
in
search
of
and
who
eight
years
ago
on
emerging
from
the
galleys
at
toulon
committed
a
highway
robbery
accompanied
by
violence
on
the
person
of
a
child
a
savoyard
named
little
gervais
a
crime
provided
for
by
article
383
of
the
penal
code
the
right
to
try
him
for
which
we
reserve
hereafter
when
his
identity
shall
have
been
judicially
established
he
has
just
committed
a
fresh
theft
it
is
a
case
of
a
second
offence
condemn
him
for
the
fresh
deed
later
on
he
will
be
judged
for
the
old
crime
in
the
face
of
this
accusation
in
the
face
of
the
unanimity
of
the
witnesses
the
accused
appeared
to
be
astonished
more
than
anything
else
he
made
signs
and
gestures
which
were
meant
to
convey
no
or
else
he
stared
at
the
ceiling
he
spoke
with
difficulty
replied
with
embarrassment
but
his
whole
person
from
head
to
foot
was
a
denial
he
was
an
idiot
in
the
presence
of
all
these
minds
ranged
in
order
of
battle
around
him
and
like
a
stranger
in
the
midst
of
this
society
which
was
seizing
fast
upon
him
nevertheless
it
was
a
question
of
the
most
menacing
future
for
him
the
likeness
increased
every
moment
and
the
entire
crowd
surveyed
with
more
anxiety
than
he
did
himself
that
sentence
freighted
with
calamity
which
descended
ever
closer
over
his
head
there
was
even
a
glimpse
of
a
possibility
afforded
besides
the
galleys
a
possible
death
penalty
in
case
his
identity
were
established
and
the
affair
of
little
gervais
were
to
end
thereafter
in
condemnation
who
was
this
man
what
was
the
nature
of
his
apathy
was
it
imbecility
or
craft
did
he
understand
too
well
or
did
he
not
understand
at
all
these
were
questions
which
divided
the
crowd
and
seemed
to
divide
the
jury
there
was
something
both
terrible
and
puzzling
in
this
case
the
drama
was
not
only
melancholy
it
was
also
obscure
the
counsel
for
the
defence
had
spoken
tolerably
well
in
that
provincial
tongue
which
has
long
constituted
the
eloquence
of
the
bar
and
which
was
formerly
employed
by
all
advocates
at
paris
as
well
as
at
romorantin
or
at
montbrison
and
which
to
day
having
become
classic
is
no
longer
spoken
except
by
the
official
orators
of
magistracy
to
whom
it
is
suited
on
account
of
its
grave
sonorousness
and
its
majestic
stride
a
tongue
in
which
a
husband
is
called
a
consort
and
a
woman
a
spouse
paris
the
centre
of
art
and
civilization
the
king
the
monarch
monseigneur
the
bishop
a
sainted
pontiff
the
district
attorney
the
eloquent
interpreter
of
public
prosecution
the
arguments
the
accents
which
we
have
just
listened
to
the
age
of
louis
xiv
the
grand
age
a
theatre
the
temple
of
melpomene
the
reigning
family
the
august
blood
of
our
kings
a
concert
a
musical
solemnity
the
general
commandant
of
the
province
the
illustrious
warrior
who
etc
the
pupils
in
the
seminary
these
tender
levities
errors
imputed
to
newspapers
the
imposture
which
distills
its
venom
through
the
columns
of
those
organs
etc
the
lawyer
had
accordingly
begun
with
an
explanation
as
to
the
theft
of
the
apples
an
awkward
matter
couched
in
fine
style
but
benigne
bossuet
himself
was
obliged
to
allude
to
a
chicken
in
the
midst
of
a
funeral
oration
and
he
extricated
himself
from
the
situation
in
stately
fashion
the
lawyer
established
the
fact
that
the
theft
of
the
apples
had
not
been
circumstantially
proved
his
client
whom
he
in
his
character
of
counsel
persisted
in
calling
champmathieu
had
not
been
seen
scaling
that
wall
nor
breaking
that
branch
by
any
one
he
had
been
taken
with
that
branch
which
the
lawyer
preferred
to
call
a
bough
in
his
possession
but
he
said
that
he
had
found
it
broken
off
and
lying
on
the
ground
and
had
picked
it
up
where
was
there
any
proof
to
the
contrary
no
doubt
that
branch
had
been
broken
off
and
concealed
after
the
scaling
of
the
wall
then
thrown
away
by
the
alarmed
marauder
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
had
been
a
thief
in
the
case
but
what
proof
was
there
that
that
thief
had
been
champmathieu
one
thing
only
his
character
as
an
ex
convict
the
lawyer
did
not
deny
that
that
character
appeared
to
be
unhappily
well
attested
the
accused
had
resided
at
faverolles
the
accused
had
exercised
the
calling
of
a
tree
pruner
there
the
name
of
champmathieu
might
well
have
had
its
origin
in
jean
mathieu
all
that
was
true
in
short
four
witnesses
recognize
champmathieu
positively
and
without
hesitation
as
that
convict
jean
valjean
to
these
signs
to
this
testimony
the
counsel
could
oppose
nothing
but
the
denial
of
his
client
the
denial
of
an
interested
party
but
supposing
that
he
was
the
convict
jean
valjean
did
that
prove
that
he
was
the
thief
of
the
apples
that
was
a
presumption
at
the
most
not
a
proof
the
prisoner
it
was
true
and
his
counsel
in
good
faith
was
obliged
to
admit
it
had
adopted
a
bad
system
of
defence
he
obstinately
denied
everything
the
theft
and
his
character
of
convict
an
admission
upon
this
last
point
would
certainly
have
been
better
and
would
have
won
for
him
the
indulgence
of
his
judges
the
counsel
had
advised
him
to
do
this
but
the
accused
had
obstinately
refused
thinking
no
doubt
that
he
would
save
everything
by
admitting
nothing
it
was
an
error
but
ought
not
the
paucity
of
this
intelligence
to
be
taken
into
consideration
this
man
was
visibly
stupid
long
continued
wretchedness
in
the
galleys
long
misery
outside
the
galleys
had
brutalized
him
etc
he
defended
himself
badly
was
that
a
reason
for
condemning
him
as
for
the
affair
with
little
gervais
the
counsel
need
not
discuss
it
it
did
not
enter
into
the
case
the
lawyer
wound
up
by
beseeching
the
jury
and
the
court
if
the
identity
of
jean
valjean
appeared
to
them
to
be
evident
to
apply
to
him
the
police
penalties
which
are
provided
for
a
criminal
who
has
broken
his
ban
and
not
the
frightful
chastisement
which
descends
upon
the
convict
guilty
of
a
second
offence
the
district
attorney
answered
the
counsel
for
the
defence
he
was
violent
and
florid
as
district
attorneys
usually
are
he
congratulated
the
counsel
for
the
defence
on
his
loyalty
and
skilfully
took
advantage
of
this
loyalty
he
reached
the
accused
through
all
the
concessions
made
by
his
lawyer
the
advocate
had
seemed
to
admit
that
the
prisoner
was
jean
valjean
he
took
note
of
this
so
this
man
was
jean
valjean
this
point
had
been
conceded
to
the
accusation
and
could
no
longer
be
disputed
here
by
means
of
a
clever
autonomasia
which
went
back
to
the
sources
and
causes
of
crime
the
district
attorney
thundered
against
the
immorality
of
the
romantic
school
then
dawning
under
the
name
of
the
satanic
school
which
had
been
bestowed
upon
it
by
the
critics
of
the
quotidienne
and
the
oriflamme
he
attributed
not
without
some
probability
to
the
influence
of
this
perverse
literature
the
crime
of
champmathieu
or
rather
to
speak
more
correctly
of
jean
valjean
having
exhausted
these
considerations
he
passed
on
to
jean
valjean
himself
who
was
this
jean
valjean
description
of
jean
valjean
a
monster
spewed
forth
etc
the
model
for
this
sort
of
description
is
contained
in
the
tale
of
theramene
which
is
not
useful
to
tragedy
but
which
every
day
renders
great
services
to
judicial
eloquence
the
audience
and
the
jury
shuddered
the
description
finished
the
district
attorney
resumed
with
an
oratorical
turn
calculated
to
raise
the
enthusiasm
of
the
journal
of
the
prefecture
to
the
highest
pitch
on
the
following
day
and
it
is
such
a
man
etc
etc
etc
vagabond
beggar
without
means
of
existence
etc
etc
inured
by
his
past
life
to
culpable
deeds
and
but
little
reformed
by
his
sojourn
in
the
galleys
as
was
proved
by
the
crime
committed
against
little
gervais
etc
etc
it
is
such
a
man
caught
upon
the
highway
in
the
very
act
of
theft
a
few
paces
from
a
wall
that
had
been
scaled
still
holding
in
his
hand
the
object
stolen
who
denies
the
crime
the
theft
the
climbing
the
wall
denies
everything
denies
even
his
own
identity
in
addition
to
a
hundred
other
proofs
to
which
we
will
not
recur
four
witnesses
recognize
him
javert
the
upright
inspector
of
police
javert
and
three
of
his
former
companions
in
infamy
the
convicts
brevet
chenildieu
and
cochepaille
what
does
he
offer
in
opposition
to
this
overwhelming
unanimity
his
denial
what
obduracy
you
will
do
justice
gentlemen
of
the
jury
etc
etc
while
the
district
attorney
was
speaking
the
accused
listened
to
him
open
mouthed
with
a
sort
of
amazement
in
which
some
admiration
was
assuredly
blended
he
was
evidently
surprised
that
a
man
could
talk
like
that
from
time
to
time
at
those
energetic
moments
of
the
prosecutor
s
speech
when
eloquence
which
cannot
contain
itself
overflows
in
a
flood
of
withering
epithets
and
envelops
the
accused
like
a
storm
he
moved
his
head
slowly
from
right
to
left
and
from
left
to
right
in
the
sort
of
mute
and
melancholy
protest
with
which
he
had
contented
himself
since
the
beginning
of
the
argument
two
or
three
times
the
spectators
who
were
nearest
to
him
heard
him
say
in
a
low
voice
that
is
what
comes
of
not
having
asked
m
baloup
the
district
attorney
directed
the
attention
of
the
jury
to
this
stupid
attitude
evidently
deliberate
which
denoted
not
imbecility
but
craft
skill
a
habit
of
deceiving
justice
and
which
set
forth
in
all
its
nakedness
the
profound
perversity
of
this
man
he
ended
by
making
his
reserves
on
the
affair
of
little
gervais
and
demanding
a
severe
sentence
at
that
time
as
the
reader
will
remember
it
was
penal
servitude
for
life
the
counsel
for
the
defence
rose
began
by
complimenting
monsieur
l
avocat
general
on
his
admirable
speech
then
replied
as
best
he
could
but
he
weakened
the
ground
was
evidently
slipping
away
from
under
his
feet
chapter
x
the
system
of
denials
the
moment
for
closing
the
debate
had
arrived
the
president
had
the
accused
stand
up
and
addressed
to
him
the
customary
question
have
you
anything
to
add
to
your
defence
the
man
did
not
appear
to
understand
as
he
stood
there
twisting
in
his
hands
a
terrible
cap
which
he
had
the
president
repeated
the
question
this
time
the
man
heard
it
he
seemed
to
understand
he
made
a
motion
like
a
man
who
is
just
waking
up
cast
his
eyes
about
him
stared
at
the
audience
the
gendarmes
his
counsel
the
jury
the
court
laid
his
monstrous
fist
on
the
rim
of
woodwork
in
front
of
his
bench
took
another
look
and
all
at
once
fixing
his
glance
upon
the
district
attorney
he
began
to
speak
it
was
like
an
eruption
it
seemed
from
the
manner
in
which
the
words
escaped
from
his
mouth
incoherent
impetuous
pell
mell
tumbling
over
each
other
as
though
they
were
all
pressing
forward
to
issue
forth
at
once
he
said
this
is
what
i
have
to
say
that
i
have
been
a
wheelwright
in
paris
and
that
it
was
with
monsieur
baloup
it
is
a
hard
trade
in
the
wheelwright
s
trade
one
works
always
in
the
open
air
in
courtyards
under
sheds
when
the
masters
are
good
never
in
closed
workshops
because
space
is
required
you
see
in
winter
one
gets
so
cold
that
one
beats
one
s
arms
together
to
warm
one
s
self
but
the
masters
don
t
like
it
they
say
it
wastes
time
handling
iron
when
there
is
ice
between
the
paving
stones
is
hard
work
that
wears
a
man
out
quickly
one
is
old
while
he
is
still
quite
young
in
that
trade
at
forty
a
man
is
done
for
i
was
fifty
three
i
was
in
a
bad
state
and
then
workmen
are
so
mean
when
a
man
is
no
longer
young
they
call
him
nothing
but
an
old
bird
old
beast
i
was
not
earning
more
than
thirty
sous
a
day
they
paid
me
as
little
as
possible
the
masters
took
advantage
of
my
age
and
then
i
had
my
daughter
who
was
a
laundress
at
the
river
she
earned
a
little
also
it
sufficed
for
us
two
she
had
trouble
also
all
day
long
up
to
her
waist
in
a
tub
in
rain
in
snow
when
the
wind
cuts
your
face
when
it
freezes
it
is
all
the
same
you
must
still
wash
there
are
people
who
have
not
much
linen
and
wait
until
late
if
you
do
not
wash
you
lose
your
custom
the
planks
are
badly
joined
and
water
drops
on
you
from
everywhere
you
have
your
petticoats
all
damp
above
and
below
that
penetrates
she
has
also
worked
at
the
laundry
of
the
enfants
rouges
where
the
water
comes
through
faucets
you
are
not
in
the
tub
there
you
wash
at
the
faucet
in
front
of
you
and
rinse
in
a
basin
behind
you
as
it
is
enclosed
you
are
not
so
cold
but
there
is
that
hot
steam
which
is
terrible
and
which
ruins
your
eyes
she
came
home
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
went
to
bed
at
once
she
was
so
tired
her
husband
beat
her
she
is
dead
we
have
not
been
very
happy
she
was
a
good
girl
who
did
not
go
to
the
ball
and
who
was
very
peaceable
i
remember
one
shrove
tuesday
when
she
went
to
bed
at
eight
o
clock
there
i
am
telling
the
truth
you
have
only
to
ask
ah
yes
how
stupid
i
am
paris
is
a
gulf
who
knows
father
champmathieu
there
but
m
baloup
does
i
tell
you
go
see
at
m
baloup
s
and
after
all
i
don
t
know
what
is
wanted
of
me
the
man
ceased
speaking
and
remained
standing
he
had
said
these
things
in
a
loud
rapid
hoarse
voice
with
a
sort
of
irritated
and
savage
ingenuousness
once
he
paused
to
salute
some
one
in
the
crowd
the
sort
of
affirmations
which
he
seemed
to
fling
out
before
him
at
random
came
like
hiccoughs
and
to
each
he
added
the
gesture
of
a
wood
cutter
who
is
splitting
wood
when
he
had
finished
the
audience
burst
into
a
laugh
he
stared
at
the
public
and
perceiving
that
they
were
laughing
and
not
understanding
why
he
began
to
laugh
himself
it
was
inauspicious
the
president
an
attentive
and
benevolent
man
raised
his
voice
he
reminded
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
the
sieur
baloup
formerly
a
master
wheelwright
with
whom
the
accused
stated
that
he
had
served
had
been
summoned
in
vain
he
had
become
bankrupt
and
was
not
to
be
found
then
turning
to
the
accused
he
enjoined
him
to
listen
to
what
he
was
about
to
say
and
added
you
are
in
a
position
where
reflection
is
necessary
the
gravest
presumptions
rest
upon
you
and
may
induce
vital
results
prisoner
in
your
own
interests
i
summon
you
for
the
last
time
to
explain
yourself
clearly
on
two
points
in
the
first
place
did
you
or
did
you
not
climb
the
wall
of
the
pierron
orchard
break
the
branch
and
steal
the
apples
that
is
to
say
commit
the
crime
of
breaking
in
and
theft
in
the
second
place
are
you
the
discharged
convict
jean
valjean
yes
or
no
the
prisoner
shook
his
head
with
a
capable
air
like
a
man
who
has
thoroughly
understood
and
who
knows
what
answer
he
is
going
to
make
he
opened
his
mouth
turned
towards
the
president
and
said
in
the
first
place
then
he
stared
at
his
cap
stared
at
the
ceiling
and
held
his
peace
prisoner
said
the
district
attorney
in
a
severe
voice
pay
attention
you
are
not
answering
anything
that
has
been
asked
of
you
your
embarrassment
condemns
you
it
is
evident
that
your
name
is
not
champmathieu
that
you
are
the
convict
jean
valjean
concealed
first
under
the
name
of
jean
mathieu
which
was
the
name
of
his
mother
that
you
went
to
auvergne
that
you
were
born
at
faverolles
where
you
were
a
pruner
of
trees
it
is
evident
that
you
have
been
guilty
of
entering
and
of
the
theft
of
ripe
apples
from
the
pierron
orchard
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
will
form
their
own
opinion
illustration
father
champmathieu
on
trial
the
prisoner
had
finally
resumed
his
seat
he
arose
abruptly
when
the
district
attorney
had
finished
and
exclaimed
you
are
very
wicked
that
you
are
this
what
i
wanted
to
say
i
could
not
find
words
for
it
at
first
i
have
stolen
nothing
i
am
a
man
who
does
not
have
something
to
eat
every
day
i
was
coming
from
ailly
i
was
walking
through
the
country
after
a
shower
which
had
made
the
whole
country
yellow
even
the
ponds
were
overflowed
and
nothing
sprang
from
the
sand
any
more
but
the
little
blades
of
grass
at
the
wayside
i
found
a
broken
branch
with
apples
on
the
ground
i
picked
up
the
branch
without
knowing
that
it
would
get
me
into
trouble
i
have
been
in
prison
and
they
have
been
dragging
me
about
for
the
last
three
months
more
than
that
i
cannot
say
people
talk
against
me
they
tell
me
answer
the
gendarme
who
is
a
good
fellow
nudges
my
elbow
and
says
to
me
in
a
low
voice
come
answer
i
don
t
know
how
to
explain
i
have
no
education
i
am
a
poor
man
that
is
where
they
wrong
me
because
they
do
not
see
this
i
have
not
stolen
i
picked
up
from
the
ground
things
that
were
lying
there
you
say
jean
valjean
jean
mathieu

don
t

those
persons

worked
for
m
baloup
boulevard
de
l
hopital

champmathieu

very
clever
to
tell
me
where
i
was
born

don
t
know
myself
it
s
not
everybody
who
has
a
house
in
which
to
come
into
the
world
that
would
be
too
convenient
i
think
that
my
father
and
mother
were
people
who
strolled
along
the
highways
i
know
nothing
different
when
i
was
a
child
they
called
me
young
fellow
now
they
call
me
old
fellow
those
are
my
baptismal
names
take
that
as
you
like
i
have
been
in
auvergne
i
have
been
at
faverolles
pardi
well
can
t
a
man
have
been
in
auvergne
or
at
faverolles
without
having
been
in
the
galleys
i
tell
you
that
i
have
not
stolen
and
that
i
am
father
champmathieu
i
have
been
with
m
baloup
i
have
had
a
settled
residence
you
worry
me
with
your
nonsense
there
why
is
everybody
pursuing
me
so
furiously
the
district
attorney
had
remained
standing
he
addressed
the
president
monsieur
le
president
in
view
of
the
confused
but
exceedingly
clever
denials
of
the
prisoner
who
would
like
to
pass
himself
off
as
an
idiot
but
who
will
not
succeed
in
so
doing
we
shall
attend
to
that
we
demand
that
it
shall
please
you
and
that
it
shall
please
the
court
to
summon
once
more
into
this
place
the
convicts
brevet
cochepaille
and
chenildieu
and
police
inspector
javert
and
question
them
for
the
last
time
as
to
the
identity
of
the
prisoner
with
the
convict
jean
valjean
i
would
remind
the
district
attorney
said
the
president
that
police
inspector
javert
recalled
by
his
duties
to
the
capital
of
a
neighboring
arrondissement
left
the
court
room
and
the
town
as
soon
as
he
had
made
his
deposition
we
have
accorded
him
permission
with
the
consent
of
the
district
attorney
and
of
the
counsel
for
the
prisoner
that
is
true
mr
president
responded
the
district
attorney
in
the
absence
of
sieur
javert
i
think
it
my
duty
to
remind
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
of
what
he
said
here
a
few
hours
ago
javert
is
an
estimable
man
who
does
honor
by
his
rigorous
and
strict
probity
to
inferior
but
important
functions
these
are
the
terms
of
his
deposition
i
do
not
even
stand
in
need
of
circumstantial
proofs
and
moral
presumptions
to
give
the
lie
to
the
prisoner
s
denial
i
recognize
him
perfectly
the
name
of
this
man
is
not
champmathieu
he
is
an
ex
convict
named
jean
valjean
and
is
very
vicious
and
much
to
be
feared
it
is
only
with
extreme
regret
that
he
was
released
at
the
expiration
of
his
term
he
underwent
nineteen
years
of
penal
servitude
for
theft
he
made
five
or
six
attempts
to
escape
besides
the
theft
from
little
gervais
and
from
the
pierron
orchard
i
suspect
him
of
a
theft
committed
in
the
house
of
his
grace
the
late
bishop
of
d
i
often
saw
him
at
the
time
when
i
was
adjutant
of
the
galley
guard
at
the
prison
in
toulon
i
repeat
that
i
recognize
him
perfectly
this
extremely
precise
statement
appeared
to
produce
a
vivid
impression
on
the
public
and
on
the
jury
the
district
attorney
concluded
by
insisting
that
in
default
of
javert
the
three
witnesses
brevet
chenildieu
and
cochepaille
should
be
heard
once
more
and
solemnly
interrogated
the
president
transmitted
the
order
to
an
usher
and
a
moment
later
the
door
of
the
witnesses
room
opened
the
usher
accompanied
by
a
gendarme
ready
to
lend
him
armed
assistance
introduced
the
convict
brevet
the
audience
was
in
suspense
and
all
breasts
heaved
as
though
they
had
contained
but
one
soul
the
ex
convict
brevet
wore
the
black
and
gray
waistcoat
of
the
central
prisons
brevet
was
a
person
sixty
years
of
age
who
had
a
sort
of
business
man
s
face
and
the
air
of
a
rascal
the
two
sometimes
go
together
in
prison
whither
fresh
misdeeds
had
led
him
he
had
become
something
in
the
nature
of
a
turnkey
he
was
a
man
of
whom
his
superiors
said
he
tries
to
make
himself
of
use
the
chaplains
bore
good
testimony
as
to
his
religious
habits
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
passed
under
the
restoration
brevet
said
the
president
you
have
undergone
an
ignominious
sentence
and
you
cannot
take
an
oath
brevet
dropped
his
eyes
nevertheless
continued
the
president
even
in
the
man
whom
the
law
has
degraded
there
may
remain
when
the
divine
mercy
permits
it
a
sentiment
of
honor
and
of
equity
it
is
to
this
sentiment
that
i
appeal
at
this
decisive
hour
if
it
still
exists
in
you
and
i
hope
it
does
reflect
before
replying
to
me
consider
on
the
one
hand
this
man
whom
a
word
from
you
may
ruin
on
the
other
hand
justice
which
a
word
from
you
may
enlighten
the
instant
is
solemn
there
is
still
time
to
retract
if
you
think
you
have
been
mistaken
rise
prisoner
brevet
take
a
good
look
at
the
accused
recall
your
souvenirs
and
tell
us
on
your
soul
and
conscience
if
you
persist
in
recognizing
this
man
as
your
former
companion
in
the
galleys
jean
valjean
brevet
looked
at
the
prisoner
then
turned
towards
the
court
yes
mr
president
i
was
the
first
to
recognize
him
and
i
stick
to
it
that
man
is
jean
valjean
who
entered
at
toulon
in
1796
and
left
in
1815
i
left
a
year
later
he
has
the
air
of
a
brute
now
but
it
must
be
because
age
has
brutalized
him
he
was
sly
at
the
galleys
i
recognize
him
positively
take
your
seat
said
the
president
prisoner
remain
standing
chenildieu
was
brought
in
a
prisoner
for
life
as
was
indicated
by
his
red
cassock
and
his
green
cap
he
was
serving
out
his
sentence
at
the
galleys
of
toulon
whence
he
had
been
brought
for
this
case
he
was
a
small
man
of
about
fifty
brisk
wrinkled
frail
yellow
brazen
faced
feverish
who
had
a
sort
of
sickly
feebleness
about
all
his
limbs
and
his
whole
person
and
an
immense
force
in
his
glance
his
companions
in
the
galleys
had
nicknamed
him
i
deny
god
je
nie
dieu
chenildieu
the
president
addressed
him
in
nearly
the
same
words
which
he
had
used
to
brevet
at
the
moment
when
he
reminded
him
of
his
infamy
which
deprived
him
of
the
right
to
take
an
oath
chenildieu
raised
his
head
and
looked
the
crowd
in
the
face
the
president
invited
him
to
reflection
and
asked
him
as
he
had
asked
brevet
if
he
persisted
in
recognition
of
the
prisoner
chenildieu
burst
out
laughing
pardieu
as
if
i
didn
t
recognize
him
we
were
attached
to
the
same
chain
for
five
years
so
you
are
sulking
old
fellow
go
take
your
seat
said
the
president
the
usher
brought
in
cochepaille
he
was
another
convict
for
life
who
had
come
from
the
galleys
and
was
dressed
in
red
like
chenildieu
was
a
peasant
from
lourdes
and
a
half
bear
of
the
pyrenees
he
had
guarded
the
flocks
among
the
mountains
and
from
a
shepherd
he
had
slipped
into
a
brigand
cochepaille
was
no
less
savage
and
seemed
even
more
stupid
than
the
prisoner
he
was
one
of
those
wretched
men
whom
nature
has
sketched
out
for
wild
beasts
and
on
whom
society
puts
the
finishing
touches
as
convicts
in
the
galleys
the
president
tried
to
touch
him
with
some
grave
and
pathetic
words
and
asked
him
as
he
had
asked
the
other
two
if
he
persisted
without
hesitation
or
trouble
in
recognizing
the
man
who
was
standing
before
him
he
is
jean
valjean
said
cochepaille
he
was
even
called
jean
the
screw
because
he
was
so
strong
each
of
these
affirmations
from
these
three
men
evidently
sincere
and
in
good
faith
had
raised
in
the
audience
a
murmur
of
bad
augury
for
the
prisoner
a
murmur
which
increased
and
lasted
longer
each
time
that
a
fresh
declaration
was
added
to
the
proceeding
the
prisoner
had
listened
to
them
with
that
astounded
face
which
was
according
to
the
accusation
his
principal
means
of
defence
at
the
first
the
gendarmes
his
neighbors
had
heard
him
mutter
between
his
teeth
ah
well
he
s
a
nice
one
after
the
second
he
said
a
little
louder
with
an
air
that
was
almost
that
of
satisfaction
good
at
the
third
he
cried
famous
the
president
addressed
him
have
you
heard
prisoner
what
have
you
to
say
he
replied
i
say
famous
an
uproar
broke
out
among
the
audience
and
was
communicated
to
the
jury
it
was
evident
that
the
man
was
lost
ushers
said
the
president
enforce
silence
i
am
going
to
sum
up
the
arguments
at
that
moment
there
was
a
movement
just
beside
the
president
a
voice
was
heard
crying
brevet
chenildieu
cochepaille
look
here
all
who
heard
that
voice
were
chilled
so
lamentable
and
terrible
was
it
all
eyes
were
turned
to
the
point
whence
it
had
proceeded
a
man
placed
among
the
privileged
spectators
who
were
seated
behind
the
court
had
just
risen
had
pushed
open
the
half
door
which
separated
the
tribunal
from
the
audience
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
the
president
the
district
attorney
m
bamatabois
twenty
persons
recognized
him
and
exclaimed
in
concert
m
madeleine
chapter
xi
champmathieu
more
and
more
astonished
it
was
he
in
fact
the
clerk
s
lamp
illumined
his
countenance
he
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
there
was
no
disorder
in
his
clothing
his
coat
was
carefully
buttoned
he
was
very
pale
and
he
trembled
slightly
his
hair
which
had
still
been
gray
on
his
arrival
in
arras
was
now
entirely
white
it
had
turned
white
during
the
hour
he
had
sat
there
all
heads
were
raised
the
sensation
was
indescribable
there
was
a
momentary
hesitation
in
the
audience
the
voice
had
been
so
heart
rending
the
man
who
stood
there
appeared
so
calm
that
they
did
not
understand
at
first
they
asked
themselves
whether
he
had
indeed
uttered
that
cry
they
could
not
believe
that
that
tranquil
man
had
been
the
one
to
give
that
terrible
outcry
this
indecision
only
lasted
a
few
seconds
even
before
the
president
and
the
district
attorney
could
utter
a
word
before
the
ushers
and
the
gendarmes
could
make
a
gesture
the
man
whom
all
still
called
at
that
moment
m
madeleine
had
advanced
towards
the
witnesses
cochepaille
brevet
and
chenildieu
do
you
not
recognize
me
said
he
all
three
remained
speechless
and
indicated
by
a
sign
of
the
head
that
they
did
not
know
him
cochepaille
who
was
intimidated
made
a
military
salute
m

turned
towards
the
jury
and
the
court
and
said
in
a
gentle
voice
gentlemen
of
the
jury
order
the
prisoner
to
be
released
mr
president
have
me
arrested
he
is
not
the
man
whom
you
are
in
search
of
it
is
i
i
am
jean
valjean
not
a
mouth
breathed
the
first
commotion
of
astonishment
had
been
followed
by
a
silence
like
that
of
the
grave
those
within
the
hall
experienced
that
sort
of
religious
terror
which
seizes
the
masses
when
something
grand
has
been
done
in
the
meantime
the
face
of
the
president
was
stamped
with
sympathy
and
sadness
he
had
exchanged
a
rapid
sign
with
the
district
attorney
and
a
few
low
toned
words
with
the
assistant
judges
he
addressed
the
public
and
asked
in
accents
which
all
understood
is
there
a
physician
present
the
district
attorney
took
the
word
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
very
strange
and
unexpected
incident
which
disturbs
the
audience
inspires
us
like
yourselves
only
with
a
sentiment
which
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
express
you
all
know
by
reputation
at
least
the
honorable
m
madeleine
mayor
of

if
there
is
a
physician
in
the
audience
we
join
the
president
in
requesting
him
to
attend
to
m
madeleine
and
to
conduct
him
to
his
home
m
madeleine
did
not
allow
the
district
attorney
to
finish
he
interrupted
him
in
accents
full
of
suavity
and
authority
these
are
the
words
which
he
uttered
here
they
are
literally
as
they
were
written
down
immediately
after
the
trial
by
one
of
the
witnesses
to
this
scene
and
as
they
now
ring
in
the
ears
of
those
who
heard
them
nearly
forty
years
ago
i
thank
you
mr
district
attorney
but
i
am
not
mad
you
shall
see
you
were
on
the
point
of
committing
a
great
error
release
this
man
i
am
fulfilling
a
duty
i
am
that
miserable
criminal
i
am
the
only
one
here
who
sees
the
matter
clearly
and
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
god
who
is
on
high
looks
down
on
what
i
am
doing
at
this
moment
and
that
suffices
you
can
take
me
for
here
i
am
but
i
have
done
my
best
i
concealed
myself
under
another
name
i
have
become
rich
i
have
become
a
mayor
i
have
tried
to
re
enter
the
ranks
of
the
honest
it
seems
that
that
is
not
to
be
done
in
short
there
are
many
things
which
i
cannot
tell
i
will
not
narrate
the
story
of
my
life
to
you
you
will
hear
it
one
of
these
days
i
robbed
monseigneur
the
bishop
it
is
true
it
is
true
that
i
robbed
little
gervais
they
were
right
in
telling
you
that
jean
valjean
was
a
very
vicious
wretch
perhaps
it
was
not
altogether
his
fault
listen
honorable
judges
a
man
who
has
been
so
greatly
humbled
as
i
have
has
neither
any
remonstrances
to
make
to
providence
nor
any
advice
to
give
to
society
but
you
see
the
infamy
from
which
i
have
tried
to
escape
is
an
injurious
thing
the
galleys
make
the
convict
what
he
is
reflect
upon
that
if
you
please
before
going
to
the
galleys
i
was
a
poor
peasant
with
very
little
intelligence
a
sort
of
idiot
the
galleys
wrought
a
change
in
me
i
was
stupid
i
became
vicious
i
was
a
block
of
wood
i
became
a
firebrand
later
on
indulgence
and
kindness
saved
me
as
severity
had
ruined
me
but
pardon
me
you
cannot
understand
what
i
am
saying
you
will
find
at
my
house
among
the
ashes
in
the
fireplace
the
forty
sou
piece
which
i
stole
seven
years
ago
from
little
gervais
i
have
nothing
farther
to
add
take
me
good
god
the
district
attorney
shakes
his
head
you
say
m
madeleine
has
gone
mad
you
do
not
believe
me
that
is
distressing
do
not
at
least
condemn
this
man
what
these
men
do
not
recognize
me
i
wish
javert
were
here
he
would
recognize
me
nothing
can
reproduce
the
sombre
and
kindly
melancholy
of
tone
which
accompanied
these
words
he
turned
to
the
three
convicts
and
said
well
i
recognize
you
do
you
remember
brevet
he
paused
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
said
do
you
remember
the
knitted
suspenders
with
a
checked
pattern
which
you
wore
in
the
galleys
brevet
gave
a
start
of
surprise
and
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
with
a
frightened
air
he
continued
chenildieu
you
who
conferred
on
yourself
the
name
of
jenie
dieu
your
whole
right
shoulder
bears
a
deep
burn
because
you
one
day
laid
your
shoulder
against
the
chafing
dish
full
of
coals
in
order
to
efface
the
three
letters
t
f
p
which
are
still
visible
nevertheless
answer
is
this
true
it
is
true
said
chenildieu
he
addressed
himself
to
cochepaille
cochepaille
you
have
near
the
bend
in
your
left
arm
a
date
stamped
in
blue
letters
with
burnt
powder
the
date
is
that
of
the
landing
of
the
emperor
at
cannes
march
1
1815
pull
up
your
sleeve
cochepaille
pushed
up
his
sleeve
all
eyes
were
focused
on
him
and
on
his
bare
arm
a
gendarme
held
a
light
close
to
it
there
was
the
date
the
unhappy
man
turned
to
the
spectators
and
the
judges
with
a
smile
which
still
rends
the
hearts
of
all
who
saw
it
whenever
they
think
of
it
it
was
a
smile
of
triumph
it
was
also
a
smile
of
despair
you
see
plainly
he
said
that
i
am
jean
valjean
in
that
chamber
there
were
no
longer
either
judges
accusers
nor
gendarmes
there
was
nothing
but
staring
eyes
and
sympathizing
hearts
no
one
recalled
any
longer
the
part
that
each
might
be
called
upon
to
play
the
district
attorney
forgot
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
the
president
that
he
was
there
to
preside
the
counsel
for
the
defence
that
he
was
there
to
defend
it
was
a
striking
circumstance
that
no
question
was
put
that
no
authority
intervened
the
peculiarity
of
sublime
spectacles
is
that
they
capture
all
souls
and
turn
witnesses
into
spectators
no
one
probably
could
have
explained
what
he
felt
no
one
probably
said
to
himself
that
he
was
witnessing
the
splendid
outburst
of
a
grand
light
all
felt
themselves
inwardly
dazzled
it
was
evident
that
they
had
jean
valjean
before
their
eyes
that
was
clear
the
appearance
of
this
man
had
sufficed
to
suffuse
with
light
that
matter
which
had
been
so
obscure
but
a
moment
previously
without
any
further
explanation
the
whole
crowd
as
by
a
sort
of
electric
revelation
understood
instantly
and
at
a
single
glance
the
simple
and
magnificent
history
of
a
man
who
was
delivering
himself
up
so
that
another
man
might
not
be
condemned
in
his
stead
the
details
the
hesitations
little
possible
oppositions
were
swallowed
up
in
that
vast
and
luminous
fact
it
was
an
impression
which
vanished
speedily
but
which
was
irresistible
at
the
moment
i
do
not
wish
to
disturb
the
court
further
resumed
jean
valjean
i
shall
withdraw
since
you
do
not
arrest
me
i
have
many
things
to
do
the
district
attorney
knows
who
i
am
he
knows
whither
i
am
going
he
can
have
me
arrested
when
he
likes
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
door
not
a
voice
was
raised
not
an
arm
extended
to
hinder
him
all
stood
aside
at
that
moment
there
was
about
him
that
divine
something
which
causes
multitudes
to
stand
aside
and
make
way
for
a
man
he
traversed
the
crowd
slowly
it
was
never
known
who
opened
the
door
but
it
is
certain
that
he
found
the
door
open
when
he
reached
it
on
arriving
there
he
turned
round
and
said
i
am
at
your
command
mr
district
attorney
then
he
addressed
the
audience
all
of
you
all
who
are
present
consider
me
worthy
of
pity
do
you
not
good
god
when
i
think
of
what
i
was
on
the
point
of
doing
i
consider
that
i
am
to
be
envied
nevertheless
i
should
have
preferred
not
to
have
had
this
occur
he
withdrew
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
as
it
had
opened
for
those
who
do
certain
sovereign
things
are
always
sure
of
being
served
by
some
one
in
the
crowd
less
than
an
hour
after
this
the
verdict
of
the
jury
freed
the
said
champmathieu
from
all
accusations
and
champmathieu
being
at
once
released
went
off
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
thinking
that
all
men
were
fools
and
comprehending
nothing
of
this
vision
book

a

in

contemplates
his
hair
the
day
had
begun
to
dawn
fantine
had
passed
a
sleepless
and
feverish
night
filled
with
happy
visions
at
daybreak
she
fell
asleep
sister
simplice
who
had
been
watching
with
her
availed
herself
of
this
slumber
to
go
and
prepare
a
new
potion
of
chinchona
the
worthy
sister
had
been
in
the
laboratory
of
the
infirmary
but
a
few
moments
bending
over
her
drugs
and
phials
and
scrutinizing
things
very
closely
on
account
of
the
dimness
which
the
half
light
of
dawn
spreads
over
all
objects
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
uttered
a
faint
shriek
m
madeleine
stood
before
her
he
had
just
entered
silently
is
it
you
mr
mayor
she
exclaimed
he
replied
in
a
low
voice
how
is
that
poor
woman
not
so
bad
just
now
but
we
have
been
very
uneasy
she
explained
to
him
what
had
passed
that
fantine
had
been
very
ill
the
day
before
and
that
she
was
better
now
because
she
thought
that
the
mayor
had
gone
to
montfermeil
to
get
her
child
the
sister
dared
not
question
the
mayor
but
she
perceived
plainly
from
his
air
that
he
had
not
come
from
there
all
that
is
good
said
he
you
were
right
not
to
undeceive
her
yes
responded
the
sister
but
now
mr
mayor
she
will
see
you
and
will
not
see
her
child
what
shall
we
say
to
her
he
reflected
for
a
moment
god
will
inspire
us
said
he
but
we
cannot
tell
a
lie
murmured
the
sister
half
aloud
it
was
broad
daylight
in
the
room
the
light
fell
full
on
m
madeleine
s
face
the
sister
chanced
to
raise
her
eyes
to
it
good
god
sir
she
exclaimed
what
has
happened
to
you
your
hair
is
perfectly
white
white
said
he
sister
simplice
had
no
mirror
she
rummaged
in
a
drawer
and
pulled
out
the
little
glass
which
the
doctor
of
the
infirmary
used
to
see
whether
a
patient
was
dead
and
whether
he
no
longer
breathed
m
madeleine
took
the
mirror
looked
at
his
hair
and
said
well
he
uttered
the
word
indifferently
and
as
though
his
mind
were
on
something
else
the
sister
felt
chilled
by
something
strange
of
which
she
caught
a
glimpse
in
all
this
he
inquired
can
i
see
her
is
not
monsieur
le
maire
going
to
have
her
child
brought
back
to
her
said
the
sister
hardly
venturing
to
put
the
question
of
course
but
it
will
take
two
or
three
days
at
least
if
she
were
not
to
see
monsieur
le
maire
until
that
time
went
on
the
sister
timidly
she
would
not
know
that
monsieur
le
maire
had
returned
and
it
would
be
easy
to
inspire
her
with
patience
and
when
the
child
arrived
she
would
naturally
think
monsieur
le
maire
had
just
come
with
the
child
we
should
not
have
to
enact
a
lie
m
madeleine
seemed
to
reflect
for
a
few
moments
then
he
said
with
his
calm
gravity
no
sister
i
must
see
her
i
may
perhaps
be
in
haste
the
nun
did
not
appear
to
notice
this
word
perhaps
which
communicated
an
obscure
and
singular
sense
to
the
words
of
the
mayor
s
speech
she
replied
lowering
her
eyes
and
her
voice
respectfully
in
that
case
she
is
asleep
but
monsieur
le
maire
may
enter
he
made
some
remarks
about
a
door
which
shut
badly
and
the
noise
of
which
might
awaken
the
sick
woman
then
he
entered
fantine
s
chamber
approached
the
bed
and
drew
aside
the
curtains
she
was
asleep
her
breath
issued
from
her
breast
with
that
tragic
sound
which
is
peculiar
to
those
maladies
and
which
breaks
the
hearts
of
mothers
when
they
are
watching
through
the
night
beside
their
sleeping
child
who
is
condemned
to
death
but
this
painful
respiration
hardly
troubled
a
sort
of
ineffable
serenity
which
overspread
her
countenance
and
which
transfigured
her
in
her
sleep
her
pallor
had
become
whiteness
her
cheeks
were
crimson
her
long
golden
lashes
the
only
beauty
of
her
youth
and
her
virginity
which
remained
to
her
palpitated
though
they
remained
closed
and
drooping
her
whole
person
was
trembling
with
an
indescribable
unfolding
of
wings
all
ready
to
open
wide
and
bear
her
away
which
could
be
felt
as
they
rustled
though
they
could
not
be
seen
to
see
her
thus
one
would
never
have
dreamed
that
she
was
an
invalid
whose
life
was
almost
despaired
of
she
resembled
rather
something
on
the
point
of
soaring
away
than
something
on
the
point
of
dying
the
branch
trembles
when
a
hand
approaches
it
to
pluck
a
flower
and
seems
to
both
withdraw
and
to
offer
itself
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
human
body
has
something
of
this
tremor
when
the
instant
arrives
in
which
the
mysterious
fingers
of
death
are
about
to
pluck
the
soul
m
madeleine
remained
for
some
time
motionless
beside
that
bed
gazing
in
turn
upon
the
sick
woman
and
the
crucifix
as
he
had
done
two
months
before
on
the
day
when
he
had
come
for
the
first
time
to
see
her
in
that
asylum
they
were
both
still
there
in
the
same
attitude
she
sleeping
he
praying
only
now
after
the
lapse
of
two
months
her
hair
was
gray
and
his
was
white
the
sister
had
not
entered
with
him
he
stood
beside
the
bed
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
as
though
there
were
some
one
in
the
chamber
whom
he
must
enjoin
to
silence
she
opened
her
eyes
saw
him
and
said
quietly
with
a
smile
and
cosette
chapter
ii
fantine
happy
she
made
no
movement
of
either
surprise
or
of
joy
she
was
joy
itself
that
simple
question
and
cosette
was
put
with
so
profound
a
faith
with
so
much
certainty
with
such
a
complete
absence
of
disquiet
and
of
doubt
that
he
found
not
a
word
of
reply
she
continued
i
knew
that
you
were
there
i
was
asleep
but
i
saw
you
i
have
seen
you
for
a
long
long
time
i
have
been
following
you
with
my
eyes
all
night
long
you
were
in
a
glory
and
you
had
around
you
all
sorts
of
celestial
forms
he
raised
his
glance
to
the
crucifix
but
she
resumed
tell
me
where
cosette
is
why
did
not
you
place
her
on
my
bed
against
the
moment
of
my
waking
he
made
some
mechanical
reply
which
he
was
never
afterwards
able
to
recall
fortunately
the
doctor
had
been
warned
and
he
now
made
his
appearance
he
came
to
the
aid
of
m
madeleine
calm
yourself
my
child
said
the
doctor
your
child
is
here
fantine
s
eyes
beamed
and
filled
her
whole
face
with
light
she
clasped
her
hands
with
an
expression
which
contained
all
that
is
possible
to
prayer
in
the
way
of
violence
and
tenderness
oh
she
exclaimed
bring
her
to
me
touching
illusion
of
a
mother
cosette
was
for
her
still
the
little
child
who
is
carried
not
yet
said
the
doctor
not
just
now
you
still
have
some
fever
the
sight
of
your
child
would
agitate
you
and
do
you
harm
you
must
be
cured
first
she
interrupted
him
impetuously
but
i
am
cured
oh
i
tell
you
that
i
am
cured
what
an
ass
that
doctor
is
the
idea
i
want
to
see
my
child
you
see
said
the
doctor
how
excited
you
become
so
long
as
you
are
in
this
state
i
shall
oppose
your
having
your
child
it
is
not
enough
to
see
her
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
live
for
her
when
you
are
reasonable
i
will
bring
her
to
you
myself
the
poor
mother
bowed
her
head
i
beg
your
pardon
doctor
i
really
beg
your
pardon
formerly
i
should
never
have
spoken
as
i
have
just
done
so
many
misfortunes
have
happened
to
me
that
i
sometimes
do
not
know
what
i
am
saying
i
understand
you
you
fear
the
emotion
i
will
wait
as
long
as
you
like
but
i
swear
to
you
that
it
would
not
have
harmed
me
to
see
my
daughter
i
have
been
seeing
her
i
have
not
taken
my
eyes
from
her
since
yesterday
evening
do
you
know
if
she
were
brought
to
me
now
i
should
talk
to
her
very
gently
that
is
all
is
it
not
quite
natural
that
i
should
desire
to
see
my
daughter
who
has
been
brought
to
me
expressly
from
montfermeil
i
am
not
angry
i
know
well
that
i
am
about
to
be
happy
all
night
long
i
have
seen
white
things
and
persons
who
smiled
at
me
when
monsieur
le
docteur
pleases
he
shall
bring
me
cosette
i
have
no
longer
any
fever
i
am
well
i
am
perfectly
conscious
that
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
any
more
but
i
am
going
to
behave
as
though
i
were
ill
and
not
stir
to
please
these
ladies
here
when
it
is
seen
that
i
am
very
calm
they
will
say
she
must
have
her
child
m
madeleine
was
sitting
on
a
chair
beside
the
bed
she
turned
towards
him
she
was
making
a
visible
effort
to
be
calm
and
very
good
as
she
expressed
it
in
the
feebleness
of
illness
which
resembles
infancy
in
order
that
seeing
her
so
peaceable
they
might
make
no
difficulty
about
bringing
cosette
to
her
but
while
she
controlled
herself
she
could
not
refrain
from
questioning
m
madeleine
did
you
have
a
pleasant
trip
monsieur
le
maire
oh
how
good
you
were
to
go
and
get
her
for
me
only
tell
me
how
she
is
did
she
stand
the
journey
well
alas
she
will
not
recognize
me
she
must
have
forgotten
me
by
this
time
poor
darling
children
have
no
memories
they
are
like
birds
a
child
sees
one
thing
to
day
and
another
thing
to
morrow
and
thinks
of
nothing
any
longer
and
did
she
have
white
linen
did
those
thenardiers
keep
her
clean
how
have
they
fed
her
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
i
have
suffered
putting
such
questions
as
that
to
myself
during
all
the
time
of
my
wretchedness
now
it
is
all
past
i
am
happy
oh
how
i
should
like
to
see
her
do
you
think
her
pretty
monsieur
le
maire
is
not
my
daughter
beautiful
you
must
have
been
very
cold
in
that
diligence
could
she
not
be
brought
for
just
one
little
instant
she
might
be
taken
away
directly
afterwards
tell
me
you
are
the
master
it
could
be
so
if
you
chose
he
took
her
hand
cosette
is
beautiful
he
said
cosette
is
well
you
shall
see
her
soon
but
calm
yourself
you
are
talking
with
too
much
vivacity
and
you
are
throwing
your
arms
out
from
under
the
clothes
and
that
makes
you
cough
in
fact
fits
of
coughing
interrupted
fantine
at
nearly
every
word
fantine
did
not
murmur
she
feared
that
she
had
injured
by
her
too
passionate
lamentations
the
confidence
which
she
was
desirous
of
inspiring
and
she
began
to
talk
of
indifferent
things
montfermeil
is
quite
pretty
is
it
not
people
go
there
on
pleasure
parties
in
summer
are
the
thenardiers
prosperous
there
are
not
many
travellers
in
their
parts
that
inn
of
theirs
is
a
sort
of
a
cook
shop
m
madeleine
was
still
holding
her
hand
and
gazing
at
her
with
anxiety
it
was
evident
that
he
had
come
to
tell
her
things
before
which
his
mind
now
hesitated
the
doctor
having
finished
his
visit
retired
sister
simplice
remained
alone
with
them
but
in
the
midst
of
this
pause
fantine
exclaimed
i
hear
her
mon
dieu
i
hear
her
she
stretched
out
her
arm
to
enjoin
silence
about
her
held
her
breath
and
began
to
listen
with
rapture
there
was
a
child
playing
in
the
yard
the
child
of
the
portress
or
of
some
work
woman
it
was
one
of
those
accidents
which
are
always
occurring
and
which
seem
to
form
a
part
of
the
mysterious
stage
setting
of
mournful
scenes
the
child
a
little
girl
was
going
and
coming
running
to
warm
herself
laughing
singing
at
the
top
of
her
voice
alas
in
what
are
the
plays
of
children
not
intermingled
it
was
this
little
girl
whom
fantine
heard
singing
oh
she
resumed
it
is
my
cosette
i
recognize
her
voice
the
child
retreated
as
it
had
come
the
voice
died
away
fantine
listened
for
a
while
longer
then
her
face
clouded
over
and
m
madeleine
heard
her
say
in
a
low
voice
how
wicked
that
doctor
is
not
to
allow
me
to
see
my
daughter
that
man
has
an
evil
countenance
that
he
has
but
the
smiling
background
of
her
thoughts
came
to
the
front
again
she
continued
to
talk
to
herself
with
her
head
resting
on
the
pillow
how
happy
we
are
going
to
be
we
shall
have
a
little
garden
the
very
first
thing
m
madeleine
has
promised
it
to
me
my
daughter
will
play
in
the
garden
she
must
know
her
letters
by
this
time
i
will
make
her
spell
she
will
run
over
the
grass
after
butterflies
i
will
watch
her
then
she
will
take
her
first
communion
ah
when
will
she
take
her
first
communion
she
began
to
reckon
on
her
fingers
one
two
three
four
she
is
seven
years
old
in
five
years
she
will
have
a
white
veil
and
openwork
stockings
she
will
look
like
a
little
woman
o
my
good
sister
you
do
not
know
how
foolish
i
become
when
i
think
of
my
daughter
s
first
communion
she
began
to
laugh
he
had
released
fantine
s
hand
he
listened
to
her
words
as
one
listens
to
the
sighing
of
the
breeze
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
his
mind
absorbed
in
reflection
which
had
no
bottom
all
at
once
she
ceased
speaking
and
this
caused
him
to
raise
his
head
mechanically
fantine
had
become
terrible
she
no
longer
spoke
she
no
longer
breathed
she
had
raised
herself
to
a
sitting
posture
her
thin
shoulder
emerged
from
her
chemise
her
face
which
had
been
radiant
but
a
moment
before
was
ghastly
and
she
seemed
to
have
fixed
her
eyes
rendered
large
with
terror
on
something
alarming
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
room
good
god
he
exclaimed
what
ails
you
fantine
she
made
no
reply
she
did
not
remove
her
eyes
from
the
object
which
she
seemed
to
see
she
removed
one
hand
from
his
arm
and
with
the
other
made
him
a
sign
to
look
behind
him
he
turned
and
beheld
javert
chapter
iii
javert
satisfied
this
is
what
had
taken
place
the
half
hour
after
midnight
had
just
struck
when
m
madeleine
quitted
the
hall
of
assizes
in
arras
he
regained
his
inn
just
in
time
to
set
out
again
by
the
mail
wagon
in
which
he
had
engaged
his
place
a
little
before
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
had
arrived
at
m
sur
m
and
his
first
care
had
been
to
post
a
letter
to
m
laffitte
then
to
enter
the
infirmary
and
see
fantine
however
he
had
hardly
quitted
the
audience
hall
of
the
court
of
assizes
when
the
district
attorney
recovering
from
his
first
shock
had
taken
the
word
to
deplore
the
mad
deed
of
the
honorable
mayor
of
m
sur
m
to
declare
that
his
convictions
had
not
been
in
the
least
modified
by
that
curious
incident
which
would
be
explained
thereafter
and
to
demand
in
the
meantime
the
condemnation
of
that
champmathieu
who
was
evidently
the
real
jean
valjean
the
district
attorney
s
persistence
was
visibly
at
variance
with
the
sentiments
of
every
one
of
the
public
of
the
court
and
of
the
jury
the
counsel
for
the
defence
had
some
difficulty
in
refuting
this
harangue
and
in
establishing
that
in
consequence
of
the
revelations
of
m
madeleine
that
is
to
say
of
the
real
jean
valjean
the
aspect
of
the
matter
had
been
thoroughly
altered
and
that
the
jury
had
before
their
eyes
now
only
an
innocent
man
thence
the
lawyer
had
drawn
some
epiphonemas
not
very
fresh
unfortunately
upon
judicial
errors
etc
etc
the
president
in
his
summing
up
had
joined
the
counsel
for
the
defence
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
jury
had
thrown
champmathieu
out
of
the
case
nevertheless
the
district
attorney
was
bent
on
having
a
jean
valjean
and
as
he
had
no
longer
champmathieu
he
took
madeleine
immediately
after
champmathieu
had
been
set
at
liberty
the
district
attorney
shut
himself
up
with
the
president
they
conferred
as
to
the
necessity
of
seizing
the
person
of
m
le
maire
of
m
sur
m
this
phrase
in
which
there
was
a
great
deal
of
of
is
the
district
attorney
s
written
with
his
own
hand
on
the
minutes
of
his
report
to
the
attorney
general
his
first
emotion
having
passed
off
the
president
did
not
offer
many
objections
justice
must
after
all
take
its
course
and
then
when
all
was
said
although
the
president
was
a
kindly
and
a
tolerably
intelligent
man
he
was
at
the
same
time
a
devoted
and
almost
an
ardent
royalist
and
he
had
been
shocked
to
hear
the
mayor
of
m
sur
m
say
the
emperor
and
not
bonaparte
when
alluding
to
the
landing
at
cannes
the
order
for
his
arrest
was
accordingly
despatched
the
district
attorney
forwarded
it
to
m
sur
m
by
a
special
messenger
at
full
speed
and
entrusted
its
execution
to
police
inspector
javert
the
reader
knows
that
javert
had
returned
to
m
sur
m
immediately
after
having
given
his
deposition
javert
was
just
getting
out
of
bed
when
the
messenger
handed
him
the
order
of
arrest
and
the
command
to
produce
the
prisoner
the
messenger
himself
was
a
very
clever
member
of
the
police
who
in
two
words
informed
javert
of
what
had
taken
place
at
arras
the
order
of
arrest
signed
by
the
district
attorney
was
couched
in
these
words
inspector
javert
will
apprehend
the
body
of
the
sieur
madeleine
mayor
of
m
sur
m
who
in
this
day
s
session
of
the
court
was
recognized
as
the
liberated
convict
jean
valjean
any
one
who
did
not
know
javert
and
who
had
chanced
to
see
him
at
the
moment
when
he
penetrated
the
antechamber
of
the
infirmary
could
have
divined
nothing
of
what
had
taken
place
and
would
have
thought
his
air
the
most
ordinary
in
the
world
he
was
cool
calm
grave
his
gray
hair
was
perfectly
smooth
upon
his
temples
and
he
had
just
mounted
the
stairs
with
his
habitual
deliberation
any
one
who
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
him
and
who
had
examined
him
attentively
at
the
moment
would
have
shuddered
the
buckle
of
his
leather
stock
was
under
his
left
ear
instead
of
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
this
betrayed
unwonted
agitation
javert
was
a
complete
character
who
never
had
a
wrinkle
in
his
duty
or
in
his
uniform
methodical
with
malefactors
rigid
with
the
buttons
of
his
coat
that
he
should
have
set
the
buckle
of
his
stock
awry
it
was
indispensable
that
there
should
have
taken
place
in
him
one
of
those
emotions
which
may
be
designated
as
internal
earthquakes
he
had
come
in
a
simple
way
had
made
a
requisition
on
the
neighboring
post
for
a
corporal
and
four
soldiers
had
left
the
soldiers
in
the
courtyard
had
had
fantine
s
room
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
portress
who
was
utterly
unsuspicious
accustomed
as
she
was
to
seeing
armed
men
inquiring
for
the
mayor
on
arriving
at
fantine
s
chamber
javert
turned
the
handle
pushed
the
door
open
with
the
gentleness
of
a
sick
nurse
or
a
police
spy
and
entered
properly
speaking
he
did
not
enter
he
stood
erect
in
the
half
open
door
his
hat
on
his
head
and
his
left
hand
thrust
into
his
coat
which
was
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
in
the
bend
of
his
elbow
the
leaden
head
of
his
enormous
cane
which
was
hidden
behind
him
could
be
seen
thus
he
remained
for
nearly
a
minute
without
his
presence
being
perceived
all
at
once
fantine
raised
her
eyes
saw
him
and
made
m
madeleine
turn
round
the
instant
that
madeleine
s
glance
encountered
javert
s
glance
javert
without
stirring
without
moving
from
his
post
without
approaching
him
became
terrible
no
human
sentiment
can
be
as
terrible
as
joy
it
was
the
visage
of
a
demon
who
has
just
found
his
damned
soul
the
satisfaction
of
at
last
getting
hold
of
jean
valjean
caused
all
that
was
in
his
soul
to
appear
in
his
countenance
the
depths
having
been
stirred
up
mounted
to
the
surface
the
humiliation
of
having
in
some
slight
degree
lost
the
scent
and
of
having
indulged
for
a
few
moments
in
an
error
with
regard
to
champmathieu
was
effaced
by
pride
at
having
so
well
and
accurately
divined
in
the
first
place
and
of
having
for
so
long
cherished
a
just
instinct
javert
s
content
shone
forth
in
his
sovereign
attitude
the
deformity
of
triumph
overspread
that
narrow
brow
all
the
demonstrations
of
horror
which
a
satisfied
face
can
afford
were
there
javert
was
in
heaven
at
that
moment
without
putting
the
thing
clearly
to
himself
but
with
a
confused
intuition
of
the
necessity
of
his
presence
and
of
his
success
he
javert
personified
justice
light
and
truth
in
their
celestial
function
of
crushing
out
evil
behind
him
and
around
him
at
an
infinite
distance
he
had
authority
reason
the
case
judged
the
legal
conscience
the
public
prosecution
all
the
stars
he
was
protecting
order
he
was
causing
the
law
to
yield
up
its
thunders
he
was
avenging
society
he
was
lending
a
helping
hand
to
the
absolute
he
was
standing
erect
in
the
midst
of
a
glory
there
existed
in
his
victory
a
remnant
of
defiance
and
of
combat
erect
haughty
brilliant
he
flaunted
abroad
in
open
day
the
superhuman
bestiality
of
a
ferocious
archangel
the
terrible
shadow
of
the
action
which
he
was
accomplishing
caused
the
vague
flash
of
the
social
sword
to
be
visible
in
his
clenched
fist
happy
and
indignant
he
held
his
heel
upon
crime
vice
rebellion
perdition
hell
he
was
radiant
he
exterminated
he
smiled
and
there
was
an
incontestable
grandeur
in
this
monstrous
saint
michael
javert
though
frightful
had
nothing
ignoble
about
him
probity
sincerity
candor
conviction
the
sense
of
duty
are
things
which
may
become
hideous
when
wrongly
directed
but
which
even
when
hideous
remain
grand
their
majesty
the
majesty
peculiar
to
the
human
conscience
clings
to
them
in
the
midst
of
horror
they
are
virtues
which
have
one
vice
error
the
honest
pitiless
joy
of
a
fanatic
in
the
full
flood
of
his
atrocity
preserves
a
certain
lugubriously
venerable
radiance
without
himself
suspecting
the
fact
javert
in
his
formidable
happiness
was
to
be
pitied
as
is
every
ignorant
man
who
triumphs
nothing
could
be
so
poignant
and
so
terrible
as
this
face
wherein
was
displayed
all
that
may
be
designated
as
the
evil
of
the
good
chapter
iv
authority
reasserts
its
rights
fantine
had
not
seen
javert
since
the
day
on
which
the
mayor
had
torn
her
from
the
man
her
ailing
brain
comprehended
nothing
but
the
only
thing
which
she
did
not
doubt
was
that
he
had
come
to
get
her
she
could
not
endure
that
terrible
face
she
felt
her
life
quitting
her
she
hid
her
face
in
both
hands
and
shrieked
in
her
anguish
monsieur
madeleine
save
me
jean
valjean
we
shall
henceforth
not
speak
of
him
otherwise
had
risen
he
said
to
fantine
in
the
gentlest
and
calmest
of
voices
be
at
ease
it
is
not
for
you
that
he
is
come
then
he
addressed
javert
and
said
i
know
what
you
want
javert
replied
be
quick
about
it
there
lay
in
the
inflection
of
voice
which
accompanied
these
words
something
indescribably
fierce
and
frenzied
javert
did
not
say
be
quick
about
it
he
said
bequiabouit
no
orthography
can
do
justice
to
the
accent
with
which
it
was
uttered
it
was
no
longer
a
human
word
it
was
a
roar
he
did
not
proceed
according
to
his
custom
he
did
not
enter
into
the
matter
he
exhibited
no
warrant
of
arrest
in
his
eyes
jean
valjean
was
a
sort
of
mysterious
combatant
who
was
not
to
be
laid
hands
upon
a
wrestler
in
the
dark
whom
he
had
had
in
his
grasp
for
the
last
five
years
without
being
able
to
throw
him
this
arrest
was
not
a
beginning
but
an
end
he
confined
himself
to
saying
be
quick
about
it
as
he
spoke
thus
he
did
not
advance
a
single
step
he
hurled
at
jean
valjean
a
glance
which
he
threw
out
like
a
grappling
hook
and
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
draw
wretches
violently
to
him
it
was
this
glance
which
fantine
had
felt
penetrating
to
the
very
marrow
of
her
bones
two
months
previously
at
javert
s
exclamation
fantine
opened
her
eyes
once
more
but
the
mayor
was
there
what
had
she
to
fear
javert
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
cried
see
here
now
art
thou
coming
the
unhappy
woman
glanced
about
her
no
one
was
present
excepting
the
nun
and
the
mayor
to
whom
could
that
abject
use
of
thou
be
addressed
to
her
only
she
shuddered
then
she
beheld
a
most
unprecedented
thing
a
thing
so
unprecedented
that
nothing
equal
to
it
had
appeared
to
her
even
in
the
blackest
deliriums
of
fever
she
beheld
javert
the
police
spy
seize
the
mayor
by
the
collar
she
saw
the
mayor
bow
his
head
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
javert
had
in
fact
grasped
jean
valjean
by
the
collar
monsieur
le
maire
shrieked
fantine
javert
burst
out
laughing
with
that
frightful
laugh
which
displayed
all
his
gums
there
is
no
longer
any
monsieur
le
maire
here
jean
valjean
made
no
attempt
to
disengage
the
hand
which
grasped
the
collar
of
his
coat
he
said
javert
javert
interrupted
him
call
me
mr
inspector
monsieur
said
jean
valjean
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
to
you
in
private
aloud
say
it
aloud
replied
javert
people
are
in
the
habit
of
talking
aloud
to
me
jean
valjean
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
i
tell
you
to
speak
loud
but
you
alone
should
hear
it
what
difference
does
that
make
to
me
i
shall
not
listen
jean
valjean
turned
towards
him
and
said
very
rapidly
and
in
a
very
low
voice
grant
me
three
days
grace
three
days
in
which
to
go
and
fetch
the
child
of
this
unhappy
woman
i
will
pay
whatever
is
necessary
you
shall
accompany
me
if
you
choose
you
are
making
sport
of
me
cried
javert
come
now
i
did
not
think
you
such
a
fool
you
ask
me
to
give
you
three
days
in
which
to
run
away
you
say
that
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
fetching
that
creature
s
child
ah
ah
that
s
good
that
s
really
capital
fantine
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
trembling
my
child
she
cried
to
go
and
fetch
my
child
she
is
not
here
then
answer
me
sister
where
is
cosette
i
want
my
child
monsieur
madeleine
monsieur
le
maire
javert
stamped
his
foot
and
now
there
s
the
other
one
will
you
hold
your
tongue
you
hussy
it
s
a
pretty
sort
of
a
place
where
convicts
are
magistrates
and
where
women
of
the
town
are
cared
for
like
countesses
ah
but
we
are
going
to
change
all
that
it
is
high
time
he
stared
intently
at
fantine
and
added
once
more
taking
into
his
grasp
jean
valjean
s
cravat
shirt
and
collar
i
tell
you
that
there
is
no
monsieur
madeleine
and
that
there
is
no
monsieur
le
maire
there
is
a
thief
a
brigand
a
convict
named
jean
valjean
and
i
have
him
in
my
grasp
that
s
what
there
is
fantine
raised
herself
in
bed
with
a
bound
supporting
herself
on
her
stiffened
arms
and
on
both
hands
she
gazed
at
jean
valjean
she
gazed
at
javert
she
gazed
at
the
nun
she
opened
her
mouth
as
though
to
speak
a
rattle
proceeded
from
the
depths
of
her
throat
her
teeth
chattered
she
stretched
out
her
arms
in
her
agony
opening
her
hands
convulsively
and
fumbling
about
her
like
a
drowning
person
then
suddenly
fell
back
on
her
pillow
her
head
struck
the
head
board
of
the
bed
and
fell
forwards
on
her
breast
with
gaping
mouth
and
staring
sightless
eyes
she
was
dead
jean
valjean
laid
his
hand
upon
the
detaining
hand
of
javert
and
opened
it
as
he
would
have
opened
the
hand
of
a
baby
then
he
said
to
javert
you
have
murdered
that
woman
let
s
have
an
end
of
this
shouted
javert
in
a
fury
i
am
not
here
to
listen
to
argument
let
us
economize
all
that
the
guard
is
below
march
on
instantly
or
you
ll
get
the
thumb
screws
in
the
corner
of
the
room
stood
an
old
iron
bedstead
which
was
in
a
decidedly
decrepit
state
and
which
served
the
sisters
as
a
camp
bed
when
they
were
watching
with
the
sick
jean
valjean
stepped
up
to
this
bed
in
a
twinkling
wrenched
off
the
head
piece
which
was
already
in
a
dilapidated
condition
an
easy
matter
to
muscles
like
his
grasped
the
principal
rod
like
a
bludgeon
and
glanced
at
javert
javert
retreated
towards
the
door
jean
valjean
armed
with
his
bar
of
iron
walked
slowly
up
to
fantine
s
couch
when
he
arrived
there
he
turned
and
said
to
javert
in
a
voice
that
was
barely
audible
i
advise
you
not
to
disturb
me
at
this
moment
one
thing
is
certain
and
that
is
that
javert
trembled
it
did
occur
to
him
to
summon
the
guard
but
jean
valjean
might
avail
himself
of
that
moment
to
effect
his
escape
so
he
remained
grasped
his
cane
by
the
small
end
and
leaned
against
the
door
post
without
removing
his
eyes
from
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
rested
his
elbow
on
the
knob
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
his
brow
on
his
hand
and
began
to
contemplate
the
motionless
body
of
fantine
which
lay
extended
there
he
remained
thus
mute
absorbed
evidently
with
no
further
thought
of
anything
connected
with
this
life
upon
his
face
and
in
his
attitude
there
was
nothing
but
inexpressible
pity
after
a
few
moments
of
this
meditation
he
bent
towards
fantine
and
spoke
to
her
in
a
low
voice
what
did
he
say
to
her
what
could
this
man
who
was
reproved
say
to
that
woman
who
was
dead
what
words
were
those
no
one
on
earth
heard
them
did
the
dead
woman
hear
them
there
are
some
touching
illusions
which
are
perhaps
sublime
realities
the
point
as
to
which
there
exists
no
doubt
is
that
sister
simplice
the
sole
witness
of
the
incident
often
said
that
at
the
moment
that
jean
valjean
whispered
in
fantine
s
ear
she
distinctly
beheld
an
ineffable
smile
dawn
on
those
pale
lips
and
in
those
dim
eyes
filled
with
the
amazement
of
the
tomb
jean
valjean
took
fantine
s
head
in
both
his
hands
and
arranged
it
on
the
pillow
as
a
mother
might
have
done
for
her
child
then
he
tied
the
string
of
her
chemise
and
smoothed
her
hair
back
under
her
cap
that
done
he
closed
her
eyes
fantine
s
face
seemed
strangely
illuminated
at
that
moment
death
that
signifies
entrance
into
the
great
light
fantine
s
hand
was
hanging
over
the
side
of
the
bed
jean
valjean
knelt
down
before
that
hand
lifted
it
gently
and
kissed
it
then
he
rose
and
turned
to
javert
now
said
he
i
am
at
your
disposal
chapter
v
a
suitable
tomb
javert
deposited
jean
valjean
in
the
city
prison
the
arrest
of
m
madeleine
occasioned
a
sensation
or
rather
an
extraordinary
commotion
in
m
sur
m
we
are
sorry
that
we
cannot
conceal
the
fact
that
at
the
single
word
he
was
a
convict
nearly
every
one
deserted
him
in
less
than
two
hours
all
the
good
that
he
had
done
had
been
forgotten
and
he
was
nothing
but
a
convict
from
the
galleys
it
is
just
to
add
that
the
details
of
what
had
taken
place
at
arras
were
not
yet
known
all
day
long
conversations
like
the
following
were
to
be
heard
in
all
quarters
of
the
town
you
don
t
know
he
was
a
liberated
convict
who
the
mayor
bah
m
madeleine
yes
really
his
name
was
not
madeleine
at
all
he
had
a
frightful
name
bejean
bojean
boujean
ah
good
god
he
has
been
arrested
arrested
in
prison
in
the
city
prison
while
waiting
to
be
transferred
until
he
is
transferred
he
is
to
be
transferred
where
is
he
to
be
taken
he
will
be
tried
at
the
assizes
for
a
highway
robbery
which
he
committed
long
ago
well
i
suspected
as
much
that
man
was
too
good
too
perfect
too
affected
he
refused
the
cross
he
bestowed
sous
on
all
the
little
scamps
he
came
across
i
always
thought
there
was
some
evil
history
back
of
all
that
the
drawing
rooms
particularly
abounded
in
remarks
of
this
nature
one
old
lady
a
subscriber
to
the
drapeau
blanc
made
the
following
remark
the
depth
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
fathom
i
am
not
sorry
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
the
bonapartists
it
was
thus
that
the
phantom
which
had
been
called
m
madeleine
vanished
from
m
sur
m
only
three
or
four
persons
in
all
the
town
remained
faithful
to
his
memory
the
old
portress
who
had
served
him
was
among
the
number
on
the
evening
of
that
day
the
worthy
old
woman
was
sitting
in
her
lodge
still
in
a
thorough
fright
and
absorbed
in
sad
reflections
the
factory
had
been
closed
all
day
the
carriage
gate
was
bolted
the
street
was
deserted
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
but
the
two
nuns
sister
perpetue
and
sister
simplice
who
were
watching
beside
the
body
of
fantine
towards
the
hour
when
m
madeleine
was
accustomed
to
return
home
the
good
portress
rose
mechanically
took
from
a
drawer
the
key
of
m
madeleine
s
chamber
and
the
flat
candlestick
which
he
used
every
evening
to
go
up
to
his
quarters
then
she
hung
the
key
on
the
nail
whence
he
was
accustomed
to
take
it
and
set
the
candlestick
on
one
side
as
though
she
was
expecting
him
then
she
sat
down
again
on
her
chair
and
became
absorbed
in
thought
once
more
the
poor
good
old
woman
had
done
all
this
without
being
conscious
of
it
it
was
only
at
the
expiration
of
two
hours
that
she
roused
herself
from
her
revery
and
exclaimed
hold
my
good
god
jesus
and
i
hung
his
key
on
the
nail
at
that
moment
the
small
window
in
the
lodge
opened
a
hand
passed
through
seized
the
key
and
the
candlestick
and
lighted
the
taper
at
the
candle
which
was
burning
there
the
portress
raised
her
eyes
and
stood
there
with
gaping
mouth
and
a
shriek
which
she
confined
to
her
throat
she
knew
that
hand
that
arm
the
sleeve
of
that
coat
it
was
m
madeleine
it
was
several
seconds
before
she
could
speak
she
had
a
seizure
as
she
said
herself
when
she
related
the
adventure
afterwards
good
god
monsieur
le
maire
she
cried
at
last
i
thought
you
were
she
stopped
the
conclusion
of
her
sentence
would
have
been
lacking
in
respect
towards
the
beginning
jean
valjean
was
still
monsieur
le
maire
to
her
he
finished
her
thought
in
prison
said
he
i
was
there
i
broke
a
bar
of
one
of
the
windows
i
let
myself
drop
from
the
top
of
a
roof
and
here
i
am
i
am
going
up
to
my
room
go
and
find
sister
simplice
for
me
she
is
with
that
poor
woman
no
doubt
the
old
woman
obeyed
in
all
haste
he
gave
her
no
orders
he
was
quite
sure
that
she
would
guard
him
better
than
he
should
guard
himself
no
one
ever
found
out
how
he
had
managed
to
get
into
the
courtyard
without
opening
the
big
gates
he
had
and
always
carried
about
him
a
pass
key
which
opened
a
little
side
door
but
he
must
have
been
searched
and
his
latch
key
must
have
been
taken
from
him
this
point
was
never
explained
he
ascended
the
staircase
leading
to
his
chamber
on
arriving
at
the
top
he
left
his
candle
on
the
top
step
of
his
stairs
opened
his
door
with
very
little
noise
went
and
closed
his
window
and
his
shutters
by
feeling
then
returned
for
his
candle
and
re
entered
his
room
it
was
a
useful
precaution
it
will
be
recollected
that
his
window
could
be
seen
from
the
street
he
cast
a
glance
about
him
at
his
table
at
his
chair
at
his
bed
which
had
not
been
disturbed
for
three
days
no
trace
of
the
disorder
of
the
night
before
last
remained
the
portress
had
done
up
his
room
only
she
had
picked
out
of
the
ashes
and
placed
neatly
on
the
table
the
two
iron
ends
of
the
cudgel
and
the
forty
sou
piece
which
had
been
blackened
by
the
fire
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
wrote
these
are
the
two
tips
of
my
iron
shod
cudgel
and
the
forty
sou
piece
stolen
from
little
gervais
which
i
mentioned
at
the
court
of
assizes
and
he
arranged
this
piece
of
paper
the
bits
of
iron
and
the
coin
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
the
first
things
to
be
seen
on
entering
the
room
from
a
cupboard
he
pulled
out
one
of
his
old
shirts
which
he
tore
in
pieces
in
the
strips
of
linen
thus
prepared
he
wrapped
the
two
silver
candlesticks
he
betrayed
neither
haste
nor
agitation
and
while
he
was
wrapping
up
the
bishop
s
candlesticks
he
nibbled
at
a
piece
of
black
bread
it
was
probably
the
prison
bread
which
he
had
carried
with
him
in
his
flight
this
was
proved
by
the
crumbs
which
were
found
on
the
floor
of
the
room
when
the
authorities
made
an
examination
later
on
there
came
two
taps
at
the
door
come
in
said
he
it
was
sister
simplice
she
was
pale
her
eyes
were
red
the
candle
which
she
carried
trembled
in
her
hand
the
peculiar
feature
of
the
violences
of
destiny
is
that
however
polished
or
cool
we
may
be
they
wring
human
nature
from
our
very
bowels
and
force
it
to
reappear
on
the
surface
the
emotions
of
that
day
had
turned
the
nun
into
a
woman
once
more
she
had
wept
and
she
was
trembling
jean
valjean
had
just
finished
writing
a
few
lines
on
a
paper
which
he
handed
to
the
nun
saying
sister
you
will
give
this
to
monsieur
le
cure
the
paper
was
not
folded
she
cast
a
glance
upon
it
you
can
read
it
said
he
she
read
i
beg
monsieur
le
cure
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
that
i
leave
behind
me
he
will
be
so
good
as
to
pay
out
of
it
the
expenses
of
my
trial
and
of
the
funeral
of
the
woman
who
died
yesterday
the
rest
is
for
the
poor
the
sister
tried
to
speak
but
she
only
managed
to
stammer
a
few
inarticulate
sounds
she
succeeded
in
saying
however
does
not
monsieur
le
maire
desire
to
take
a
last
look
at
that
poor
unhappy
woman
no
said
he
i
am
pursued
it
would
only
end
in
their
arresting
me
in
that
room
and
that
would
disturb
her
he
had
hardly
finished
when
a
loud
noise
became
audible
on
the
staircase
they
heard
a
tumult
of
ascending
footsteps
and
the
old
portress
saying
in
her
loudest
and
most
piercing
tones
my
good
sir
i
swear
to
you
by
the
good
god
that
not
a
soul
has
entered
this
house
all
day
nor
all
the
evening
and
that
i
have
not
even
left
the
door
a
man
responded
but
there
is
a
light
in
that
room
nevertheless
they
recognized
javert
s
voice
the
chamber
was
so
arranged
that
the
door
in
opening
masked
the
corner
of
the
wall
on
the
right
jean
valjean
blew
out
the
light
and
placed
himself
in
this
angle
sister
simplice
fell
on
her
knees
near
the
table
the
door
opened
javert
entered
the
whispers
of
many
men
and
the
protestations
of
the
portress
were
audible
in
the
corridor
the
nun
did
not
raise
her
eyes
she
was
praying
the
candle
was
on
the
chimney
piece
and
gave
but
very
little
light
javert
caught
sight
of
the
nun
and
halted
in
amazement
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
fundamental
point
in
javert
his
element
the
very
air
he
breathed
was
veneration
for
all
authority
this
was
impregnable
and
admitted
of
neither
objection
nor
restriction
in
his
eyes
of
course
the
ecclesiastical
authority
was
the
chief
of
all
he
was
religious
superficial
and
correct
on
this
point
as
on
all
others
in
his
eyes
a
priest
was
a
mind
who
never
makes
a
mistake
a
nun
was
a
creature
who
never
sins
they
were
souls
walled
in
from
this
world
with
a
single
door
which
never
opened
except
to
allow
the
truth
to
pass
through
on
perceiving
the
sister
his
first
movement
was
to
retire
but
there
was
also
another
duty
which
bound
him
and
impelled
him
imperiously
in
the
opposite
direction
his
second
movement
was
to
remain
and
to
venture
on
at
least
one
question
this
was
sister
simplice
who
had
never
told
a
lie
in
her
life
javert
knew
it
and
held
her
in
special
veneration
in
consequence
sister
said
he
are
you
alone
in
this
room
a
terrible
moment
ensued
during
which
the
poor
portress
felt
as
though
she
should
faint
the
sister
raised
her
eyes
and
answered
yes
then
resumed
javert
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
persist
it
is
my
duty
you
have
not
seen
a
certain
person
a
man
this
evening
he
has
escaped
we
are
in
search
of
him
that
jean
valjean
you
have
not
seen
him
the
sister
replied
no
she
lied
she
had
lied
twice
in
succession
one
after
the
other
without
hesitation
promptly
as
a
person
does
when
sacrificing
herself
pardon
me
said
javert
and
he
retired
with
a
deep
bow
o
sainted
maid
you
left
this
world
many
years
ago
you
have
rejoined
your
sisters
the
virgins
and
your
brothers
the
angels
in
the
light
may
this
lie
be
counted
to
your
credit
in
paradise
the
sister
s
affirmation
was
for
javert
so
decisive
a
thing
that
he
did
not
even
observe
the
singularity
of
that
candle
which
had
but
just
been
extinguished
and
which
was
still
smoking
on
the
table
an
hour
later
a
man
marching
amid
trees
and
mists
was
rapidly
departing
from
m
sur
m
in
the
direction
of
paris
that
man
was
jean
valjean
it
has
been
established
by
the
testimony
of
two
or
three
carters
who
met
him
that
he
was
carrying
a
bundle
that
he
was
dressed
in
a
blouse
where
had
he
obtained
that
blouse
no
one
ever
found
out
but
an
aged
workman
had
died
in
the
infirmary
of
the
factory
a
few
days
before
leaving
behind
him
nothing
but
his
blouse
perhaps
that
was
the
one
one
last
word
about
fantine
we
all
have
a
mother
the
earth
fantine
was
given
back
to
that
mother
the
cure
thought
that
he
was
doing
right
and
perhaps
he
really
was
in
reserving
as
much
money
as
possible
from
what
jean
valjean
had
left
for
the
poor
who
was
concerned
after
all
a
convict
and
a
woman
of
the
town
that
is
why
he
had
a
very
simple
funeral
for
fantine
and
reduced
it
to
that
strictly
necessary
form
known
as
the
pauper
s
grave
so
fantine
was
buried
in
the
free
corner
of
the
cemetery
which
belongs
to
anybody
and
everybody
and
where
the
poor
are
lost
fortunately
god
knows
where
to
find
the
soul
again
fantine
was
laid
in
the
shade
among
the
first
bones
that
came
to
hand
she
was
subjected
to
the
promiscuousness
of
ashes
she
was
thrown
into
the
public
grave
her
grave
resembled
her
bed

what
is
met
with
on
the
way
from
nivelles
last
year
1861
on
a
beautiful
may
morning
a
traveller
the
person
who
is
telling
this
story
was
coming
from
nivelles
and
directing
his
course
towards
la
hulpe
he
was
on
foot
he
was
pursuing
a
broad
paved
road
which
undulated
between
two
rows
of
trees
over
the
hills
which
succeed
each
other
raise
the
road
and
let
it
fall
again
and
produce
something
in
the
nature
of
enormous
waves
he
had
passed
lillois
and
bois
seigneur
isaac
in
the
west
he
perceived
the
slate
roofed
tower
of
braine
l
alleud
which
has
the
form
of
a
reversed
vase
he
had
just
left
behind
a
wood
upon
an
eminence
and
at
the
angle
of
the
cross
road
by
the
side
of
a
sort
of
mouldy
gibbet
bearing
the
inscription
ancient
barrier
no

a
public
house
bearing
on
its
front
this
sign
at
the
four
winds
aux
quatre
vents
echabeau
private
cafe
a
quarter
of
a
league
further
on
he
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
valley
where
there
is
water
which
passes
beneath
an
arch
made
through
the
embankment
of
the
road
the
clump
of
sparsely
planted
but
very
green
trees
which
fills
the
valley
on
one
side
of
the
road
is
dispersed
over
the
meadows
on
the
other
and
disappears
gracefully
and
as
in
order
in
the
direction
of
braine
l
alleud
on
the
right
close
to
the
road
was
an
inn
with
a
four
wheeled
cart
at
the
door
a
large
bundle
of
hop
poles
a
plough
a
heap
of
dried
brushwood
near
a
flourishing
hedge
lime
smoking
in
a
square
hole
and
a
ladder
suspended
along
an
old
penthouse
with
straw
partitions
a
young
girl
was
weeding
in
a
field
where
a
huge
yellow
poster
probably
of
some
outside
spectacle
such
as
a
parish
festival
was
fluttering
in
the
wind
at
one
corner
of
the
inn
beside
a
pool
in
which
a
flotilla
of
ducks
was
navigating
a
badly
paved
path
plunged
into
the
bushes
the
wayfarer
struck
into
this
after
traversing
a
hundred
paces
skirting
a
wall
of
the
fifteenth
century
surmounted
by
a
pointed
gable
with
bricks
set
in
contrast
he
found
himself
before
a
large
door
of
arched
stone
with
a
rectilinear
impost
in
the
sombre
style
of
louis
xiv
flanked
by
two
flat
medallions
a
severe
facade
rose
above
this
door
a
wall
perpendicular
to
the
facade
almost
touched
the
door
and
flanked
it
with
an
abrupt
right
angle
in
the
meadow
before
the
door
lay
three
harrows
through
which
in
disorder
grew
all
the
flowers
of
may
the
door
was
closed
the
two
decrepit
leaves
which
barred
it
were
ornamented
with
an
old
rusty
knocker
the
sun
was
charming
the
branches
had
that
soft
shivering
of
may
which
seems
to
proceed
rather
from
the
nests
than
from
the
wind
a
brave
little
bird
probably
a
lover
was
carolling
in
a
distracted
manner
in
a
large
tree
the
wayfarer
bent
over
and
examined
a
rather
large
circular
excavation
resembling
the
hollow
of
a
sphere
in
the
stone
on
the
left
at
the
foot
of
the
pier
of
the
door
at
this
moment
the
leaves
of
the
door
parted
and
a
peasant
woman
emerged
she
saw
the
wayfarer
and
perceived
what
he
was
looking
at
it
was
a
french
cannon
ball
which
made
that
she
said
to
him
and
she
added
that
which
you
see
there
higher
up
in
the
door
near
a
nail
is
the
hole
of
a
big
iron
bullet
as
large
as
an
egg
the
bullet
did
not
pierce
the
wood
what
is
the
name
of
this
place
inquired
the
wayfarer
hougomont
said
the
peasant
woman
the
traveller
straightened
himself
up
he
walked
on
a
few
paces
and
went
off
to
look
over
the
tops
of
the
hedges
on
the
horizon
through
the
trees
he
perceived
a
sort
of
little
elevation
and
on
this
elevation
something
which
at
that
distance
resembled
a
lion

was

which
that
great
wood

encountered
at

under

it

of

the
traveller
pushed
open
the
door
elbowed
an
ancient
calash
under
the
porch
and
entered
the
courtyard
the
first
thing
which
struck
him
in
this
paddock
was
a
door
of
the
sixteenth
century
which
here
simulates
an
arcade

balls
were
exhausted
on
this
heroic
section
of
wall
bauduin
s
brigade
was
not
strong
enough
to
force
hougomont
on
the
north
and
the
brigade
of
soye
could
not
do
more
than
effect
the
beginning
of
a
breach
on
the
south
but
without
taking
it
the
farm
buildings
border
the
courtyard
on
the
south
a
bit
of
the
north
door
broken
by
the
french
hangs
suspended
to
the
wall
it
consists
of
four
planks
nailed
to
two
cross
beams
on
which
the
scars
of
the
attack
are
visible
the
northern
door
which
was
beaten
in
by
the
french
and
which
has
had
a
piece
applied
to
it
to
replace
the
panel
suspended
on
the
wall
stands
half
open
at
the
bottom
of
the
paddock
it
is
cut
squarely
in
the
wall
built
of
stone
below
of
brick
above
which
closes
in
the
courtyard
on
the
north
it
is
a
simple
door
for
carts
such
as
exist
in
all
farms
with
the
two
large
leaves
made
of
rustic
planks
beyond
lie
the
meadows
the
dispute
over
this
entrance
was
furious
for
a
long
time
all
sorts
of
imprints
of
bloody
hands
were
visible
on
the
door
posts
it
was
there
that
bauduin
was
killed
the
storm
of
the
combat
still
lingers
in
this
courtyard
its
horror
is
visible
there
the
confusion
of
the
fray
was
petrified
there
it
lives
and
it
dies
there
it
was
only
yesterday
the
walls
are
in
the
death
agony
the
stones
fall
the
breaches
cry
aloud
the
holes
are
wounds
the
drooping
quivering
trees
seem
to
be
making
an
effort
to
flee
this
courtyard
was
more
built
up
in
1815
than
it
is
to
day
buildings
which
have
since
been
pulled
down
then
formed
redans
and
angles
the
english
barricaded
themselves
there
the
french
made
their
way
in
but
could
not
stand
their
ground
beside
the
chapel
one
wing
of
the
chateau
the
only
ruin
now
remaining
of
the
manor
of
hougomont
rises
in
a
crumbling
state
disembowelled
one
might
say
the
chateau
served
for
a
dungeon
the
chapel
for
a
block
house
there
men
exterminated
each
other
the
french
fired
on
from
every
point
from
behind
the
walls
from
the
summits
of
the
garrets
from
the
depths
of
the
cellars
through
all
the
casements
through
all
the
air
holes
through
every
crack
in
the
stones
fetched
fagots
and
set
fire
to
walls
and
men
the
reply
to
the
grape
shot
was
a
conflagration
in
the
ruined
wing
through
windows
garnished
with
bars
of
iron
the
dismantled
chambers
of
the
main
building
of
brick
are
visible
the
english
guards
were
in
ambush
in
these
rooms
the
spiral
of
the
staircase
cracked
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
very
roof
appears
like
the
inside
of
a
broken
shell
the
staircase
has
two
stories
the
english
besieged
on
the
staircase
and
massed
on
its
upper
steps
had
cut
off
the
lower
steps
these
consisted
of
large
slabs
of
blue
stone
which
form
a
heap
among
the
nettles
half
a
score
of
steps
still
cling
to
the
wall
on
the
first
is
cut
the
figure
of
a
trident
these
inaccessible
steps
are
solid
in
their
niches
all
the
rest
resembles
a
jaw
which
has
been
denuded
of
its
teeth
there
are
two
old
trees
there
one
is
dead
the
other
is
wounded
at
its
base
and
is
clothed
with
verdure
in
april
since
1815
it
has
taken
to
growing
through
the
staircase
a
massacre
took
place
in
the
chapel
the
interior
which
has
recovered
its
calm
is
singular
the
mass
has
not
been
said
there
since
the
carnage
nevertheless
the
altar
has
been
left
there
an
altar
of
unpolished
wood
placed
against
a
background
of
roughhewn
stone
four
whitewashed
walls
a
door
opposite
the
altar
two
small
arched
windows
over
the
door
a
large
wooden
crucifix
below
the
crucifix
a
square
air
hole
stopped
up
with
a
bundle
of
hay
on
the
ground
in
one
corner
an
old
window
frame
with
the
glass
all
broken
to
pieces
such
is
the
chapel
near
the
altar
there
is
nailed
up
a
wooden
statue
of
saint
anne
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
head
of
the
infant
jesus
has
been
carried
off
by
a
large
ball
the
french
who
were
masters
of
the
chapel
for
a
moment
and
were
then
dislodged
set
fire
to
it
the
flames
filled
this
building
it
was
a
perfect
furnace
the
door
was
burned
the
floor
was
burned
the
wooden
christ
was
not
burned
the
fire
preyed
upon
his
feet
of
which
only
the
blackened
stumps
are
now
to
be
seen
then
it
stopped
a
miracle
according
to
the
assertion
of
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
the
infant
jesus
decapitated
was
less
fortunate
than
the
christ
the
walls
are
covered
with
inscriptions
near
the
feet
of
christ
this
name
is
to
be
read
henquinez
then
these
others
conde
de
rio
maior
marques
y
marquesa
de
almagro
habana
there
are
french
names
with
exclamation
points
a
sign
of
wrath
the
wall
was
freshly
whitewashed
in
1849
the
nations
insulted
each
other
there
it
was
at
the
door
of
this
chapel
that
the
corpse
was
picked
up
which
held
an
axe
in
its
hand
this
corpse
was
sub
lieutenant
legros
on
emerging
from
the
chapel
a
well
is
visible
on
the
left
there
are
two
in
this
courtyard
one
inquires
why
is
there
no
bucket
and
pulley
to
this
it
is
because
water
is
no
longer
drawn
there
why
is
water
not
drawn
there
because
it
is
full
of
skeletons
the
last
person
who
drew
water
from
the
well
was
named
guillaume
van
kylsom
he
was
a
peasant
who
lived
at
hougomont
and
was
gardener
there
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
his
family
fled
and
concealed
themselves
in
the
woods
the
forest
surrounding
the
abbey
of
villiers
sheltered
these
unfortunate
people
who
had
been
scattered
abroad
for
many
days
and
nights
there
are
at
this
day
certain
traces
recognizable
such
as
old
boles
of
burned
trees
which
mark
the
site
of
these
poor
bivouacs
trembling
in
the
depths
of
the
thickets
guillaume
van
kylsom
remained
at
hougomont
to
guard
the
chateau
and
concealed
himself
in
the
cellar
the
english
discovered
him
there
they
tore
him
from
his
hiding
place
and
the
combatants
forced
this
frightened
man
to
serve
them
by
administering
blows
with
the
flats
of
their
swords
they
were
thirsty
this
guillaume
brought
them
water
it
was
from
this
well
that
he
drew
it
many
drank
there
their
last
draught
this
well
where
drank
so
many
of
the
dead
was
destined
to
die
itself
after
the
engagement
they
were
in
haste
to
bury
the
dead
bodies
death
has
a
fashion
of
harassing
victory
and
she
causes
the
pest
to
follow
glory
the
typhus
is
a
concomitant
of
triumph
this
well
was
deep
and
it
was
turned
into
a
sepulchre
three
hundred
dead
bodies
were
cast
into
it
with
too
much
haste
perhaps
were
they
all
dead
legend
says
they
were
not
it
seems
that
on
the
night
succeeding
the
interment
feeble
voices
were
heard
calling
from
the
well
this
well
is
isolated
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
three
walls
part
stone
part
brick
and
simulating
a
small
square
tower
and
folded
like
the
leaves
of
a
screen
surround
it
on
all
sides
the
fourth
side
is
open
it
is
there
that
the
water
was
drawn
the
wall
at
the
bottom
has
a
sort
of
shapeless
loophole
possibly
the
hole
made
by
a
shell
this
little
tower
had
a
platform
of
which
only
the
beams
remain
the
iron
supports
of
the
well
on
the
right
form
a
cross
on
leaning
over
the
eye
is
lost
in
a
deep
cylinder
of
brick
which
is
filled
with
a
heaped
up
mass
of
shadows
the
base
of
the
walls
all
about
the
well
is
concealed
in
a
growth
of
nettles
this
well
has
not
in
front
of
it
that
large
blue
slab
which
forms
the
table
for
all
wells
in
belgium
the
slab
has
here
been
replaced
by
a
cross
beam
against
which
lean
five
or
six
shapeless
fragments
of
knotty
and
petrified
wood
which
resemble
huge
bones
there
is
no
longer
either
pail
chain
or
pulley
but
there
is
still
the
stone
basin
which
served
the
overflow
the
rain
water
collects
there
and
from
time
to
time
a
bird
of
the
neighboring
forests
comes
thither
to
drink
and
then
flies
away
one
house
in
this
ruin
the
farmhouse
is
still
inhabited
the
door
of
this
house
opens
on
the
courtyard
upon
this
door
beside
a
pretty
gothic
lock
plate
there
is
an
iron
handle
with
trefoils
placed
slanting
at
the
moment
when
the
hanoverian
lieutenant
wilda
grasped
this
handle
in
order
to
take
refuge
in
the
farm
a
french
sapper
hewed
off
his
hand
with
an
axe
the
family
who
occupy
the
house
had
for
their
grandfather
guillaume
van
kylsom
the
old
gardener
dead
long
since
a
woman
with
gray
hair
said
to
us
i
was
there
i
was
three
years
old
my
sister
who
was
older
was
terrified
and
wept
they
carried
us
off
to
the
woods
i
went
there
in
my
mother
s
arms
we
glued
our
ears
to
the
earth
to
hear
i
imitated
the
cannon
and
went
boum
boum
a
door
opening
from
the
courtyard
on
the
left
led
into
the
orchard
so
we
were
told
the
orchard
is
terrible
it
is
in
three
parts
one
might
almost
say
in
three
acts
the
first
part
is
a
garden
the
second
is
an
orchard
the
third
is
a
wood
these
three
parts
have
a
common
enclosure
on
the
side
of
the
entrance
the
buildings
of
the
chateau
and
the
farm
on
the
left
a
hedge
on
the
right
a
wall
and
at
the
end
a
wall
the
wall
on
the
right
is
of
brick
the
wall
at
the
bottom
is
of
stone
one
enters
the
garden
first
it
slopes
downwards
is
planted
with
gooseberry
bushes
choked
with
a
wild
growth
of
vegetation
and
terminated
by
a
monumental
terrace
of
cut
stone
with
balustrade
with
a
double
curve
it
was
a
seignorial
garden
in
the
first
french
style
which
preceded
le
notre
to
day
it
is
ruins
and
briars
the
pilasters
are
surmounted
by
globes
which
resemble
cannon
balls
of
stone
forty
three
balusters
can
still
be
counted
on
their
sockets
the
rest
lie
prostrate
in
the
grass
almost
all
bear
scratches
of
bullets
one
broken
baluster
is
placed
on
the
pediment
like
a
fractured
leg
it
was
in
this
garden
further
down
than
the
orchard
that
six
light
infantry
men
of
the
1st
having
made
their
way
thither
and
being
unable
to
escape
hunted
down
and
caught
like
bears
in
their
dens
accepted
the
combat
with
two
hanoverian
companies
one
of
which
was
armed
with
carbines
the
hanoverians
lined
this
balustrade
and
fired
from
above
the
infantry
men
replying
from
below
six
against
two
hundred
intrepid
and
with
no
shelter
save
the
currant
bushes
took
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
die
one
mounts
a
few
steps
and
passes
from
the
garden
into
the
orchard
properly
speaking
there
within
the
limits
of
those
few
square
fathoms
fifteen
hundred
men
fell
in
less
than
an
hour
the
wall
seems
ready
to
renew
the
combat
thirty
eight
loopholes
pierced
by
the
english
at
irregular
heights
are
there
still
in
front
of
the
sixth
are
placed
two
english
tombs
of
granite
there
are
loopholes
only
in
the
south
wall
as
the
principal
attack
came
from
that
quarter
the
wall
is
hidden
on
the
outside
by
a
tall
hedge
the
french
came
up
thinking
that
they
had
to
deal
only
with
a
hedge
crossed
it
and
found
the
wall
both
an
obstacle
and
an
ambuscade
with
the
english
guards
behind
it
the
thirty
eight
loopholes
firing
at
once
a
shower
of
grape
shot
and
balls
and
soye
s
brigade
was
broken
against
it
thus
waterloo
began
nevertheless
the
orchard
was
taken
as
they
had
no
ladders
the
french
scaled
it
with
their
nails
they
fought
hand
to
hand
amid
the
trees
all
this
grass
has
been
soaked
in
blood
a
battalion
of
nassau
seven
hundred
strong
was
overwhelmed
there
the
outside
of
the
wall
against
which
kellermann
s
two
batteries
were
trained
is
gnawed
by
grape
shot
this
orchard
is
sentient
like
others
in
the
month
of
may
it
has
its
buttercups
and
its
daisies
the
grass
is
tall
there
the
cart
horses
browse
there
cords
of
hair
on
which
linen
is
drying
traverse
the
spaces
between
the
trees
and
force
the
passer
by
to
bend
his
head
one
walks
over
this
uncultivated
land
and
one
s
foot
dives
into
mole
holes
in
the
middle
of
the
grass
one
observes
an
uprooted
tree
bole
which
lies
there
all
verdant
major
blackmann
leaned
against
it
to
die
beneath
a
great
tree
in
the
neighborhood
fell
the
german
general
duplat
descended
from
a
french
family
which
fled
on
the
revocation
of

leans
far
over

the
affair
of
waterloo
chapter
iii
the
eighteenth
of
june
1815
let
us
turn
back
that
is
one
of
the
story
teller
s
rights
and
put
ourselves
once
more
in
the
year
1815
and
even
a
little
earlier
than
the
epoch
when
the
action
narrated
in
the
first
part
of
this
book
took
place
if
it
had
not
rained
in
the
night
between
the
17th
and
the
18th
of
june
1815
the
fate
of
europe
would
have
been
different
a
few
drops
of
water
more
or
less
decided
the
downfall
of
napoleon
all
that
providence
required
in
order
to
make
waterloo
the
end
of
austerlitz
was
a
little
more
rain
and
a
cloud
traversing
the
sky
out
of
season
sufficed
to
make
a
world
crumble
the
battle
of
waterloo
could
not
be
begun
until
half
past
eleven
o
clock
and
that
gave
blucher
time
to
come
up
why
because
the
ground
was
wet
the
artillery
had
to
wait
until
it
became
a
little
firmer
before
they
could
manoeuvre
napoleon
was
an
artillery
officer
and
felt
the
effects
of
this
the
foundation
of
this
wonderful
captain
was
the
man
who
in
the
report
to
the
directory
on
aboukir
said
such
a
one
of
our
balls
killed
six
men
all
his
plans
of
battle
were
arranged
for
projectiles
the
key
to
his
victory
was
to
make
the
artillery
converge
on
one
point
he
treated
the
strategy
of
the
hostile
general
like
a
citadel
and
made
a
breach
in
it
he
overwhelmed
the
weak
point
with
grape
shot
he
joined
and
dissolved
battles
with
cannon
there
was
something
of
the
sharpshooter
in
his
genius
to
beat
in
squares
to
pulverize
regiments
to
break
lines
to
crush
and
disperse
masses
for
him
everything
lay
in
this
to
strike
strike
strike
incessantly
and
he
intrusted
this
task
to
the
cannon
ball
a
redoubtable
method
and
one
which
united
with
genius
rendered
this
gloomy
athlete
of
the
pugilism
of
war
invincible
for

of
fifteen
years
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
he
relied
all
the
more
on
his
artillery
because
he
had
numbers
on
his
side
wellington
had
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
nine
mouths
of
fire
napoleon
had
two
hundred
and
forty
suppose
the
soil
dry
and
the
artillery
capable
of
moving
the
action
would
have
begun
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
battle
would
have
been
won
and
ended
at
two
o
clock
three
hours
before
the
change
of
fortune
in
favor
of
the
prussians
what
amount
of
blame
attaches
to
napoleon
for
the
loss
of
this
battle
is
the
shipwreck
due
to
the
pilot
was
it
the
evident
physical
decline
of
napoleon
that
complicated
this
epoch
by
an
inward
diminution
of
force
had
the
twenty
years
of
war
worn
out
the
blade
as
it
had
worn
the
scabbard
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
did
the
veteran
make
himself
disastrously
felt
in
the
leader
in
a
word
was
this
genius
as
many
historians
of
note
have
thought
suffering
from
an
eclipse
did
he
go
into
a
frenzy
in
order
to
disguise
his
weakened
powers
from
himself
did
he
begin
to
waver
under
the
delusion
of
a
breath
of
adventure
had
he
become
a
grave
matter
in
a
general
unconscious
of
peril
is
there
an
age
in
this
class
of
material
great
men
who
may
be
called
the
giants
of
action
when
genius
grows
short
sighted
old
age
has
no
hold
on
the
geniuses
of
the
ideal
for
the
dantes
and
michael
angelos
to
grow
old
is
to
grow
in
greatness
is
it
to
grow
less
for
the
hannibals
and
the
bonapartes
had
napoleon
lost
the
direct
sense
of
victory
had
he
reached
the
point
where
he
could
no
longer
recognize
the
reef
could
no
longer
divine
the
snare
no
longer
discern
the
crumbling
brink
of
abysses
had
he
lost
his
power
of
scenting
out
catastrophes
he
who
had
in
former
days
known
all
the
roads
to
triumph
and
who
from
the
summit
of
his
chariot
of
lightning
pointed
them
out
with
a
sovereign
finger
had
he
now
reached
that
state
of
sinister
amazement
when
he
could
lead
his
tumultuous
legions
harnessed
to
it
to
the
precipice
was
he
seized
at
the
age
of
forty
six
with
a
supreme
madness
was
that
titanic
charioteer
of
destiny
no
longer
anything
more
than
an
immense
dare
devil
we
do
not
think
so
his
plan
of
battle
was
by
the
confession
of
all
a
masterpiece
to
go
straight
to
the
centre
of
the
allies
line
to
make
a
breach
in
the
enemy
to
cut
them
in
two
to
drive
the
british
half
back
on
hal
and
the
prussian
half
on
tongres
to
make
two
shattered
fragments
of
wellington
and
blucher
to
carry
mont
saint
jean
to
seize
brussels
to
hurl
the
german
into
the
rhine
and
the
englishman
into
the
sea
all
this
was
contained
in
that
battle
according
to
napoleon
afterwards
people
would
see
of
course
we
do
not
here
pretend
to
furnish
a
history
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
one
of
the
scenes
of
the
foundation
of
the
story
which
we
are
relating
is
connected
with
this
battle
but
this
history
is
not
our
subject
this
history
moreover
has
been
finished
and
finished
in
a
masterly
manner
from
one
point
of
view
by
napoleon
and
from
another
point
of
view
by
a
whole
pleiad
of
historians

as
for
us
we
leave
the
historians
at
loggerheads
we
are
but
a
distant
witness
a
passer
by
on
the
plain
a
seeker
bending
over
that
soil
all
made
of
human
flesh
taking
appearances
for
realities
perchance
we
have
no
right
to
oppose
in
the
name
of
science
a
collection
of
facts
which
contain
illusions
no
doubt
we
possess
neither
military
practice
nor
strategic
ability
which
authorize
a
system
in
our
opinion
a
chain
of
accidents
dominated
the
two
leaders
at
waterloo
and
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
destiny
that
mysterious
culprit
we
judge
like

those
persons
who
wish
to
gain
a
clear
idea
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
have
only
to
place
mentally
on
the
ground
a
capital
a
the
left
limb
of
the

is
the
road
to
nivelles
the
right
limb
is
the
road
to

the

of

the
hollow
road
to
ohain
from
braine

the
top
of

is
mont

where
wellington
is
the
lower
left
tip
is
hougomont
where
reille
is
stationed
with
jerome
bonaparte
the
right
tip
is
the
belle
alliance
where
napoleon
was
at
the
centre
of
this
chord
is
the
precise
point
where
the
final
word
of
the
battle
was
pronounced
it
was
there
that
the
lion
has
been
placed
the
involuntary
symbol
of
the
supreme
heroism
of
the
imperial
guard
the
triangle
included
in
the
top
of
the
a
between
the
two
limbs
and
the
tie
is
the
plateau
of
mont
saint
jean
the
dispute
over
this
plateau
constituted
the
whole
battle
the
wings
of
the
two
armies
extended
to
the
right
and

of
the
two
roads

behind

behind
the

is
the
forest
of
soignes
as
for
the
plain
itself
let
the
reader
picture
to
himself
a
vast
undulating
sweep
of
ground
each
rise
commands
the
next
rise
and
all
the
undulations
mount
towards
mont
saint
jean
and
there
end
in
the
forest
two
hostile
troops
on
a
field
of
battle
are
two
wrestlers
it
is
a
question
of
seizing
the
opponent
round
the
waist
the
one
seeks
to
trip
up
the
other
they
clutch
at
everything
a
bush
is
a
point
of
support
an
angle
of
the
wall
offers
them
a
rest
to
the
shoulder
for
the
lack
of
a
hovel
under
whose
cover
they
can
draw
up
a
regiment
yields
its
ground
an
unevenness
in
the
ground
a
chance
turn
in
the
landscape
a
cross
path
encountered
at
the
right
moment
a
grove
a
ravine
can
stay
the
heel
of
that
colossus
which
is
called
an
army
and
prevent
its
retreat
he
who
quits
the
field
is
beaten
hence
the
necessity
devolving
on
the
responsible
leader
of
examining
the
most
insignificant
clump
of
trees
and
of
studying
deeply
the
slightest
relief
in
the
ground
the
two
generals
had
attentively
studied
the
plain
of
mont
saint
jean
now
called
the
plain
of
waterloo
in
the
preceding
year
wellington
with
the
sagacity
of
foresight
had
examined
it
as
the
possible
seat
of
a
great
battle
upon
this
spot
and
for
this
duel
on
the
18th
of
june
wellington
had
the
good
post
napoleon
the
bad
post
the
english
army
was
stationed
above
the
french
army
below
it
is
almost
superfluous
here
to
sketch
the
appearance
of
napoleon
on
horseback
glass
in
hand
upon
the
heights
of
rossomme
at
daybreak
on
june
18
1815
all
the
world
has
seen
him
before
we
can
show
him
that
calm
profile
under
the
little
three
cornered
hat
of
the
school
of
brienne
that
green
uniform
the
white
revers
concealing
the
star
of
the
legion
of
honor
his
great
coat
hiding
his
epaulets
the
corner
of
red
ribbon
peeping
from
beneath
his
vest
his
leather
trousers
the
white
horse
with
the
saddle
cloth
of
purple
velvet
bearing
on
the
corners
crowned
n
s
and
eagles
hessian
boots
over
silk
stockings
silver
spurs
the
sword
of
marengo
that
whole
figure
of
the
last
of
the
caesars
is
present
to
all
imaginations
saluted
with
acclamations
by
some
severely
regarded
by
others
that
figure
stood
for
a
long
time
wholly
in
the
light
this
arose
from
a
certain
legendary
dimness
evolved
by
the
majority
of
heroes
and
which
always
veils
the
truth
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
but
to
day
history
and
daylight
have
arrived
that
light
called
history
is
pitiless
it
possesses
this
peculiar
and
divine
quality
that
pure
light
as
it
is
and
precisely
because
it
is
wholly
light
it
often
casts
a
shadow
in
places
where
people
had
hitherto
beheld
rays
from
the
same
man
it
constructs
two
different
phantoms
and
the
one
attacks
the
other
and
executes
justice
on
it
and
the
shadows
of
the
despot
contend
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
leader
hence
arises
a
truer
measure
in
the
definitive
judgments
of
nations
babylon

it
is
a

for
a

to
leave
behind

the
night
which
bears
his
form
chapter
v
the
quid
obscurum
of
battles
every
one
is
acquainted
with
the
first
phase
of
this
battle
a
beginning
which
was
troubled
uncertain
hesitating
menacing
to
both
armies
but
still
more
so
for
the
english
than
for
the
french
it
had
rained
all
night
the
earth
had
been
cut
up
by
the
downpour
the
water
had
accumulated
here
and
there
in
the
hollows
of
the
plain
as
if
in
casks
at
some
points
the
gear
of
the
artillery
carriages
was
buried
up
to
the
axles
the
circingles
of
the
horses
were
dripping
with
liquid
mud
if
the
wheat
and
rye
trampled
down
by
this
cohort
of
transports
on
the
march
had
not
filled
in
the
ruts
and
strewn
a
litter
beneath
the
wheels
all
movement
particularly
in
the
valleys
in
the
direction
of
papelotte
would
have
been
impossible
the
affair
began
late
napoleon
as
we
have
already
explained
was
in
the
habit
of
keeping
all
his
artillery
well
in
hand
like
a
pistol
aiming
it
now
at
one
point
now
at
another
of
the
battle
and
it
had
been
his
wish
to
wait
until
the
horse
batteries
could
move
and
gallop
freely
in
order
to
do
that
it
was
necessary
that
the
sun
should
come
out
and
dry
the
soil
but
the
sun
did
not
make
its
appearance
it
was
no
longer
the
rendezvous
of
austerlitz
when
the
first
cannon
was
fired
the
english
general
colville
looked
at
his
watch
and
noted
that
it
was
thirty
five
minutes
past
eleven
the
action
was
begun
furiously
with
more
fury
perhaps
than
the
emperor
would
have
wished
by
the
left
wing
of
the
french
resting
on
hougomont
at
the
same
time
napoleon
attacked
the
centre
by
hurling
quiot
s
brigade
on
la
haie
sainte
and
ney
pushed
forward
the
right
wing
of
the
french
against
the
left
wing
of
the
english
which
rested
on
papelotte
the
attack
on
hougomont
was
something
of
a
feint
the
plan
was
to
draw
wellington
thither
and
to
make
him
swerve
to
the
left
this
plan
would
have
succeeded
if
the
four
companies
of
the
english
guards
and
the
brave
belgians
of
perponcher
s
division
had
not
held
the
position
solidly
and
wellington
instead
of
massing
his
troops
there
could
confine
himself
to
despatching
thither
as
reinforcements
only
four
more
companies
of
guards
and
one
battalion
from
brunswick
the
attack
of
the
right
wing
of
the
french
on
papelotte
was
calculated
in
fact
to
overthrow
the
english
left
to
cut
off
the
road
to
brussels
to
bar
the
passage
against
possible
prussians
to
force
mont
saint
jean
to
turn
wellington
back
on
hougomont
thence
on
braine
l
alleud
thence
on
hal
nothing
easier
with
the
exception
of
a
few
incidents
this
attack
succeeded
papelotte
was
taken
la

was
carried
a
detail
to
be
noted
there
was
in
the
english
infantry
particularly
in
kempt

brigade
a
great
many
raw
recruits
these
young
soldiers
were
valiant
in
the
presence
of
our
redoubtable
infantry
their
inexperience
extricated
them
intrepidly
from
the
dilemma
they
performed
particularly
excellent
service
as
skirmishers
the
soldier
skirmisher
left
somewhat
to
himself
becomes
so
to
speak
his
own
general
these
recruits
displayed
some
of
the
french
ingenuity
and
fury
this
novice
of

infantry

let
us
add
that
there
is
a
certain
instant
when
the
battle
degenerates
into
a
combat
becomes
specialized
and
disperses
into
innumerable
detailed
feats
which
to
borrow
the
expression
of
napoleon
himself
belong
rather
to
the
biography
of
the
regiments
than
to
the
history
of
the
army
the
historian
has
in
this
case
the
evident
right
to
sum
up
the
whole
he
cannot
do
more
than
seize
the
principal
outlines
of
the
struggle
and
it
is
not
given
to
any
one
narrator
however
conscientious
he
may
be
to
fix
absolutely
the
form
of
that
horrible
cloud
which
is
called
a

this
which
is
true
of

encounters
is
particularly
applicable
to

the

it
occupied
the

of
mont
saint

having
behind
it
the
village
and
in

of
it
the
slope
which
was
tolerably
steep

it
rested
on

stout
stone
dwelling

at
that
time
belonged
to
the
domain
of

which
marks
the

so
robust
that
the

rebounded

this

incontestably
authorized

was
so
well
done
that

who
had
been
despatched
by
the
emperor
at
nine
o

in
the
morning
to
reconnoitre
the
enemy
s

had
discovered
nothing
of

had
returned
and
reported
to
napoleon
that
there
were
no
obstacles
except
the
two
barricades
which
barred
the
road
to
nivelles

to

it

a

and

by

an

without

to
many
a

on

in

in
company
with

in

satisfied
at
the
sight
of
the
long
line
of
the
english
camp
fires
illuminating
the
whole
horizon
from
frischemont
to
braine
l
alleud
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
fate
to
whom
he
had
assigned
a
day
on
the
field
of
waterloo
was
exact
to
the
appointment
he
stopped
his
horse
and
remained
for
some
time
motionless
gazing
at
the
lightning
and
listening
to
the
thunder
and
this
fatalist
was
heard
to
cast
into
the
darkness
this
mysterious
saying
we
are
in
accord
napoleon
was
mistaken
they
were
no
longer
in
accord
he
took
not
a
moment
for
sleep
every
instant
of
that
night
was
marked
by
a
joy
for
him
he
traversed
the
line
of
the
principal
outposts
halting
here
and
there
to
talk
to
the
sentinels
at
half
past
two
near
the
wood
of
hougomont
he
heard
the
tread
of
a
column
on
the
march
he
thought
at
the
moment
that
it
was
a
retreat
on
the
part
of
wellington
he
said
it
is
the
rear
guard
of
the
english
getting
under
way
for
the
purpose
of
decamping
i
will
take
prisoners
the
six
thousand
english
who
have
just
arrived
at
ostend
he
conversed
expansively
he
regained
the
animation
which
he
had
shown
at
his
landing
on
the
first
of
march
when
he
pointed
out
to
the
grand
marshal
the
enthusiastic
peasant
of
the
gulf
juan
and
cried
well
bertrand
here
is
a
reinforcement
already
on
the
night
of
the
17th
to
the
18th
of
june
he
rallied
wellington
that
little
englishman
needs
a
lesson
said
napoleon
the
rain
redoubled
in
violence
the
thunder
rolled
while
the
emperor
was
speaking
at
half
past
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
lost
one
illusion
officers
who
had
been
despatched
to
reconnoitre
announced
to
him
that
the
enemy
was
not
making
any
movement
nothing
was
stirring
not
a
bivouac
fire
had
been
extinguished
the
english
army
was
asleep
the
silence
on
earth
was
profound
the
only
noise
was
in
the
heavens
at
four
o
clock
a
peasant
was
brought
in
to
him
by
the
scouts
this
peasant
had
served
as
guide
to
a
brigade
of
english
cavalry
probably
vivian
s
brigade
which
was
on
its
way
to
take
up
a
position
in
the
village
of
ohain
at
the
extreme
left
at
five
o
clock
two
belgian
deserters
reported
to
him
that
they
had
just
quitted
their
regiment
and
that
the
english
army
was
ready
for
battle
so
much
the
better
exclaimed
napoleon
i
prefer
to
overthrow
them
rather
than
to
drive
them
back
in
the
morning
he
dismounted
in
the
mud
on
the
slope
which
forms
an
angle
with
the
plancenoit
road
had
a
kitchen
table
and
a
peasant
s
chair
brought
to
him
from
the
farm
of
rossomme
seated
himself
with
a
truss
of
straw
for
a
carpet
and
spread
out
on
the
table
the
chart
of
the
battle
field
saying
to
soult
as
he
did
so
a
pretty
checker
board
in
consequence
of
the
rains
during
the
night
the
transports
of
provisions
embedded
in
the
soft
roads
had
not
been
able
to
arrive
by
morning
the
soldiers
had
had
no
sleep
they
were
wet
and
fasting
this
did
not
prevent
napoleon
from
exclaiming
cheerfully
to
ney
we
have
ninety
chances
out
of
a
hundred
at
eight
o
clock
the
emperor
s
breakfast
was
brought
to
him
he
invited
many
generals
to
it
during
breakfast
it
was
said
that
wellington
had
been
to
a
ball
two
nights
before
in
brussels
at
the
duchess
of
richmond
s
and
soult
a
rough
man
of
war
with
a
face
of
an
archbishop
said
the
ball
takes
place
to
day
the
emperor
jested
with
ney
who
said
wellington
will
not
be
so
simple
as
to
wait
for
your
majesty
that
was
his
way
however
he
was
fond
of
jesting
says
fleury
de
chaboulon
a
merry
humor
was
at
the
foundation
of
his
character
says
gourgaud
he
abounded
in
pleasantries
which
were
more
peculiar
than
witty
says
benjamin
constant
these
gayeties
of
a
giant
are
worthy
of
insistence
it
was
he
who
called
his
grenadiers
his
grumblers
he
pinched
their
ears
he
pulled
their
mustaches
the
emperor
did
nothing
but
play
pranks
on
us
is
the
remark
of
one
of
them
during
the
mysterious
trip
from
the
island
of
elba
to
france
on
the
27th
of
february
on
the
open
sea
the
french
brig
of
war
le
zephyr
having
encountered
the
brig
l
inconstant
on
which
napoleon
was
concealed
and
having
asked
the
news
of
napoleon
from
l
inconstant
the
emperor
who
still
wore
in
his
hat
the
white
and
amaranthine
cockade
sown
with
bees
which
he
had
adopted
at
the
isle
of
elba
laughingly
seized
the
speaking
trumpet
and
answered
for
himself
the
emperor
is
well
a
man
who
laughs
like
that
is
on
familiar
terms
with
events
napoleon
indulged
in
many
fits
of
this
laughter
during
the
breakfast
at
waterloo
after
breakfast
he
meditated
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
two
generals
seated
themselves
on
the
truss
of
straw
pen
in
hand
and
their
paper
on
their
knees
and
the
emperor
dictated
to
them
the
order
of
battle
at
nine
o
clock
at
the
instant
when
the
french
army
ranged
in
echelons
and
set
in
motion
in
five
columns
had
deployed
the
divisions
in
two
lines
the
artillery
between
the
brigades
the
music
at
their
head
as
they
beat
the
march
with
rolls
on
the
drums
and
the
blasts
of
trumpets
mighty
vast
joyous
a
sea
of
casques
of
sabres
and
of
bayonets
on
the
horizon
the
emperor
was
touched
and
twice
exclaimed
magnificent
magnificent
between
nine
o
clock
and
half
past
ten
the
whole
army
incredible
as
it
may
appear
had
taken
up
its
position
and
ranged
itself
in
six
lines
forming
to
repeat
the
emperor
s
expression
the
figure
of
six
v
s
a
few
moments
after
the
formation
of
the
battle
array
in
the
midst
of
that
profound
silence
like
that
which
heralds
the
beginning
of
a
storm
which
precedes
engagements
the
emperor
tapped
haxo
on
the
shoulder
as
he
beheld
the
three
batteries
of
twelve
pounders
detached
by
his
orders
from
the
corps
of
erlon
reille
and
lobau
and
destined
to
begin
the
action
by
taking
mont
saint
jean
which
was
situated
at
the
intersection
of
the
nivelles
and
the
genappe
roads
and
said
to
him
there
are
four
and
twenty
handsome
maids
general
sure
of
the
issue
he
encouraged
with
a
smile
as
they
passed
before
him
the
company
of
sappers
of
the
first
corps
which
he
had
appointed
to
barricade
mont
saint
jean
as
soon
as
the
village
should
be
carried
all
this
serenity
had
been
traversed
by
but
a
single
word
of
haughty
pity
perceiving
on
his
left
at
a
spot
where
there
now
stands
a
large
tomb
those
admirable
scotch
grays
with
their
superb
horses
massing
themselves
he
said
it
is
a
pity
then
he
mounted
his
horse
advanced
beyond
rossomme
and
selected
for
his
post
of
observation
a
contracted
elevation
of
turf
to
the
right
of
the
road
from
genappe
to
brussels
which
was
his
second
station
during
the
battle
the
third
station
the
one
adopted
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
between
la
belle
alliance
and
la
haie
sainte
is
formidable
it
is
a
rather
elevated
knoll
which
still
exists
and
behind
which
the
guard
was
massed
on
a
slope
of
the
plain
around
this
knoll
the
balls
rebounded
from
the
pavements
of
the
road
up
to
napoleon
himself
as
at
brienne
he
had
over
his
head
the
shriek
of
the
bullets
and
of
the
heavy
artillery
mouldy
cannon
balls
old
sword
blades
and
shapeless
projectiles
eaten
up
with
rust
were
picked
up
at
the
spot
where
his
horse
feet
stood
scabra
rubigine
a
few
years
ago
a
shell
of
sixty
pounds
still
charged
and
with
its
fuse
broken
off
level
with
the
bomb
was
unearthed
it
was
at
this
last
post
that
the
emperor
said
to
his
guide
lacoste
a
hostile
and
terrified
peasant
who
was
attached
to
the
saddle
of
a
hussar
and
who
turned
round
at
every
discharge
of
canister
and
tried
to
hide
behind
napoleon
fool
it
is
shameful
you
ll
get
yourself
killed
with
a
ball
in
the
back
he
who
writes
these
lines
has
himself
found
in
the
friable
soil
of
this
knoll
on
turning
over
the
sand
the
remains
of
the
neck
of
a
bomb
disintegrated
by
the
oxidization
of
six
and
forty
years
and
old
fragments
of
iron
which
parted
like
elder
twigs
between
the
fingers
every
one
is
aware
that
the
variously
inclined
undulations
of
the
plains
where
the
engagement
between
napoleon
and
wellington
took
place
are
no
longer
what
they
were
on
june
18
1815
by
taking
from
this
mournful
field
the
wherewithal
to
make
a
monument
to
it
its
real
relief
has
been
taken
away
and
history
disconcerted
no
longer
finds
her
bearings
there
it
has
been
disfigured
for
the
sake
of
glorifying
it
wellington
when
he
beheld
waterloo
once
more
two
years
later
exclaimed
they
have
altered
my
field
of
battle
where
the
great
pyramid
of
earth
surmounted
by
the
lion
rises
to
day
there
was
a
hillock
which
descended
in
an
easy
slope
towards
the
nivelles
road
but
which
was
almost
an
escarpment
on
the
side
of
the
highway
to
genappe
the
elevation
of
this
escarpment
can
still
be
measured
by
the
height
of
the
two
knolls
of
the
two
great
sepulchres
which
enclose
the
road
from
genappe
to
brussels
one
the
english
tomb
is
on
the
left
the
other
the
german
tomb
is
on
the
right
there
is
no
french
tomb
the
whole
of
that
plain
is
a
sepulchre
for
france

to
the
thousands

of

the

of

is
now
accessible
by
an
easy
slope
on
the
day
of
battle
particularly
on
the
side
of
la
haie
sainte
it
was
abrupt
and
difficult
of
approach
the
slope
there
is
so
steep
that
the
english
cannon
could
not
see
the
farm
situated
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
which
was
the
centre
of
the
combat
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
the
rains
had
still
farther
increased
this
acclivity
the
mud
complicated
the
problem
of
the
ascent
and
the
men
not
only
slipped
back
but
stuck
fast
in
the
mire
along
the
crest
of
the
plateau
ran
a
sort
of
trench
whose
presence
it
was
impossible
for
the
distant

to
divine
what
was

these

both
of
them
concealed
in
curves
of
the

are
connected
by
a
road
about
a
league
and
a
half
in
length
which
traverses
the
plain
along
its
undulating
level
and
often
enters
and
buries
itself
in
the
hills
like
a
furrow
which
makes
a
ravine
of
this
road
in
some
places
in
1815

at

all
these
stormy
incidents
passing
like
the
clouds
of
battle
before
napoleon
had
hardly
troubled
his
gaze
and
had
not
overshadowed
that
face
of
imperial
certainty
napoleon
was
accustomed
to
gaze
steadily
at
war
he
never
added
up
the
heart
rending
details
cipher
by
cipher
ciphers
mattered
little
to
him
provided
that
they
furnished
the
total
victory
he
was
not
alarmed
if
the
beginnings
did
go
astray
since
he
thought
himself
the
master
and
the
possessor
at
the
end
he
knew
how
to
wait
supposing
himself
to
be
out
of
the
question
and
he
treated
destiny
as
his
equal
he
seemed
to
say
to
fate
thou
wilt
not
dare
composed
half
of
light
and
half
of
shadow
napoleon
thought
himself
protected
in
good
and
tolerated
in
evil
he
had
or
thought
that
he
had
a
connivance
one
might
almost
say
a
complicity
of
events
in
his
favor
which
was
equivalent
to
the
invulnerability
of
antiquity
nevertheless
when
one
has
beresina
leipzig
and
fontainebleau
behind
one
it
seems
as
though
one
might
distrust
waterloo
a
mysterious
frown
becomes
perceptible
in
the
depths
of
the
heavens
at
the
moment
when
wellington
retreated
napoleon
shuddered
he
suddenly
beheld
the
table
land
of
mont
saint
jean
cleared
and
the
van
of
the
english
army
disappear
it
was
rallying
but
hiding
itself
the
emperor
half
rose
in
his
stirrups
the
lightning
of
victory
flashed
from
his
eyes
wellington
driven
into
a
corner
at
the
forest
of
soignes
and
destroyed
that
was
the
definitive
conquest
of
england
by
france
it
was
crecy
poitiers
malplaquet
and
ramillies
avenged
the
man
of
marengo
was
wiping
out
agincourt
so
the
emperor
meditating
on
this
terrible
turn
of
fortune
swept
his
glass
for
the
last
time
over
all
the
points
of
the
field
of
battle
his
guard
standing
behind
him
with
grounded
arms
watched
him
from
below
with
a
sort
of
religion
he
pondered
he
examined
the
slopes
noted
the
declivities
scrutinized
the
clumps
of
trees
the
square
of
rye
the
path
he
seemed
to
be
counting
each
bush
he
gazed
with
some
intentness
at
the
english
barricades
of
the
two
highways
two
large
abatis
of
trees
that
on
the

with

the
only
ones
out
of
all
the

which
commanded
the

and
that
on
the
road
to
nivelles
where
gleamed
the
dutch
bayonets
of
chasse

near
this
barricade
he
observed
the
old
chapel
of
saint
nicholas
painted
white
which
stands
at
the
angle
of
the
cross
road
near
braine
l

he
bent
down
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
the
guide
lacoste
the
guide
made
a
negative
sign
with
his
head
which
was
probably
perfidious
the
emperor
straightened
himself
up
and
fell
to
thinking
wellington
had
drawn
back
all
that
remained
to
do
was
to
complete
this
retreat
by
crushing
him
napoleon
turning

come
in

on

another
in

and
deployed
in
two

between

and
taken
up
their
position
for

in
that

were
set
in

then
a
formidable
spectacle
was
seen
all
their
cavalry
with
upraised
swords
standards
and
trumpets
flung
to
the
breeze
formed
in
columns
by
divisions
descended
by
a
simultaneous
movement
and
like

with
the
precision
of
a
brazen
battering

the
hill
of

plunged
into
the
terrible
depths
in
which
so
many
men
had
already
fallen
disappeared
there
in
the
smoke
then
emerging
from
that
shadow
reappeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
still
compact
and
in
close
ranks
mounting
at
a
full
trot
through
a
storm
of
grape
shot
which
burst
upon
them
the
terrible
muddy
slope
of
the
table
land
of
mont
saint

they
ascended
grave
threatening
imperturbable
in
the
intervals
between
the
musketry
and
the

their
colossal
trampling
was
audible

were

it
seemed
as
though
two
immense
adders
of
steel
were
to
be
seen
crawling
towards
the
crest
of
the
table
land
it
traversed
the
battle
like
a
prodigy
nothing
like
it
had
been
seen
since
the
taking
of

of

by

was
lacking
here
but
ney
was
again

it
seemed
as
though
that
mass
had
become
a
monster
and
had
but
one
soul
each
column
undulated
and
swelled
like
the
ring
of
a
polyp
they
could
be
seen
through
a
vast
cloud
of
smoke
which
was
rent
here
and
there
a
confusion
of
helmets
of
cries
of
sabres
a
stormy
heaving
of
the
cruppers
of
horses
amid
the
cannons
and
the
flourish
of
trumpets
a
terrible
and
disciplined
tumult
over
all
the
cuirasses
like
the
scales
on
the
hydra
these
narrations
seemed
to
belong
to
another
age
something
parallel
to
this
vision
appeared
no
doubt
in
the
ancient
orphic
epics
which
told
of
the
centaurs
the
old
hippanthropes
those
titans
with
human
heads
and
equestrian
chests
who
scaled

at
a

and
the
cuirassiers
did
not
see
them
they
listened
to
the
rise
of
this
flood
of
men
they
heard
the
swelling
noise
of
three
thousand
horse
the
alternate
and
symmetrical
tramp
of
their
hoofs
at
full
trot
the
jingling
of
the
cuirasses
the
clang
of
the
sabres
and
a
sort
of
grand
and
savage
breathing
there
ensued
a
most
terrible
silence
then
all
at
once
a
long
file
of
uplifted
arms
brandishing
sabres
appeared
above
the
crest
and
casques
trumpets
and
standards
and
three
thousand
heads
with
gray
mustaches
shouting
vive
l
empereur
all
this
cavalry
debouched
on
the
plateau
and
it
was
like
the
appearance
of
an
earthquake
all
at
once
a
tragic
incident
on
the
english
left
on
our
right
the
head
of
the
column
of
cuirassiers
reared
up
with
a
frightful
clamor
on
arriving
at
the
culminating
point
of
the
crest
ungovernable
utterly
given
over
to
fury
and
their
course
of
extermination
of
the
squares
and
cannon
the
cuirassiers
had
just
caught
sight
of
a
trench
a
trench
between
them
and
the
english
it
was
the
hollow
road
of
ohain
it
was
a
terrible
moment
the
ravine
was
there
unexpected
yawning
directly
under
the
horses
feet
two
fathoms
deep
between
its
double
slopes
the
second
file
pushed
the
first
into
it
and
the
third
pushed
on
the
second
the
horses
reared
and
fell
backward
landed
on
their
haunches
slid
down
all
four
feet
in
the
air
crushing
and
overwhelming
the
riders
and
there
being
no
means
of
retreat
the
whole
column
being
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
projectile
the
force
which
had
been
acquired
to
crush
the
english
crushed
the
french
the
inexorable
ravine
could
only
yield
when
filled
horses
and
riders
rolled
there
pell
mell
grinding
each
other
forming
but
one
mass
of
flesh
in
this
gulf
when
this
trench
was
full
of
living
men
the
rest
marched
over
them
and
passed
on
almost
a
third
of
dubois
s
brigade
fell
into
that
abyss
this
began
the
loss
of
the
battle
a
local
tradition
which
evidently
exaggerates
matters
says
that
two
thousand
horses
and
fifteen
hundred
men
were
buried
in
the
hollow
road
of
ohain
this
figure
probably
comprises
all
the
other
corpses
which
were
flung
into
this
ravine
the
day
after
the
combat
let
us
note
in
passing
that
it
was
dubois
s
sorely
tried
brigade
which
an
hour
previously
making
a
charge
to
one
side
had
captured
the
flag
of
the
lunenburg
battalion
napoleon
before
giving
the
order
for
this
charge
of
milhaud
s
cuirassiers
had
scrutinized
the
ground
but
had
not
been
able
to
see
that
hollow
road
which
did
not
even
form
a
wrinkle
on
the
surface
of
the

the

no
we

affirm

chapter
x
the
plateau
of
mont
saint
jean
the
battery
was
unmasked
at
the
same
moment
with
the
ravine
sixty
cannons
and
the
thirteen
squares
darted
lightning
point
blank
on
the
cuirassiers
the
intrepid
general
delort
made
the
military
salute
to
the
english
battery
the
whole
of
the
flying
artillery
of
the
english
had
re
entered
the
squares
at
a
gallop
the
cuirassiers
had
not
had
even
the
time
for
a
halt
the
disaster
of
the
hollow
road
had
decimated
but
not
discouraged
them
they
belonged
to
that
class
of
men
who
when
diminished
in
number
increase
in
courage
wathier
s
column
alone
had
suffered
in
the
disaster
delort
s
column
which
ney
had
deflected
to
the
left
as
though
he
had
a
presentiment
of
an
ambush
had
arrived
whole
the
cuirassiers
hurled
themselves
on
the
english
squares
at
full
speed
with
bridles
loose
swords
in
their
teeth
pistols
in
fist
such
was
the
attack
there
are
moments
in
battles
in
which
the
soul
hardens
the
man
until
the
soldier
is
changed
into
a
statue
and
when
all
this
flesh
turns
into
granite
the
english
battalions
desperately
assaulted
did
not
stir
then
it
was
terrible
all
the
faces
of
the
english
squares
were
attacked
at
once
a
frenzied
whirl
enveloped
them
that
cold
infantry
remained
impassive
the
first
rank
knelt
and
received
the
cuirassiers
on
their
bayonets
the
second
ranks
shot
them
down
behind
the
second
rank
the
cannoneers
charged
their
guns
the
front
of
the
square
parted
permitted
the
passage
of
an
eruption
of
grape
shot
and
closed
again
the
cuirassiers
replied
by
crushing
them
their
great
horses
reared
strode
across
the
ranks
leaped
over
the
bayonets
and
fell
gigantic
in
the
midst
of
these
four
living
wells
the
cannon
balls
ploughed
furrows
in
these
cuirassiers
the
cuirassiers
made
breaches
in
the
squares
files
of
men
disappeared
ground
to
dust
under
the
horses
the
bayonets
plunged
into
the
bellies
of
these
centaurs
hence
a
hideousness
of
wounds
which
has
probably
never
been
seen
anywhere
else
the
squares
wasted
by
this
mad
cavalry
closed
up
their
ranks
without
flinching
inexhaustible
in
the
matter
of
grape
shot
they
created
explosions
in
their
assailants
midst
the
form
of
this
combat
was
monstrous
these
squares
were
no
longer
battalions
they
were
craters
those
cuirassiers
were
no
longer
cavalry
they
were
a
tempest
each
square
was
a
volcano
attacked
by
a
cloud
lava
contended
with
lightning
the
square
on
the
extreme
right
the
most
exposed
of
all
being
in
the
air
was
almost
annihilated
at
the
very
first
shock
lt
was
formed
of
the
75th
regiment
of
highlanders
the
bagpipe
player
in
the
centre
dropped
his
melancholy
eyes
filled
with
the
reflections
of
the
forests
and
the
lakes
in
profound
inattention
while
men
were
being
exterminated
around
him
and
seated
on
a
drum
with
his
pibroch
under
his
arm
played
the
highland
airs
these
scotchmen
died
thinking
of
ben
lothian
as
did
the
greeks
recalling
argos
the
sword
of
a
cuirassier
which
hewed
down
the
bagpipes
and
the
arm
which
bore
it
put
an
end
to
the
song
by
killing
the
singer
the
cuirassiers
relatively
few
in
number
and
still
further
diminished
by
the
catastrophe
of
the
ravine
had
almost
the
whole
english
army
against
them
but
they
multiplied
themselves
so
that
each
man
of
them
was
equal
to
ten
nevertheless
some
hanoverian
battalions
yielded
wellington
perceived
it
and
thought
of
his
cavalry
had
napoleon
at
that
same
moment
thought
of
his
infantry
he
would
have
won
the
battle
this
forgetfulness
was
his
great
and
fatal
mistake
all
at
once
the
cuirassiers
who
had
been
the
assailants
found
themselves
assailed
the
english
cavalry
was
at
their
back
before
them
two
squares
behind

on
the
flank
and
in

before
and
in
the
rear
by
infantry
and
cavalry
had
to
face
all
sides
what
mattered
it
to
them
they
were
a
whirlwind
their
valor
was
something
indescribable
in
addition
to
this
they
had
behind
them
the
battery
which
was
still
thundering
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
so
or
they
could
never
have
been
wounded
in
the
back

of

for

nothing
less
than
such

was
needed
it
was
no

a

conflict
it
was
a
shadow
a
fury
a
dizzy
transport
of
souls
and
courage
a
hurricane
of

in
an

the

the

recaptured
captured
again
the
cuirassiers
quitted
the
cavalry
to
return
to
the
infantry
or
to
put
it
more
exactly
the
whole
of
that
formidable
rout
collared
each

without
releasing
the
other

held
firm
there
were
a

assaults
ney

half
the
cuirassiers
remained
on
the
plateau
this
conflict
lasted
two
hours
the
english
army
was
profoundly
shaken
there
is
no
doubt
that
had
they
not
been
enfeebled
in
their
first
shock
by
the
disaster
of
the
hollow
road
the
cuirassiers
would
have
overwhelmed

from

the
guard
bore
to
the
emperor
in
front
of
the
farm
of
la
belle
alliance
wellington
s
situation
had
grown
worse
this
strange
battle
was
like
a
duel
between
two
raging
wounded
men
each
of
whom
still
fighting
and
still
resisting
is
expending
all
his
blood
which
of
the
two
will
be
the
first
to
fall
the
conflict
on
the
plateau
continued
what
had
become
of
the
cuirassiers
no
one
could
have
told
one
thing
is
certain
that
on
the
day
after
the
battle
a
cuirassier
and
his
horse
were
found
dead
among
the
woodwork
of
the
scales
for
vehicles
at
mont
saint
jean
at
the
very
point
where
the
four
roads
from
nivelles
genappe
la
hulpe
and
brussels
meet
and
intersect
each
other
this
horseman
had
pierced
the
english
lines
one
of
the
men
who
picked
up
the
body
still
lives
at
mont
saint
jean
his
name
is
dehaze
he
was
eighteen
years
old
at
that
time
wellington
felt
that
he
was
yielding
the
crisis
was
at
hand
the
cuirassiers
had
not
succeeded
since
the
centre
was
not
broken
through
as
every
one
was
in
possession
of
the
plateau
no
one
held
it
and
in
fact
it
remained
to
a
great
extent
with
the
english
wellington
held
the
village
and
the
culminating
plain
ney
had
only
the
crest
and
the
slope
they
seemed
rooted
in
that
fatal
soil
on
both
sides
but
the
weakening
of
the
english
seemed
irremediable
the
bleeding
of
that
army
was
horrible
kempt
on
the
left
wing
demanded
reinforcements
there
are
none
replied
wellington
he
must
let
himself
be
killed
almost
at
that
same
moment
a
singular
coincidence
which
paints
the
exhaustion
of
the
two
armies
ney
demanded
infantry
from
napoleon
and
napoleon
exclaimed
infantry
where
does
he
expect
me
to
get
it
does
he
think
i
can
make
it
nevertheless
the
english
army
was
in
the
worse
case
of
the
two
the
furious
onsets
of
those
great
squadrons
with
cuirasses
of
iron
and
breasts
of
steel
had
ground
the
infantry
to
nothing
a
few
men
clustered
round
a

according
to
the
testimony
of

who
are

alive
the

such
that

at

that

comes
the

in

drama
chapter
xi
a
bad
guide
to

a
good
guide
to
bulow
the
painful
surprise
of
napoleon
is
well
known
grouchy
hoped
for
blucher
arriving
death
instead
of
life
fate
has
these
turns
the
throne
of
the
world
was
expected
it
was
saint
helena
that
was
seen
if
the
little
shepherd
who
served
as
guide
to
bulow
blucher
s
lieutenant
had
advised
him
to
debouch
from
the
forest
above
frischemont
instead
of
below
plancenoit
the
form
of
the
nineteenth
century
might
perhaps
have
been
different
napoleon
would
have
won
the
battle
of
waterloo
by
any
other
route
than
that
below
plancenoit
the
prussian
army
would
have
come
out
upon
a
ravine
impassable
for
artillery
and
bulow
would
not
have
arrived
now
the
prussian
general
muffling
declares
that
one
hour
s
delay
and
blucher
would
not
have
found
wellington
on
his
feet
the
battle
was
lost
it
was
time
that
bulow
should
arrive
as
will
be
seen
he
had
moreover
been
very
much
delayed
he
had
bivouacked
at
dion
le
mont
and
had
set
out
at
daybreak
but
the
roads
were
impassable
and
his
divisions
stuck
fast
in
the
mire
the
ruts
were
up
to
the
hubs
of
the
cannons
moreover
he
had
been
obliged
to
pass
the
dyle
on
the
narrow
bridge
of
wavre
the
street
leading
to
the
bridge
had
been
fired
by
the
french
so
the
caissons
and
ammunition
wagons
could
not
pass
between
two
rows
of
burning
houses
and
had
been
obliged
to
wait
until
the
conflagration
was
extinguished
it
was
mid
day
before
bulow
s
vanguard
had
been
able
to
reach
chapelle
saint
lambert
had
the
action
been
begun
two
hours
earlier
it
would
have
been
over
at
four
o
clock
and
blucher
would
have
fallen
on
the
battle
won
by
napoleon
such
are
these
immense
risks
proportioned
to
an
infinite
which
we
cannot
comprehend
the
emperor
had
been
the
first
as
early
as
mid
day
to
descry
with
his
field
glass
on
the
extreme
horizon
something
which
had
attracted
his
attention
he
had
said
i
see
yonder
a
cloud
which
seems
to
me
to
be
troops
then
he
asked
the
duc
de
dalmatie
soult
what
do
you
see
in
the
direction
of
chapelle
saint
lambert
the
marshal
levelling
his
glass
answered
four
or
five
thousand
men
sire
evidently
grouchy
but
it
remained
motionless
in
the
mist
all
the
glasses
of
the
staff
had
studied
the
cloud
pointed
out
by
the
emperor
some
said
it
is
trees
the
truth
is
that
the
cloud
did
not
move
the
emperor
detached
domon
s
division
of
light
cavalry
to
reconnoitre
in
that
quarter
bulow
had
not
moved
in
fact
his
vanguard
was
very
feeble
and
could
accomplish
nothing
he
was
obliged
to
wait
for
the
body
of
the
army
corps
and
he
had
received
orders
to
concentrate
his
forces
before
entering
into
line
but
at
five
o
clock
perceiving
wellington
s
peril
blucher
ordered
bulow
to
attack
and
uttered
these
remarkable
words
we
must
give
air
to
the
english
army
a
little
later
the
divisions
of
losthin
hiller
hacke
and
ryssel
deployed
before

the

all

suffer
from
being
somewhat
dazzled
and
in
this

state
they
fumble
about
it
was
a
day
of
lightning
brilliancy
in

a
crumbling
of
the
military

which
to
the
vast
stupefaction
of

drew
all
the

after

the
fall
of

the
defeat
of

in
this
event
stamped
with
superhuman
necessity
the
part
played
by

amounts
to
nothing
if
we
take
waterloo
from
wellington
and

do
we
thereby
deprive
england
and

of
anything
no
neither

enter
into
the

of
waterloo
thank

nations
are

independently
of

lugubrious
feats
of

neither

is
contained

a

is
the
peculiarity
of

and
in
that

england
and
germany
have
a
magnificent
radiance
they
are
majestic
because
they
think
the
elevation
of

which
they
contribute
to
civilization
is
intrinsic
with
them
it
proceeds
from
themselves
and
not
from
an

the
aggrandizement
which
they
have
brought

has
not

it
is

therefore
speak

waterloo

in

they

bonaparte
at
his
dawning
had
encountered
him
in

beaten
him

the

the

had
been
not

struck
as

but
disgraced
who
was
that
corsican
of

twenty
what
signified
that
splendid
ignoramus
who
with
everything
against
him
nothing
in
his
favor
without
provisions
without
ammunition
without
cannon
without
shoes
almost
without
an
army
with
a
mere
handful
of
men
against
masses
hurled
himself
on
europe
combined
and
absurdly
won
victories
in
the
impossible
whence
had
issued
that
fulminating
convict
who
almost
without
taking
breath
and
with
the
same
set
of
combatants
in
hand
pulverized
one
after
the
other

five
armies

who
was
this
novice
in

with
the
effrontery
of
a
luminary
the
academical
military
school
excommunicated
him
and
as
it
lost
its
footing
hence
the
implacable
rancor
of
the
old
caesarism
against
the
new
of
the
regular
sword
against
the
flaming
sword
and
of
the
exchequer
against
genius
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
that
rancor
had
the
last
word
and
beneath
lodi
montebello
montenotte
mantua
arcola
it
wrote
waterloo
a
triumph
of
the
mediocres
which
is
sweet
to
the
majority
destiny
consented
to
this
irony
in
his
decline
napoleon
found
wurmser
the
younger
again
in
front
of
him
in
fact
to
get
wurmser
it
sufficed
to
blanch
the
hair
of
wellington
waterloo
is
a
battle
of
the
first
order
won
by
a
captain
of
the
second
that
which
must
be
admired
in
the
battle
of
waterloo
is
england
the
english
firmness
the
english
resolution
the
english
blood
the
superb
thing
about
england
there
no
offence
to
her
was
herself
it
was
not
her
captain
it
was
her
army
wellington
oddly
ungrateful
declares
in
a
letter
to
lord
bathurst
that
his
army
the
army
which
fought
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
was
a
detestable
army
what
does
that
sombre
intermingling
of
bones
buried
beneath
the
furrows
of
waterloo
think
of
that
england
has
been
too
modest
in
the
matter
of
wellington
to
make
wellington
so
great
is
to
belittle
england
wellington
is
nothing
but
a
hero
like
many
another
those
scotch
grays
those
horse
guards
those
regiments
of
maitland
and
of
mitchell
that
infantry
of
pack
and
kempt
that
cavalry
of
ponsonby
and
somerset
those
highlanders
playing
the
pibroch
under
the
shower
of
grape
shot
those
battalions
of
rylandt
those
utterly
raw
recruits
who
hardly
knew
how
to
handle
a
musket
holding
their
own
against
essling
s
and
rivoli
s
old
troops
that
is
what
was
grand
wellington
was
tenacious
in
that
lay
his
merit
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
lessen
it
but
the
least
of
his
foot
soldiers
and
of
his
cavalry
would
have
been
as
solid
as
he
the
iron
soldier
is
worth
as
much
as
the
iron
duke
as
for
us
all
our
glorification
goes
to
the
english
soldier
to
the
english
army
to
the
english
people
if
trophy
there
be
it
is
to
england
that
the
trophy
is
due
the
column
of
waterloo
would
be
more
just
if
instead
of
the
figure
of
a
man
it
bore
on
high
the
statue
of
a
people
but
this
great
england
will
be
angry
at
what
we
are
saying
here
she
still
cherishes
after
her
own
1688
and
our
1789
the
feudal
illusion
she
believes
in
heredity
and
hierarchy
this
people
surpassed
by
none
in
power
and
glory
regards
itself
as
a
nation
and
not
as
a
people
and
as
a
people
it
willingly
subordinates
itself
and
takes
a
lord
for
its
head
as
a
workman
it
allows
itself
to
be
disdained
as
a
soldier
it
allows
itself
to
be
flogged
it
will
be
remembered
that
at
the
battle
of
inkermann
a
sergeant
who
had
it
appears
saved
the
army
could
not
be
mentioned
by
lord
paglan
as
the
english
military
hierarchy
does
not
permit
any
hero
below
the
grade
of
an
officer
to
be
mentioned
in
the
reports
that
which
we
admire
above
all
in
an
encounter
of
the
nature
of
waterloo
is
the
marvellous
cleverness
of
chance
a
nocturnal

the
whole
of
this
cataclysm
is
wonderfully
conducted
on
the
whole
let
us
say
it
plainly
it
was
more
of
a
massacre
than
of
a
battle
at
waterloo
of
all
pitched
battles
waterloo
is
the
one
which
has

the

the

which
belongs
to
the

the
impassive
support
of

and
it
resembles
all

strolls
there

like

the
hallucination
of

the

again
the
false

tremendous

that

all
this
no

exists
and
yet
it
clashes
together
and
combats
still
and
the

are
empurpled
and
the

there
is

is
waterloo
to
be
considered
good
there
exists
a
very
respectable
liberal
school
which
does
not
hate
waterloo
we
do
not
belong
to
it
to
us
waterloo
is
but
the
stupefied
date
of
liberty
that
such
an
eagle
should
emerge
from
such
an
egg
is
certainly
unexpected
if
one
places
one
s
self
at
the
culminating
point
of
view
of
the
question
waterloo
is
intentionally
a
counter
revolutionary
victory
it
is
europe
against
france
it
is
petersburg
berlin
and
vienna
against
paris
it
is
the
statu
quo
against
the
initiative
it
is
the
14th
of
july
1789
attacked
through
the
20th
of
march
1815
it
is
the
monarchies
clearing
the
decks
in
opposition
to
the
indomitable
french
rioting
the
final
extinction
of
that
vast
people
which
had
been
in

for
twenty
six

such
was
the
dream
the
solidarity
of
the
brunswicks
the
nassaus
the
romanoffs
the
hohenzollerns
the
hapsburgs
with
the
bourbons
waterloo
bears
divine
right
on
its
crupper
it
is
true
that
the
empire
having
been
despotic
the
kingdom
by
the
natural
reaction
of
things
was
forced
to
be
liberal
and
that
a
constitutional
order
was
the
unwilling
result
of
waterloo
to
the
great
regret
of
the
conquerors
it
is
because
revolution
cannot
be
really
conquered
and
that
being
providential
and
absolutely
fatal
it
is
always
cropping
up
afresh
before
waterloo
in
bonaparte
overthrowing
the
old
thrones
after
waterloo
in
louis
xviii
granting
and
conforming
to
the
charter
bonaparte
places
a
postilion
on

of
naples
and
a
sergeant
on
the
throne
of
sweden
employing
inequality
to
demonstrate
equality
louis
xviii
at
saint
ouen
countersigns
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
if
you
wish
to
gain
an
idea
of
what
revolution
is
call
it
progress
and
if
you
wish
to
acquire
an
idea
of
the
nature
of
progress
call
it
to
morrow
to
morrow
fulfils
its
work
irresistibly
and
it
is
already
fulfilling
it
to
day
it
always
reaches
its
goal
strangely
it
employs
wellington
to
make
of
foy
who
was
only
a
soldier
an
orator
foy
falls
at
hougomont
and
rises
again
in
the
tribune
thus
does
progress
proceed
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
tool
for
that
workman
it
does
not
become
disconcerted
but
adjusts
to
its
divine
work
the
man
who
has
bestridden
the
alps
and
the
good
old
tottering
invalid
of
father
elysee
it
makes
use
of
the
gouty
man
as
well
as
of
the
conqueror
of
the
conqueror
without
of
the
gouty
man
within
waterloo
by
cutting
short
the
demolition
of
european
thrones
by
the
sword
had
no
other
effect
than
to
cause
the
revolutionary
work
to
be
continued
in
another
direction
the
slashers
have
finished
it
was
the
turn
of
the
thinkers
the
century
that
waterloo
was
intended
to
arrest
has
pursued
its
march
that
sinister
victory
was
vanquished
by
liberty
in
short
and
incontestably
that
which
triumphed
at
waterloo
that
which
smiled
in
wellington
s
rear
that
which
brought
him
all
the
marshals
staffs
of
europe
including
it
is
said
the
staff
of
a
marshal
of
france
that
which
joyously
trundled
the
barrows
full
of
bones
to
erect
the
knoll
of
the
lion
that
which
triumphantly
inscribed
on
that
pedestal
the
date
june
18
1815
that
which
encouraged
blucher
as
he
put
the
flying
army
to
the
sword
that
which
from
the
heights
of
the
plateau
of
mont
saint

hovered
over
france
as
over
its
prey

ease
with

on

passing
through
the
death
struggle
at

the
sixty
thousand
men
who
had
fallen
on
the
field
of
waterloo
were
quietly
rotting
and
something
of
their
peace
was
shed
abroad
over
the
world
the
congress
of

made
the
treaties

such
tragic
favors
of
the
night
do
occur
sometimes
during
catastrophes
after
the
last
cannon
shot
had
been
fired
the
plain
of

deserted
the
english
occupied
the

of

it
is
the
usual
sign
of

to
sleep
in
the
bed
of
the
vanquished

established
their
bivouac
beyond

the
prussians
let

the
retreating

wellington
went
to
the
village
of

to
draw
up
his
report
to

if
ever
the
sic

non

was

it
certainly
is
to
that
village
of

waterloo
took
no
part
and
lay
half
a

from
the

the

of
the
two
conquerors
these
names
are
hardly
known
and
waterloo
which
worked
not
in
the
battle
bears
off
all
the
honor
we
are
not
of
the
number
of
those
who
flatter
war
when
the
occasion
presents
itself
we
tell
the
truth
about
it
war
has
frightful
beauties
which
we
have
not
concealed
it
has
also
we
acknowledge
some
hideous
features
one
of
the
most
surprising
is
the
prompt
stripping
of
the
bodies
of
the
dead
after
the
victory
the
dawn
which
follows
a
battle
always
rises
on
naked
corpses
who
does
this
who
thus
soils
the
triumph
what
hideous
furtive
hand
is
that
which
is
slipped
into
the
pocket
of
victory
what
pickpockets
are
they
who
ply
their
trade
in
the
rear
of
glory
some
philosophers
voltaire
among
the
number
affirm
that
it
is
precisely
those
persons
have
made
the
glory
it
is
the
same
men
they
say
there
is
no
relief
corps
those
who
are
erect
pillage
those
who
are
prone
on
the
earth
the
hero
of
the
day
is
the
vampire
of
the
night
one
has
assuredly
the
right
after
all
to
strip
a
corpse
a
bit
when
one
is
the
author
of
that
corpse
for
our
own
part
we
do
not
think
so
it
seems
to
us
impossible
that
the
same
hand
should
pluck
laurels
and
purloin
the
shoes
from
a
dead
man
one
thing
is
certain
which
is
that
generally
after
conquerors
follow
thieves
but
let
us
leave
the
soldier
especially
the
contemporary
soldier
out
of
the
question
every
army
has
a
rear
guard
and
it
is
that
which
must
be
blamed
bat
like
creatures
half
brigands
and
lackeys
all
the
sorts
of
vespertillos
that
that
twilight
called
war
engenders
wearers
of
uniforms
who
take
no
part
in
the
fighting
pretended
invalids
formidable
limpers
interloping
sutlers
trotting
along
in
little
carts
sometimes
accompanied
by
their
wives
and
stealing
things
which
they
sell
again
beggars
offering
themselves
as
guides
to
officers
soldiers
servants
marauders
armies
on
the
march
in
days
gone
by
we
are
not
speaking
of
the
present
dragged
all
this
behind
them
so
that
in
the
special
language
they
are
called
stragglers
no
army
no
nation
was
responsible
for
those
beings
they
spoke
italian
and
followed
the
germans
then
spoke
french
and
followed
the
english
it
was
by
one
of
these
wretches
a
spanish
straggler
who
spoke
french
that
the
marquis
of
fervacques
deceived
by
his
picard
jargon
and
taking
him
for
one
of
our
own
men
was
traitorously
slain
and
robbed
on
the
battle
field
itself
in
the
course
of
the
night
which
followed
the
victory
of
cerisoles
the
rascal
sprang
from
this
marauding
the
detestable
maxim
live
on
the
enemy
produced
this
leprosy
which
a
strict
discipline
alone
could
heal
there
are
reputations
which
are
deceptive
one
does
not
always
know
why
certain
generals
great
in
other
directions
have
been
so
popular
turenne
was
adored
by
his
soldiers
because
he
tolerated
pillage
evil
permitted
constitutes
part
of
goodness
turenne
was
so
good
that
he
allowed
the
palatinate
to
be
delivered
over
to
fire
and
blood
the
marauders
in
the
train
of
an
army
were
more
or
less
in
number
according
as
the
chief
was
more
or
less
severe
hoche
and
marceau
had
no
stragglers
wellington
had
few
and
we
do
him
the
justice
to
mention
it
nevertheless
on
the
night
from
the
18th
to
the
19th
of
june
the
dead
were
robbed
wellington
was
rigid
he
gave
orders
that
any
one
caught
in
the
act
should
be
shot
but
rapine
is
tenacious
the
marauders
stole
in
one
corner
of
the
battlefield
while
others
were
being
shot
in
another
the
moon
was
sinister
over
this
plain
towards
midnight
a
man
was
prowling
about
or
rather
climbing
in
the
direction
of
the
hollow
road
of
ohain
to
all
appearance
he
was
one
of
those
whom
we
have
just
described
neither
english
nor
french
neither
peasant
nor
soldier
less
a
man
than
a
ghoul
attracted
by
the
scent
of
the
dead
bodies
having
theft
for
his
victory
and
come
to
rifle
waterloo
he
was
clad
in
a
blouse
that
was
something
like
a
great
coat
he
was
uneasy
and
audacious
he
walked
forwards
and
gazed
behind
him
who
was
this
man
the
night
probably
knew
more
of
him
than
the
day
he
had
no
sack
but
evidently
he
had
large
pockets
under
his
coat
from
time
to
time
he
halted
scrutinized
the
plain
around
him
as
though
to
see
whether
he
were
observed
bent
over
abruptly
disturbed
something
silent
and
motionless
on
the
ground
then
rose
and
fled
his
sliding
motion
his
attitudes
his
mysterious
and
rapid
gestures
caused
him
to
resemble
those
twilight
larvae
which
haunt
ruins
and
which
ancient
norman
legends
call
the
alleurs
certain
nocturnal
wading
birds
produce
these
silhouettes
among
the
marshes
a
glance
capable
of
piercing
all
that
mist
deeply
would
have
perceived
at
some
distance
a
sort
of
little
sutler
s
wagon
with
a
fluted
wicker
hood
harnessed
to
a
famished
nag
which
was
cropping
the
grass
across
its
bit
as
it
halted
hidden
as
it
were
behind
the
hovel
which
adjoins
the
highway
to
nivelles
at
the
angle
of
the
road
from
mont
saint
jean
to
braine
l
alleud
and
in
the
wagon
a
sort
of
woman
seated
on
coffers
and
packages
perhaps
there
was
some
connection
between
that
wagon
and
that
prowler
the
darkness
was
serene
not
a
cloud
in
the
zenith
what
matters
it
if
the
earth
be
red
the
moon
remains
white
these
are
the
indifferences
of
the
sky
in
the
fields
branches
of
trees
broken
by
grape
shot
but
not
fallen
upheld
by
their
bark
swayed
gently
in
the
breeze
of
night
a
breath
almost
a
respiration
moved
the
shrubbery
quivers
which
resembled
the
departure
of
souls
ran
through
the
grass
in
the
distance
the
coming
and
going
of
patrols
and
the
general
rounds
of
the
english
camp
were
audible
hougomont
and
la
haie
sainte
continued
to
burn
forming
one
in
the
west
the
other
in
the
east
two
great
flames
which
were
joined
by
the
cordon
of
bivouac
fires
of
the
english
like
a
necklace
of
rubies
with
two
carbuncles
at
the
extremities
as
they
extended
in
an
immense
semicircle
over
the
hills
along
the
horizon
we
have
described
the
catastrophe
of
the
road
of
ohain
the
heart
is
terrified
at
the
thought
of
what
that
death
must
have
been
to
so
many
brave
men
if
there
is
anything
terrible
if
there
exists
a
reality
which
surpasses
dreams
it
is
this
to
live
to
see
the
sun
to
be
in
full
possession
of
virile
force
to
possess
health
and
joy
to
laugh
valiantly
to
rush
towards
a
glory
which
one
sees
dazzling
in
front
of
one
to
feel
in
one
s
breast
lungs
which
breathe
a
heart
which
beats
a
will
which
reasons
to
speak
think
hope
love
to
have
a
mother
to
have
a
wife
to
have
children
to
have
the
light
and
all
at
once
in
the
space
of
a
shout
in
less
than
a
minute
to
sink
into
an
abyss
to
fall
to
roll
to
crush
to
be
crushed
to
see
ears
of
wheat
flowers
leaves
branches
not
to
be
able
to
catch
hold
of
anything
to
feel
one
s
sword
useless
men
beneath

horses
on
top
of
one
to
struggle
in
vain
since
one
s
bones
have
been
broken
by
some
kick
in
the
darkness
to
feel
a
heel
which
makes
one
s
eyes
start
from
their
sockets
to
bite
horses
shoes
in
one
s
rage
to
stifle
to
yell
to
writhe
to
be
beneath
and
to
say
to
one
s
self
but
just
a
little
while
ago
i
was
a
living
man
there
where
that
lamentable
disaster
had
uttered
its
death
rattle
all
was
silence
now
the
edges
of
the
hollow
road
were
encumbered
with
horses
and
riders
inextricably
heaped
up
terrible
entanglement
there
was
no
longer
any
slope
for
the
corpses
had
levelled
the
road
with
the
plain
and
reached
the
brim
like
a
well
filled
bushel
of
barley
a
heap
of
dead
bodies
in
the
upper
part
a
river
of
blood
in
the
lower
part
such
was
that
road
on
the
evening
of
the
18th
of
june
1815
the
blood
ran
even
to
the
nivelles
highway
and
there
overflowed
in
a
large
pool
in
front
of
the
abatis
of
trees
which
barred
the
way
at
a
spot
which
is
still
pointed
out
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
was
at
the
opposite
point
in
the
direction
of
the
genappe
road
that
the
destruction
of
the
cuirassiers
had
taken
place
the
thickness
of
the
layer
of
bodies
was
proportioned
to
the
depth
of
the
hollow
road
towards
the
middle
at
the
point
where
it
became
level
where
delort
s
division
had
passed
the
layer
of
corpses
was
thinner
the
nocturnal
prowler
whom
we
have
just
shown
to
the
reader
was
going
in
that
direction
he
was
searching
that
vast
tomb
he
gazed
about
he
passed
the
dead
in
some
sort
of
hideous
review
he
walked
with
his
feet
in
the
blood
all
at
once
he
paused
a
few
paces
in
front
of
him
in
the
hollow
road
at
the
point
where
the
pile
of
dead
came
to
an
end
an
open
hand
illumined
by
the
moon
projected
from
beneath
that
heap
of
men
that
hand
had
on
its
finger
something
sparkling
which
was
a
ring
of
gold
the
man
bent
over
remained
in
a
crouching
attitude
for
a
moment
and
when
he
rose
there
was
no
longer
a
ring
on
the
hand
he
did
not
precisely
rise
he
remained
in
a
stooping
and
frightened
attitude
with
his
back
turned
to
the
heap
of
dead
scanning
the
horizon
on
his
knees
with
the
whole
upper
portion
of
his
body
supported
on
his
two
forefingers
which
rested
on
the
earth
and
his
head
peering
above
the
edge
of
the
hollow
road
the
jackal
s
four
paws
suit
some
actions
then
coming
to
a
decision
he
rose
to
his
feet
at
that
moment
he
gave
a
terrible
start
he
felt
some
one
clutch
him
from
behind
he
wheeled
round
it
was
the
open
hand
which
had
closed
and
had
seized
the
skirt
of
his
coat
an
honest
man
would
have
been
terrified
this
man
burst
into
a
laugh
come
said
he
it
s
only
a
dead
body
i
prefer
a
spook
to
a
gendarme
but
the
hand
weakened
and
released
him
effort
is
quickly
exhausted
in
the
grave
well
now
said
the
prowler
is
that
dead
fellow
alive
let
s
see
he
bent
down
again
fumbled
among
the
heap
pushed
aside
everything
that
was
in
his
way
seized
the
hand
grasped
the
arm
freed
the
head
pulled
out
the
body
and
a
few
moments
later
he
was
dragging
the
lifeless
or
at
least
the
unconscious
man
through
the
shadows
of
hollow
road
he
was
a
cuirassier
an
officer
and
even
an
officer
of
considerable
rank
a
large
gold
epaulette
peeped
from
beneath
the
cuirass
this
officer
no
longer
possessed
a
helmet
a
furious
sword
cut
had
scarred
his
face
where
nothing
was
discernible
but
blood
however
he
did
not
appear
to
have
any
broken
limbs
and
by
some
happy
chance
if
that
word
is
permissible
here
the
dead
had
been
vaulted
above
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preserve
him
from
being
crushed
his
eyes
were
still
closed
on
his
cuirass
he
wore
the
silver
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
prowler
tore
off
this
cross
which
disappeared
into
one
of
the
gulfs
which
he
had
beneath
his
great
coat
then
he
felt
of
the
officer
s
fob
discovered
a
watch
there
and
took
possession
of
it
next
he
searched
his
waistcoat
found
a
purse
and
pocketed
it
when
he
had
arrived
at
this
stage
of
succor
which
he
was
administering
to
this
dying
man
the
officer
opened
his
eyes
thanks
he
said
feebly
the
abruptness
of
the
movements
of
the
man
who
was
manipulating
him
the
freshness
of
the
night
the
air
which
he
could
inhale
freely
had
roused
him
from
his
lethargy
the
prowler
made
no
reply
he
raised
his
head
a
sound
of
footsteps
was
audible
in
the
plain
some
patrol
was
probably
approaching
the
officer
murmured
for
the
death
agony
was
still
in
his
voice
who
won
the
battle
the
english
answered
the
prowler
the
officer
went
on
look
in
my
pockets
you
will
find
a
watch
and
a
purse
take
them
it
was
already
done
the
prowler
executed
the
required
feint
and
said
there
is
nothing
there
i
have
been
robbed
said
the
officer
i
am
sorry
for
that
you
should
have
had
them
the
steps
of
the
patrol
became
more
and
more
distinct
some
one
is
coming
said
the
prowler
with
the
movement
of
a
man
who
is
taking
his
departure
the
officer
raised
his
arm
feebly
and
detained
him
you
have
saved
my
life
who
are
you
the
prowler
answered
rapidly
and
in
a
low
voice
like
yourself
i
belonged
to
the
french
army
i
must
leave
you
if
they
were
to
catch
me
they
would
shoot

jean
valjean
had
been
recaptured
the
reader
will
be
grateful
to
us
if
we
pass
rapidly
over
the
sad
details
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
transcribing
two
paragraphs
published
by
the
journals
of
that
day
a
few
months
after
the
surprising
events
which
had
taken
place
at
m
sur
m
these
articles
are
rather
summary
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
that
epoch
the
gazette
des
tribunaux
was
not
yet
in
existence
we
borrow
the
first
from
the
drapeau
blanc
it
bears
the
date
of
july
25
1823
an
arrondissement
of
the
pas
de
calais
has
just
been
the
theatre
of
an
event
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
course
a
man
who
was
a
stranger
in
the
department
and
who
bore
the
name
of
m
madeleine
had
thanks
to
the
new
methods
resuscitated
some
years
ago
an
ancient
local
industry
the
manufacture
of
jet
and
of
black
glass
trinkets
he
had
made
his
fortune
in
the
business
and
that
of
the
arrondissement
as
well
we
will
admit
he
had
been
appointed
mayor
in
recognition
of
his
services
the
police
discovered
that
m
madeleine
was
no
other
than
an
ex
convict
who
had
broken
his
ban
condemned
in
1796
for
theft
and
named
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
has
been
recommitted
to
prison
it
appears
that
previous
to
his
arrest
he
had
succeeded
in
withdrawing
from
the
hands
of
m
laffitte
a
sum
of
over
half
a
million
which
he
had
lodged
there
and
which
he
had
moreover
and
by
perfectly
legitimate
means
acquired
in
his
business
no
one
has
been
able
to
discover
where
jean
valjean
has
concealed
this
money
since
his
return
to
prison
at
toulon
the
second
article
which
enters
a
little
more
into
detail
is
an
extract
from
the
journal
de
paris
of
the
same
date
a
former
convict
who
had
been
liberated
named
jean
valjean
has
just
appeared
before
the
court
of
assizes
of
the
var
under
circumstances
calculated
to
attract
attention
this
wretch
had
succeeded
in
escaping
the
vigilance
of
the
police
he
had
changed
his
name
and
had
succeeded
in
getting
himself
appointed
mayor
of
one
of
our
small
northern
towns
in
this
town
he
had
established
a
considerable
commerce
he
has
at
last
been
unmasked
and
arrested
thanks
to
the
indefatigable
zeal
of
the
public
prosecutor
he
had
for
his
concubine
a
woman
of
the
town
who
died
of
a
shock
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
this
scoundrel
who
is
endowed
with
herculean
strength
found
means
to
escape
but
three
or
four
days
after
his
flight
the
police
laid
their
hands
on
him
once
more
in
paris
itself
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
entering
one
of
those
little
vehicles
which
run
between
the
capital
and
the
village
of
montfermeil
seine
et
oise
he
is
said
to
have
profited
by
this
interval
of
three
or
four
days
of
liberty
to
withdraw
a
considerable
sum
deposited
by
him
with
one
of
our
leading
bankers
this
sum
has
been
estimated
at
six
or
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
if
the
indictment
is
to
be
trusted
he
has
hidden
it
in
some
place
known
to
himself
alone
and
it
has
not
been
possible
to
lay
hands
on
it
however
that
may
be
the
said
jean
valjean
has
just
been
brought
before
the
assizes
of
the
department
of
the
var
as
accused
of
highway
robbery
accompanied
with
violence
about
eight
years
ago
on
the
person
of
one
of
those
honest
children
who
as
the
patriarch
of
ferney
has
said
in
immortal
verse
arrive
from
savoy
every
year
and
who
with
gentle
hands
do
clear
those
long
canals
choked
up
with
soot
this
bandit
refused
to
defend
himself
it
was
proved
by
the
skilful
and
eloquent
representative
of
the
public
prosecutor
that
the
theft
was
committed
in
complicity
with
others
and
that
jean
valjean
was
a
member
of
a
band
of
robbers
in
the
south
jean
valjean
was
pronounced
guilty
and
was
condemned
to
the
death
penalty
in
consequence
this
criminal
refused
to
lodge
an
appeal
the
king
in
his
inexhaustible
clemency
has
deigned
to
commute
his
penalty
to
that
of
penal
servitude
for
life
jean
valjean
was
immediately
taken
to
the
prison
at
toulon
the
reader
has
not
forgotten
that
jean
valjean
had
religious
habits
at
m
sur
m
some
papers
among
others
the
constitutional
presented
this
commutation
as
a
triumph
of
the
priestly
party
jean
valjean
changed
his
number
in
the
galleys
he
was
called
9
430
however
and
we
will
mention
it
at
once
in
order
that
we
may
not
be
obliged
to
recur
to
the
subject
the
prosperity
of
m
sur
m
vanished
with
m
madeleine
all
that
he
had
foreseen
during
his
night
of
fever
and
hesitation
was
realized
lacking
him
there
actually
was
a
soul
lacking
after
this
fall
there
took
place
at
m
sur
m
that
egotistical
division
of
great
existences
which
have
fallen
that
fatal
dismemberment
of
flourishing
things
which
is
accomplished
every
day
obscurely
in
the
human
community
and
which
history
has
noted
only
once
because
it
occurred
after
the
death
of
alexander
lieutenants
are
crowned
kings
superintendents
improvise
manufacturers
out
of
themselves
envious
rivalries
arose
m
madeleine
s
vast
workshops
were
shut
his
buildings
fell
to
ruin
his
workmen
were
scattered
some
of
them
quitted
the
country
others
abandoned
the
trade
thenceforth
everything
was
done
on
a
small
scale
instead
of
on
a
grand
scale
for
lucre
instead
of
the
general
good
there
was
no
longer
a
centre
everywhere
there
was
competition
and
animosity
m
madeleine
had
reigned
over
all
and
directed
all
no
sooner
had
he
fallen
than
each
pulled
things
to
himself
the
spirit
of
combat
succeeded
to
the
spirit
of
organization
bitterness
to
cordiality
hatred
of
one
another
to
the
benevolence
of
the
founder
towards
all
the
threads
which
m
madeleine
had
set
were
tangled
and
broken
the
methods
were
adulterated
the
products
were
debased
confidence
was
killed
the
market
diminished
for
lack
of
orders
salaries
were
reduced
the
workshops
stood
still
bankruptcy
arrived
and
then
there
was
nothing
more
for
the
poor
all
had
vanished
the
state
itself
perceived
that
some
one
had
been
crushed
somewhere
less
than
four
years
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
assizes
establishing
the
identity
of
jean
valjean
and
m
madeleine
for
the
benefit
of
the
galleys
the
cost
of
collecting
taxes
had
doubled
in
the
arrondissement
of
m
sur
m
and
m
de
villele
called
attention
to
the
fact
in
the
rostrum
in
the
month
of
february
1827
chapter
ii
in
which
the
reader
will
peruse
two
verses
which
are
of
the
devil
s
composition
possibly
before
proceeding
further
it
will
be
to
the
purpose
to
narrate
in
some
detail
a
singular
occurrence
which
took
place
at
about
the
same
epoch
in
montfermeil
and
which
is
not
lacking
in
coincidence
with
certain
conjectures
of
the
indictment
there
exists
in
the
region
of
montfermeil
a
very
ancient
superstition
which
is
all
the
more
curious
and
all
the
more
precious
because
a
popular
superstition
in
the
vicinity
of
paris
is
like
an
aloe
in
siberia
we
are
among
those
who
respect
everything
which
is
in
the
nature
of
a
rare
plant
here
then
is
the
superstition
of
montfermeil
it
is
thought
that
the
devil
from
time
immemorial
has
selected
the
forest
as
a
hiding
place
for
his
treasures
goodwives
affirm
that
it
is
no
rarity
to
encounter
at
nightfall
in
secluded
nooks
of
the
forest
a
black
man
with
the
air
of
a
carter
or
a
wood
chopper
wearing
wooden
shoes
clad
in
trousers
and
a
blouse
of
linen
and
recognizable
by
the
fact
that
instead
of
a
cap
or
hat
he
has
two
immense
horns
on
his
head
this
ought
in
fact
to
render
him
recognizable
this
man
is
habitually
engaged
in
digging
a
hole
there
are
three
ways
of
profiting
by
such
an
encounter
the
first
is
to
approach
the
man
and
speak
to
him
then
it
is
seen
that
the
man
is
simply
a
peasant
that
he
appears
black
because
it
is
nightfall
that
he
is
not
digging
any
hole
whatever
but
is
cutting
grass
for
his
cows
and
that
what
had
been
taken
for
horns
is
nothing
but
a
dung
fork
which
he
is
carrying
on
his
back
and
whose
teeth
thanks
to
the
perspective
of
evening
seemed
to
spring
from
his
head
the
man
returns
home
and
dies
within
the
week
the
second
way
is
to
watch
him
to
wait
until
he
has
dug
his
hole
until
he
has
filled
it
and
has
gone
away
then
to
run
with
great
speed
to
the
trench
to
open
it
once
more
and
to
seize
the
treasure
which
the
black
man
has
necessarily
placed
there
in
this
case
one
dies
within
the
month
finally
the
last
method
is
not
to
speak
to
the
black
man
not
to
look
at
him
and
to
flee
at
the
best
speed
of
one
s
legs
one
then
dies
within
the
year
as
all
three
methods
are
attended
with
their
special
inconveniences
the
second
which
at
all
events
presents
some
advantages
among
others
that
of
possessing
a
treasure
if
only
for
a
month
is
the
one
most
generally
adopted
so
bold
men
who
are
tempted
by
every
chance
have
quite
frequently
as
we
are
assured
opened
the
holes
excavated
by
the
black
man
and
tried
to
rob
the
devil
the
success
of
the
operation
appears
to
be
but
moderate
at
least
if
the
tradition
is
to
be
believed
and
in
particular
the
two
enigmatical
lines
in
barbarous
latin
which
an
evil
norman
monk
a
bit
of
a
sorcerer
named
tryphon
has
left
on
this
subject
this
tryphon
is
buried
at
the
abbey
of
saint
georges
de
bocherville
near
rouen
and
toads
spawn
on
his
grave
accordingly
enormous
efforts
are
made
such
trenches
are
ordinarily
extremely
deep
a
man
sweats
digs
toils
all
night
for
it
must
be
done
at
night
he
wets
his
shirt
burns
out
his
candle
breaks
his
mattock
and
when
he
arrives
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
when
he
lays
his
hand
on
the
treasure
what
does
he
find
what
is
the
devil
s
treasure
a
sou
sometimes
a
crown
piece
a
stone
a
skeleton
a
bleeding
body
sometimes
a
spectre
folded
in
four
like
a
sheet
of
paper
in
a
portfolio
sometimes
nothing
this
is
what
tryphon
s
verses
seem
to
announce
to
the
indiscreet
and
curious
fodit
et
in
fossa
thesauros
condit
opaca
as
nummas
lapides
cadaver
simulacra
nihilque
it
seems
that
in
our
day
there
is
sometimes
found
a
powder
horn
with
bullets
sometimes
an
old
pack
of
cards
greasy
and
worn
which
has
evidently
served
the
devil
tryphon

these
two
finds
since
tryphon
lived

century
and
since
the

to
have
had
the
wit
to
invent
powder
before
roger
bacon

time
and
cards
before
the
time
of
charles

moreover
if
one
plays
at
cards
one
is
sure
to
lose
all
that
one
possesses
and
as
for
the
powder
in
the
horn
it
possesses
the
property
of
making
your
gun
burst
in
your
face
now
a
very
short
time
after
the
epoch
when
it
seemed
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
that
the
liberated
convict
jean
valjean
during
his
flight
of
several
days
had
been
prowling
around
montfermeil
it
was
remarked
in
that
village
that
a
certain
old
road
laborer
named
boulatruelle
had
peculiar
ways
in
the
forest
people
thereabouts
thought
they
knew
that
this
boulatruelle
had
been
in
the
galleys
he
was
subjected
to
certain
police
supervision
and
as
he
could
find
work
nowhere
the
administration
employed
him
at
reduced
rates
as
a
road
mender
on
the
cross
road
from
gagny
to
lagny
this
boulatruelle
was
a
man
who
was
viewed
with
disfavor
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
as
too
respectful
too
humble
too
prompt
in
removing
his
cap
to
every
one
and
trembling
and
smiling
in
the
presence
of
the
gendarmes
probably
affiliated
to
robber
bands
they
said
suspected
of
lying
in
ambush
at
verge
of
copses
at
nightfall
the
only
thing
in
his
favor
was
that
he
was
a
drunkard
this
is
what
people
thought
they
had
noticed
of
late
boulatruelle
had
taken
to
quitting
his
task
of
stone
breaking
and
care
of
the
road
at
a
very
early
hour
and
to
betaking
himself
to
the
forest
with
his
pickaxe
he
was
encountered
towards
evening
in
the
most
deserted
clearings
in
the
wildest
thickets
and
he
had
the
appearance
of
being
in
search
of
something
and
sometimes
he
was
digging
holes
the
goodwives
who
passed
took
him
at
first
for
beelzebub
then
they
recognized
boulatruelle
and
were
not
in
the
least
reassured
thereby
these
encounters
seemed
to
cause
boulatruelle
a
lively
displeasure
it
was
evident
that
he
sought
to
hide
and
that
there
was
some
mystery
in
what
he
was
doing
it
was
said
in
the
village
it
is
clear
that
the
devil
has
appeared
boulatruelle
has
seen
him
and
is
on
the
search
in
sooth
he
is
cunning
enough
to
pocket
lucifer
s
hoard
the
voltairians
added
will
boulatruelle
catch
the
devil
or
will
the
devil
catch
boulatruelle
the
old
women
made
a
great
many
signs
of
the
cross
in
the
meantime
boulatruelle
s
manoeuvres
in
the
forest
ceased
and
he
resumed
his
regular
occupation
of
roadmending
and
people
gossiped
of
something
else
some
persons
however
were
still
curious
surmising
that
in
all
this
there
was
probably
no
fabulous
treasure
of
the
legends
but
some
fine
windfall
of
a
more
serious
and
palpable
sort
than
the
devil
s
bank
bills
and
that
the
road
mender
had
half
discovered
the
secret
the
most
puzzled
were
the
school
master
and
thenardier
the
proprietor
of
the
tavern
who
was
everybody
s
friend
and
had
not
disdained
to
ally
himself
with
boulatruelle
he
has
been
in
the
galleys
said
thenardier
eh
good
god
no
one
knows
who
has
been
there
or
will
be
there
one
evening
the
schoolmaster
affirmed
that
in
former
times
the
law
would
have
instituted
an
inquiry
as
to
what
boulatruelle
did
in
the
forest
and
that
the
latter
would
have
been
forced
to
speak
and
that
he
would
have
been
put
to
the
torture
in
case
of
need
and
that
boulatruelle
would
not
have
resisted
the
water
test
for
example
let
us
put
him
to
the
wine
test
said
thenardier
they
made
an
effort
and
got
the
old
road
mender
to
drinking
boulatruelle
drank
an
enormous
amount
but
said
very
little
he
combined
with
admirable
art
and
in
masterly
proportions
the
thirst
of
a
gormandizer
with
the
discretion
of
a
judge
nevertheless
by
dint
of
returning
to
the
charge
and
of
comparing
and
putting
together
the
few
obscure
words
which
he
did
allow
to
escape
him
this
is
what
thenardier
and
the
schoolmaster
imagined
that
they
had
made
out
one
morning
when
boulatruelle
was
on
his
way
to
his
work
at
daybreak
he
had
been
surprised
to
see
at
a
nook
of
the
forest
in
the
underbrush
a
shovel
and
a
pickaxe
concealed
as
one
might
say
however
he
might
have
supposed
that
they
were
probably
the
shovel
and
pick
of
father
six
fours
the
water
carrier
and
would
have
thought
no
more
about
it
but
on
the
evening
of
that
day
he
saw
without
being
seen
himself
as
he
was
hidden
by
a
large
tree
a
person
who
did
not
belong
in
those
parts
and
whom
he
boulatruelle
knew
well
directing
his
steps
towards
the
densest
part
of
the
wood
translation
by
thenardier
a
comrade
of
the
galleys
boulatruelle
obstinately
refused
to
reveal
his
name
this
person
carried
a
package
something
square
like
a
large
box
or
a
small
trunk
surprise
on
the
part
of
boulatruelle
however
it
was
only
after
the
expiration
of
seven
or
eight
minutes
that
the
idea
of
following
that
person
had
occurred
to
him
but
it
was
too
late
the
person
was
already
in
the
thicket
night
had
descended
and
boulatruelle
had
not
been
able
to
catch
up
with
him
then
he
had
adopted
the
course
of
watching
for
him
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
it
was
moonlight
two
or
three
hours
later
boulatruelle
had
seen
this
person
emerge
from
the
brushwood
carrying
no
longer
the
coffer
but
a
shovel
and
pick
boulatruelle
had
allowed
the
person
to
pass
and
had
not
dreamed
of
accosting
him
because
he
said
to
himself
that
the
other
man
was
three
times
as
strong
as
he
was
and
armed
with
a
pickaxe
and
that
he
would
probably
knock
him
over
the
head
on
recognizing
him
and
on
perceiving
that
he
was
recognized
touching
effusion
of
two
old
comrades
on
meeting
again
but
the
shovel
and
pick
had
served
as
a
ray
of
light
to
boulatruelle
he
had
hastened
to
the
thicket
in
the
morning
and
had
found
neither
shovel
nor
pick
from
this
he
had
drawn
the
inference
that
this
person
once
in
the
forest
had
dug
a
hole
with
his
pick
buried
the
coffer
and
reclosed
the
hole
with
his
shovel
now
the
coffer
was
too
small
to
contain
a
body
therefore
it
contained
money
hence
his
researches
boulatruelle
had
explored
sounded
searched
the
entire
forest
and
the
thicket
and
had
dug
wherever
the
earth
appeared
to
him
to
have
been
recently
turned
up
in
vain
he
had
ferreted
out
nothing
no
one
in
montfermeil
thought
any
more
about
it
there
were
only
a
few
brave
gossips
who
said
you
may
be
certain
that
the
mender
on
the
gagny
road
did
not
take
all
that
trouble
for
nothing
he
was
sure
that
the
devil
had
come

its

some

were

the
taking

was
a

military
action
but
after
all
we
repeat
the

give

a
cracked
sound
the
whole

was
suspicious
history
approves
of
france
for
making
a
difficulty
about
accepting
this
false
triumph
it
seemed
evident
that
certain
spanish
officers
charged
with

yielded
too
easily
the
idea
of
corruption
was
connected
with
the
victory
it
appears
as
though
generals
and
not
battles
had
been
won
and
the
conquering
soldier
returned
humiliated

debasing
war
in

frowned
in

at

easy
surrender

began
to
regret

it
is
the
nature
of

to
prefer
to
have
rostopchine
rather
than
ballesteros
in

of
her
from
a
still
more
serious
point
of
view
and
one
which
it
is
also
proper
to
insist
upon
here
this
war
which
wounded
the
military
spirit
of
france
enraged
the
democratic
spirit
it
was
an
enterprise
of
inthralment
in
that
campaign
the
object
of
the
french
soldier
the
son
of
democracy
was
the
conquest
of
a
yoke
for
others
a
hideous
contradiction
france

not
to

who
said
it
the

an
outrage
on
the
generous
spanish
nation
was
then
at
the
same
time
an
outrage
on
the
french

it
was
france
who
committed
this
monstrous
violence
by
foul

for

the
exception
of

of

everything
that
armies
do
is
by
foul

the

obedience
indicate
this
an

is
a
strange
masterpiece
of
combination
where
force
results
from
an
enormous
sum
of
impotence
thus
is
war
made
by
humanity
against
humanity
despite
humanity
explained
as
for
the
bourbons
the
war
of
1823
was
fatal
to
them
they
took
it
for
a
success
they
did
not
perceive
the
danger
that
lies
in
having
an
idea
slain
to
order
they
went
astray
in
their
innocence
to
such
a
degree
that
they
introduced
the
immense
enfeeblement
of
a
crime
into
their
establishment
as
an
element
of
strength
the
spirit
of
the
ambush
entered
into
their
politics
1830
had
its
germ
in
1823
the
spanish
campaign
became
in
their
counsels
an
argument
for
force
and
for
adventures
by
right
divine
france
having
re
established
elrey
netto
in
spain
might
well
have
re
established
the
absolute

at

they
fell
into
the
alarming
error
of
taking
the
obedience
of
the
soldier
for
the
consent
of
the
nation
such
confidence
is
the
ruin
of
thrones
it
is
not
permitted
to
fall
asleep
either
in
the
shadow
of
a

nor
in
the
shadow

let
us
return
to

during
the
operations
of
the

commanded
by

generalissimo
a

been
cruising
in

we
have
just
stated
that
the
orion
belonged
to
this
fleet
and
that
accidents
of
the
sea
had
brought
it
into
port
at
toulon
the
presence
of
a
vessel
of
war
in
a
port
has
something
about
it
which
attracts
and
engages
a
crowd
it
is
because
it
is
great
and
the
crowd
loves
what
is
great
a
ship
of
the
line
is
one
of
the
most
magnificent
combinations
of
the
genius
of
man
with
the
powers
of
nature
a
ship
of
the
line
is
composed
at
the
same
time
of
the
heaviest
and
the
lightest
of
possible
matter
for
it
deals
at
one
and
the
same
time
with
three
forms
of
substance
solid
liquid
and
fluid
and
it
must
do
battle
with
all
three
it
has
eleven
claws
of
iron
with
which
to
seize
the
granite
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
more
wings
and
more
antennae
than
winged
insects
to
catch
the
wind
in
the
clouds
its
breath
pours
out
through
its
hundred
and
twenty
cannons
as
through
enormous
trumpets
and
replies
proudly
to
the
thunder
the
ocean
seeks
to
lead
it
astray
in
the
alarming
sameness
of
its
billows
but
the
vessel
has
its
soul
its
compass
which
counsels
it
and
always
shows
it
the
north
in
the
blackest
nights
its
lanterns
supply
the
place
of
the
stars
thus
against
the
wind
it
has
its
cordage
and
its
canvas
against
the
water
wood
against
the
rocks
its
iron
brass
and
lead
against
the
shadows
its
light
against
immensity
a
needle
if
one
wishes
to
form
an
idea
of
all
those
gigantic
proportions
which
taken
as
a
whole
constitute
the
ship
of
the
line

the

on

and
how
much

is
required
to
make
this

three
thousand
cubic
metres
it
is
a
floating

and
moreover
let
this
be
borne
in
mind
it
is
only
a
question
here
of
the
military
vessel
of
forty
years
ago
of
the
simple
sailing
vessel
steam
then
in
its
infancy
has
since
added
new
miracles
to
that
prodigy
which
is
called
a
war
vessel
at
the
present
time
for
example
the
mixed
vessel
with
a
screw
is
a
surprising
machine
propelled
by
three
thousand
square
metres
of
canvas
and
by
an
engine
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
horse
power
not
to
mention
these
new
marvels
the
ancient
vessel
of
christopher
columbus
and
of
de
ruyter
is
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
man
it
is
as
inexhaustible
in
force
as
is
the
infinite
in
gales
it
stores
up
the
wind
in
its
sails
it
is
precise
in
the
immense
vagueness
of
the
billows
it
floats
and
it
reigns
there
comes
an
hour
nevertheless
when
the
gale
breaks
that
sixty
foot
yard
like
a
straw
when
the
wind
bends
that
mast
four
hundred
feet
tall
when
that
anchor
which
weighs
tens
of
thousands
is
twisted
in
the
jaws
of
the
waves
like
a
fisherman
s
hook
in
the
jaws
of
a
pike
when
those
monstrous
cannons
utter
plaintive
and
futile
roars
which
the
hurricane
bears
forth
into
the
void
and
into
night
when
all
that
power
and
all
that
majesty
are
engulfed
in
a
power
and
majesty
which
are
superior
every
time
that
immense
force
is
displayed
to
culminate
in
an
immense
feebleness
it
affords
men
food
for
thought
hence
in
the
ports
curious
people
abound
around
these
marvellous
machines
of
war
and
of
navigation
without
being
able
to
explain
perfectly
to
themselves
why
every
day
accordingly
from
morning
until
night
the
quays
sluices
and
the
jetties
of
the
port
of
toulon
were
covered
with
a
multitude
of
idlers
and
loungers
as
they
say
in
paris
whose
business
consisted
in
staring
at
the
orion
the
orion
was
a
ship
that
had
been
ailing
for
a
long
time
in
the
course
of
its
previous
cruises
thick
layers
of
barnacles
had
collected
on
its
keel
to
such
a
degree
as
to
deprive
it
of
half
its
speed
it
had
gone
into
the
dry
dock
the
year
before
this
in
order
to
have
the
barnacles
scraped
off
then
it
had
put
to
sea
again
but
this
cleaning
had
affected
the
bolts
of
the
keel
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
balearic
isles
the
sides
had
been
strained
and
had
opened
and
as
the
plating
in
those
days
was
not
of
sheet
iron
the
vessel
had
sprung
a
leak
a
violent
equinoctial
gale
had
come
up
which
had
first
staved
in
a
grating
and
a
porthole
on
the
larboard
side
and
damaged
the
foretop
gallant
shrouds
in
consequence
of
these
injuries
the
orion
had
run
back
to
toulon
it
anchored
near
the
arsenal
it
was
fully
equipped
and
repairs
were
begun
the
hull
had
received
no
damage
on
the
starboard
but
some
of
the
planks
had
been
unnailed
here
and
there
according
to
custom
to
permit
of
air
entering
the
hold
one
morning
the
crowd
which
was
gazing
at
it
witnessed
an
accident
illustration

orion
an
accident

the
ship
orion
the
crew
was
busy
bending
the
sails
the
topman
who
had
to
take
the
upper
corner
of
the
main
top
sail
on
the
starboard
lost
his
balance
he
was
seen
to
waver
the
multitude
thronging
the
arsenal
quay
uttered
a
cry
the
man
s
head
overbalanced
his
body
the
man
fell
around
the
yard
with
his
hands
outstretched
towards
the
abyss
on
his
way
he
seized
the
footrope
first
with
one
hand
then
with
the
other
and
remained
hanging
from
it
the
sea
lay
below
him
at
a
dizzy
depth
the
shock
of
his
fall
had
imparted
to
the
foot
rope
a
violent
swinging
motion
the
man
swayed
back
and
forth
at
the
end
of
that
rope
like
a
stone
in
a
sling
it
was
incurring
a
frightful
risk
to
go
to
his
assistance
not
one
of
the
sailors
all
fishermen
of
the
coast
recently
levied
for
the
service
dared
to
attempt
it
in
the
meantime
the
unfortunate
topman
was
losing
his
strength
his
anguish
could
not
be
discerned
on
his
face
but
his
exhaustion
was
visible
in
every
limb
his
arms
were
contracted
in
horrible
twitchings
every
effort
which
he
made
to
re
ascend
served
but
to
augment
the
oscillations
of
the
foot
rope
he
did
not
shout
for
fear
of
exhausting
his
strength
all
were
awaiting
the
minute
when
he
should
release
his
hold
on
the
rope
and
from
instant
to
instant
heads
were
turned
aside
that
his
fall
might
not
be
seen
there
are
moments
when
a
bit
of
rope
a
pole
the
branch
of
a
tree
is
life
itself
and
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
see
a
living
being
detach
himself
from
it
and
fall
like
a
ripe
fruit
all
at
once
a
man
was
seen
climbing
into
the
rigging
with
the
agility
of
a
tiger
cat
this
man
was
dressed
in
red
he
was
a
convict
he
wore
a
green
cap
he
was
a
life
convict
on
arriving
on
a
level
with
the
top
a
gust
of
wind
carried
away
his
cap
and
allowed
a
perfectly
white
head
to
be
seen
he
was
not
a
young
man
a
convict
employed
on
board
with
a
detachment
from
the
galleys
had
in
fact
at
the
very
first
instant
hastened
to
the
officer
of
the
watch
and
in
the
midst
of
the
consternation
and
the
hesitation
of
the
crew
while
all
the
sailors
were
trembling
and
drawing
back
he
had
asked
the
officer
s
permission
to
risk
his
life
to
save
the
topman
at
an
affirmative
sign
from
the
officer
he
had
broken
the
chain
riveted
to
his
ankle
with
one
blow
of
a
hammer
then
he
had
caught
up
a
rope
and
had
dashed
into
the
rigging
no
one
noticed
at
the
instant
with
what
ease
that
chain
had
been
broken
it
was
only
later
on
that
the
incident
was
recalled
in
a
twinkling
he
was
on
the
yard
he
paused
for
a
few
seconds
and
appeared
to
be
measuring
it
with
his
eye
these
seconds
during
which
the
breeze
swayed
the
topman
at
the
extremity
of
a
thread
seemed
centuries
to
those
who
were
looking
on
at
last
the
convict
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
advanced
a
step
the
crowd
drew
a
long
breath
he
was
seen
to
run
out
along
the
yard
on
arriving
at
the
point
he
fastened
the
rope
which
he
had
brought
to
it
and
allowed
the
other
end
to
hang
down
then
he
began
to
descend
the
rope
hand
over
hand
and
then
and
the
anguish
was
indescribable
instead
of
one
man
suspended
over
the
gulf
there
were
two
one
would
have
said
it
was
a
spider
coming
to
seize
a
fly
only
here
the
spider
brought
life
not
death
ten
thousand
glances
were
fastened
on
this
group
not
a
cry
not
a
word
the
same
tremor
contracted
every
brow
all
mouths
held
their
breath
as
though
they
feared
to
add
the
slightest
puff
to
the
wind
which
was
swaying
the
two
unfortunate
men
in
the
meantime
the
convict
had
succeeded
in
lowering
himself
to
a
position
near
the
sailor
it
was
high
time
one
minute
more
and
the
exhausted
and
despairing
man
would
have
allowed
himself
to
fall
into
the
abyss
the
convict
had
moored
him
securely
with
the
cord
to
which
he
clung
with
one
hand
while
he
was
working
with
the
other
at
last
he
was
seen
to
climb
back
on
the
yard
and
to
drag
the
sailor
up
after
him
he
held
him
there
a
moment
to
allow
him
to
recover
his
strength
then
he
grasped
him
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
walking
on
the
yard
himself
to
the
cap
and
from
there
to
the
main
top
where
he
left
him
in
the
hands
of
his
comrades
at
that
moment
the
crowd
broke
into
applause
old
convict
sergeants
among
them
wept
and
women
embraced
each
other
on
the
quay
and
all
voices
were
heard
to
cry
with
a
sort
of
tender
rage
pardon
for
that
man
he
in
the
meantime
had
immediately
begun
to
make
his
descent
to
rejoin
his
detachment
in
order
to
reach
them
the
more
speedily
he
dropped
into
the
rigging
and
ran
along
one
of
the
lower
yards
all
eyes
were
following
him
at
a
certain
moment
fear
assailed
them
whether
it
was
that
he
was
fatigued
or
that
his
head
turned
they
thought
they
saw
him
hesitate
and
stagger
all
at
once
the
crowd
uttered
a
loud
shout
the
convict
had
fallen
into
the
sea
the
fall
was
perilous
the
frigate
algesiras
was
anchored
alongside
the
orion
and
the
poor
convict
had
fallen
between
the
two
vessels
it
was
to
be
feared
that
he
would
slip
under
one
or
the
other
of
them
four
men
flung
themselves
hastily
into
a
boat
the
crowd
cheered
them
on
anxiety
again
took
possession
of
all
souls
the
man
had
not
risen
to
the
surface
he
had
disappeared
in
the
sea
without
leaving
a
ripple
as
though
he
had
fallen
into
a
cask
of
oil
they
sounded
they
dived
in
vain
the
search
was
continued
until
the
evening
they
did
not
even
find
the
body
on
the
following
day
the
toulon
newspaper
printed
these
lines
nov

yesterday
a
convict
belonging
to
the
detachment
on
board
of
the
orion
on
his
return
from
rendering
assistance
to
a
sailor
fell
into
the
sea
and
was
drowned
the
body
has
not
yet
been
found
it
is
supposed
that
it
is
entangled
among
the
piles
of

was
committed

the
water
question
at
montfermeil
montfermeil
is
situated
between
livry
and
chelles
on
the
southern
edge
of
that
lofty
table
land
which
separates
the
ourcq
from
the
marne
at
the
present
day
it
is
a
tolerably
large
town
ornamented
all
the
year
through
with
plaster
villas
and
on
sundays
with
beaming
bourgeois
in
1823
there
were
at
montfermeil
neither
so
many
white
houses
nor
so
many
well
satisfied
citizens
it
was
only
a
village
in
the
forest
some
pleasure
houses
of
the
last
century
were
to
be
met
with
there
to
be
sure
which
were
recognizable
by
their
grand
air
their
balconies
in
twisted
iron
and
their
long
windows
whose
tiny
panes
cast
all
sorts
of
varying
shades
of
green
on
the
white
of
the
closed
shutters
but
montfermeil
was
none
the
less
a
village
retired
cloth
merchants
and
rusticating
attorneys
had
not
discovered
it
as
yet
it
was
a
peaceful
and
charming
place
which
was
not
on
the
road
to
anywhere
there
people
lived
and
cheaply
that
peasant
rustic
life
which
is
so
bounteous
and
so
easy
only
water
was
rare
there
on
account
of
the
elevation
of
the
plateau
it
was
necessary
to
fetch
it
from
a
considerable
distance
the
end
of
the
village
towards
gagny
drew
its
water
from
the
magnificent
ponds
which
exist
in
the
woods
there
the
other
end
which
surrounds
the
church
and
which
lies
in
the
direction
of
chelles
found
drinking
water
only
at
a
little
spring
half
way
down
the
slope
near
the
road
to
chelles
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
montfermeil
thus
each
household
found
it
hard
work
to
keep
supplied
with
water
the
large
houses
the
aristocracy
of
which
the
thenardier
tavern
formed
a
part
paid
half
a
farthing
a
bucketful
to
a
man
who
made
a
business
of
it
and
who
earned
about
eight
sous
a
day
in
his
enterprise
of
supplying
montfermeil
with
water
but
this
good
man
only
worked
until
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
in
summer
and
five
in
winter
and
night
once
come
and
the
shutters
on
the
ground
floor
once
closed
he
who
had
no
water
to
drink
went
to
fetch
it
for
himself
or
did
without
it
this
constituted
the
terror
of
the
poor
creature
whom
the
reader
has
probably
not
forgotten
little
cosette
it
will
be
remembered
that
cosette
was
useful
to
the
thenardiers
in
two
ways
they
made
the
mother
pay
them
and
they
made
the
child
serve
them
so
when
the
mother
ceased
to
pay
altogether
the
reason
for
which
we
have
read
in
preceding
chapters
the
thenardiers
kept
cosette
she
took
the
place
of
a
servant
in
their
house
in
this
capacity
she
it
was
who
ran
to
fetch
water
when
it
was
required
so
the
child
who
was
greatly
terrified
at
the
idea
of
going
to
the
spring
at
night
took
great
care
that
water
should
never
be
lacking
in
the
house
christmas
of
the
year
1823
was
particularly
brilliant
at
montfermeil
the
beginning
of
the
winter
had
been
mild
there
had
been
neither
snow
nor
frost
up
to
that
time
some
mountebanks
from
paris
had
obtained
permission
of
the
mayor
to
erect
their
booths
in
the
principal
street
of
the
village
and
a
band
of
itinerant
merchants
under
protection
of
the
same
tolerance
had
constructed
their
stalls
on
the
church
square
and
even
extended
them
into
boulanger
alley
where
as
the
reader
will
perhaps
remember
the
thenardiers
hostelry
was
situated
these
people
filled
the
inns
and
drinking
shops
and
communicated
to
that
tranquil
little
district
a
noisy
and
joyous
life
in
order
to
play
the
part
of
a
faithful
historian
we
ought
even
to
add
that
among
the
curiosities
displayed
in
the
square
there
was
a
menagerie
in
which
frightful
clowns
clad
in
rags
and
coming
no
one
knew
whence
exhibited
to
the
peasants
of
montfermeil
in
1823
one
of
those
horrible
brazilian
vultures
such
as
our
royal
museum
did
not
possess
until
1845
and
which
have
a
tricolored
cockade
for
an
eye
i
believe
that
naturalists
call
this
bird
caracara
polyborus
it
belongs
to
the
order
of
the
apicides
and
to
the
family
of
the
vultures
some
good
old
bonapartist
soldiers
who
had
retired
to
the
village
went
to
see
this
creature
with
great
devotion
the
mountebanks
gave
out
that
the
tricolored
cockade
was
a
unique
phenomenon
made
by
god
expressly
for
their
menagerie
on
christmas
eve
itself
a
number
of
men
carters
and
peddlers
were
seated
at
table
drinking
and
smoking
around
four
or
five
candles
in
the
public
room
of
thenardier
s
hostelry
this
room
resembled
all
drinking
shop
rooms
tables
pewter
jugs
bottles
drinkers
smokers
but
little
light
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
the
date
of
the
year
1823
was
indicated
nevertheless
by
two
objects
which
were
then
fashionable
in
the
bourgeois
class
to
wit
a
kaleidoscope
and
a
lamp
of
ribbed
tin
the
female
thenardier
was
attending
to
the
supper
which
was
roasting
in
front
of
a
clear
fire
her
husband
was
drinking
with
his
customers
and
talking
politics
besides
political
conversations
which
had
for
their
principal
subjects
the
spanish
war
and
m
le
duc
d
angouleme
strictly
local
parentheses
like
the
following
were
audible
amid
the
uproar
about
nanterre
and
suresnes
the
vines
have
flourished
greatly
when
ten
pieces
were
reckoned
on
there
have
been
twelve
they
have
yielded
a
great
deal
of
juice
under
the
press
but
the
grapes
cannot
be
ripe
in
those
parts
the
grapes
should
not
be
ripe
the
wine
turns
oily
as
soon
as
spring
comes
then
it
is
very
thin
wine
there
are
wines
poorer
even
than
these
the
grapes
must
be
gathered
while
green
etc
or
a
miller
would
call
out
are
we
responsible
for
what
is
in
the
sacks
we
find
in
them
a
quantity
of
small
seed
which
we
cannot
sift
out
and
which
we
are
obliged
to
send
through
the
mill
stones
there
are
tares
fennel
vetches
hempseed
fox
tail
and
a
host
of
other
weeds
not
to
mention
pebbles
which
abound
in
certain
wheat
especially
in
breton
wheat
i
am
not
fond
of
grinding
breton
wheat
any
more
than
long
sawyers
like
to
saw
beams
with
nails
in
them
you
can
judge
of
the
bad
dust
that
makes
in
grinding
and
then
people
complain
of
the
flour
they
are
in
the
wrong
the
flour
is
no
fault
of
ours
in
a
space
between
two
windows
a
mower
who
was
seated
at
table
with
a
landed
proprietor
who
was
fixing
on
a
price
for
some
meadow
work
to
be
performed
in
the
spring
was
saying
it
does
no
harm
to
have
the
grass
wet
it
cuts
better
dew
is
a
good
thing
sir
it
makes
no
difference
with
that
grass
your
grass
is
young
and
very
hard
to
cut
still
it
s
terribly
tender
it
yields
before
the
iron
etc
cosette
was
in
her
usual
place
seated
on
the
cross
bar
of
the
kitchen
table
near
the
chimney
she
was
in
rags
her
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
wooden
shoes
and
by
the
firelight
she
was
engaged
in
knitting
woollen
stockings
destined
for
the
young
thenardiers
a
very
young
kitten
was
playing
about
among
the
chairs
laughter
and
chatter
were
audible
in
the
adjoining
room
from
two
fresh
children
s
voices
it
was
eponine
and
azelma
in
the
chimney
corner
a
cat
o
nine
tails
was
hanging
on
a
nail
at
intervals
the
cry
of
a
very
young
child
which
was
somewhere
in
the
house
rang
through
the
noise
of
the
dram
shop
it
was
a
little
boy
who
had
been
born
to
the
thenardiers
during
one
of
the
preceding
winters
she
did
not
know
why
she
said
the
result
of
the
cold
and
who
was
a
little
more
than
three
years
old
the
mother
had
nursed
him
but
she
did
not
love
him
when
the
persistent
clamor
of
the
brat
became
too
annoying
your
son
is
squalling
thenardier
would
say
do
go
and
see
what
he
wants
bah
the
mother
would
reply
he
bothers
me
and
the
neglected
child
continued
to
shriek
in
the
dark
chapter
ii
two
complete
portraits
so
far
in
this
book
the
thenardiers
have
been
viewed
only
in
profile
the
moment
has
arrived
for
making
the
circuit
of
this
couple
and
considering
it
under
all
its
aspects
thenardier
had
just
passed
his
fiftieth
birthday
madame
thenardier
was
approaching
her
forties
which
is
equivalent
to
fifty
in
a
woman
so
that
there
existed
a
balance
of
age
between
husband
and
wife
our
readers
have
possibly
preserved
some
recollection
of
this
thenardier
woman
ever
since
her
first
appearance
tall
blond
red
fat
angular
square
enormous
and
agile
she
belonged
as
we
have
said
to
the
race
of
those
colossal
wild
women
who
contort
themselves
at
fairs
with
paving
stones
hanging
from
their
hair
she
did
everything
about
the
house
made
the
beds
did
the
washing
the
cooking
and
everything
else
cosette
was
her
only
servant
a
mouse
in
the
service
of
an
elephant
everything
trembled
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
window
panes
furniture
and
people
her
big
face
dotted
with
red
blotches
presented
the
appearance
of
a
skimmer
she
had
a
beard
she
was
an
ideal
market
porter
dressed
in
woman
s
clothes
she
swore
splendidly
she
boasted
of
being
able
to
crack
a
nut
with
one
blow
of
her
fist
except
for
the
romances
which
she
had
read
and
which
made
the
affected
lady
peep
through
the
ogress
at
times
in
a
very
queer
way
the
idea
would
never
have
occurred
to
any
one
to
say
of
her
that
is
a
woman
this
thenardier
female
was
like
the
product
of
a
wench
engrafted
on
a
fishwife
when
one
heard
her
speak
one
said
that
is
a
gendarme
when
one
saw
her
drink
one
said
that
is
a
carter
when
one
saw
her
handle
cosette
one
said
that
is
the
hangman
one
of
her
teeth
projected
when
her
face
was
in
repose
thenardier
was
a
small
thin
pale
angular
bony
feeble
man
who
had
a
sickly
air
and
who
was
wonderfully
healthy
his
cunning
began
here
he
smiled
habitually
by
way
of
precaution
and
was
almost
polite
to
everybody
even
to
the
beggar
to
whom
he
refused
half
a
farthing
he
had
the
glance
of
a
pole
cat
and
the
bearing
of
a
man
of
letters
he
greatly
resembled
the
portraits
of
the
abbe
delille
his
coquetry
consisted
in
drinking
with
the
carters
no
one
had
ever
succeeded
in
rendering
him
drunk
he
smoked
a
big
pipe
he
wore
a
blouse
and
under
his
blouse
an
old
black
coat
he
made
pretensions
to
literature
and
to
materialism
there
were
certain
names
which
he
often
pronounced
to
support
whatever
things
he
might
be
saying
voltaire
raynal
parny
and
singularly
enough
saint
augustine
he
declared
that
he
had
a
system
in
addition
he
was
a
great
swindler
a
filousophe
philosophe
a
scientific
thief
the
species
does
exist
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
pretended
to
have
served
in
the
army
he
was
in
the
habit
of
relating
with
exuberance
how
being
a
sergeant
in
the
6th
or
the
9th
light
something
or
other
at
waterloo
he
had
alone
and
in
the
presence
of
a
squadron
of
death
dealing
hussars
covered
with
his
body
and
saved
from
death
in
the
midst
of
the
grape
shot
a
general
who
had
been
dangerously
wounded
thence
arose
for
his
wall
the
flaring
sign
and
for
his
inn
the
name
which
it
bore
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
cabaret
of
the
sergeant
of
waterloo
he
was
a
liberal
a
classic
and
a
bonapartist
he
had
subscribed
for
the
champ
d
asile
it
was
said
in
the
village
that
he
had
studied
for
the
priesthood
we
believe
that
he
had
simply
studied
in
holland
for
an
inn
keeper
this
rascal
of
composite
order
was
in
all
probability
some
fleming
from
lille
in
flanders
a
frenchman
in
paris
a
belgian
at
brussels
being
comfortably
astride
of
both
frontiers
as
for
his
prowess
at
waterloo
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
with
that
it
will
be
perceived
that
he
exaggerated
it
a
trifle
ebb
and
flow
wandering
adventure
was
the
leven
of
his
existence
a
tattered
conscience
entails
a
fragmentary
life
and
apparently
at
the
stormy
epoch
of
june
18
1815
thenardier
belonged
to
that
variety
of
marauding
sutlers
of
which
we
have
spoken
beating
about
the
country
selling
to
some
stealing
from
others
and
travelling
like
a
family
man
with
wife
and
children
in
a
rickety
cart
in
the
rear
of
troops
on
the
march
with
an
instinct
for
always
attaching
himself
to
the
victorious
army
this
campaign
ended
and
having
as
he
said
some
quibus
he
had
come
to
montfermeil
and
set
up
an
inn
there
this
quibus
composed
of
purses
and
watches
of
gold
rings
and
silver
crosses
gathered
in
harvest
time
in
furrows
sown
with
corpses
did
not
amount
to
a
large
total
and
did
not
carry
this
sutler
turned
eating
house
keeper
very
far
thenardier
had
that
peculiar
rectilinear
something
about
his
gestures
which
accompanied
by
an
oath
recalls
the
barracks
and
by
a
sign
of
the
cross
the
seminary
he
was
a
fine
talker
he
allowed
it
to
be
thought
that
he
was
an
educated
man
nevertheless
the
schoolmaster
had
noticed
that
he
pronounced
improperly
12
he
composed
the
travellers
tariff
card
in
a
superior
manner
but
practised
eyes
sometimes
spied
out
orthographical
errors
in
it
thenardier
was
cunning
greedy
slothful
and
clever
he
did
not
disdain
his
servants
which
caused
his
wife
to
dispense
with
them
this
giantess
was
jealous
it
seemed
to
her
that
that
thin
and
yellow
little
man
must
be
an
object
coveted
by
all
thenardier
who
was
above
all
an
astute
and
well
balanced
man
was
a
scamp
of
a
temperate
sort
this
is
the
worst
species
hypocrisy
enters
into
it
it
is
not
that
thenardier
was
not
on
occasion
capable
of
wrath
to
quite
the
same
degree
as
his
wife
but
this
was
very
rare
and
at
such
times
since
he
was
enraged
with
the
human
race
in
general
as
he
bore
within
him
a
deep
furnace
of
hatred
and
since
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
continually
avenging
their
wrongs
who
accuse
everything
that
passes
before
them
of
everything
which
has
befallen
them
and
who
are
always
ready
to
cast
upon
the
first
person
who
comes
to
hand
as
a
legitimate
grievance
the
sum
total
of
the
deceptions
the
bankruptcies
and
the
calamities
of
their
lives
when
all
this
leaven
was
stirred
up
in
him
and
boiled
forth
from
his
mouth
and
eyes
he
was
terrible
woe
to
the
person
who
came
under
his
wrath
at
such
a
time
in
addition
to
his
other
qualities
thenardier
was
attentive
and
penetrating
silent
or
talkative
according
to
circumstances
and
always
highly
intelligent
he
had
something
of
the
look
of
sailors
who
are
accustomed
to
screw
up
their
eyes
to
gaze
through
marine
glasses
thenardier
was
a
statesman
every
new
comer
who
entered
the
tavern
said
on
catching
sight
of
madame
thenardier
there
is
the
master
of
the
house
a
mistake
she
was
not
even
the
mistress
the
husband
was
both
master
and
mistress
she
worked
he
created
he
directed
everything
by
a
sort
of
invisible
and
constant
magnetic
action
a
word
was
sufficient
for
him
sometimes
a
sign
the
mastodon
obeyed
thenardier
was
a
sort
of
special
and
sovereign
being
in
madame
thenardier
s
eyes
though
she
did
not
thoroughly
realize
it
she
was
possessed
of
virtues
after
her
own
kind
if
she
had
ever
had
a
disagreement
as
to
any
detail
with
monsieur
thenardier
which
was
an
inadmissible
hypothesis
by
the
way
she
would
not
have
blamed
her
husband
in
public
on
any
subject
whatever
she
would
never
have
committed
before
strangers
that
mistake
so
often
committed
by
women
and
which
is
called
in
parliamentary
language
exposing
the
crown
although
their
concord
had
only
evil
as
its
result
there
was
contemplation
in
madame
thenardier
s
submission
to
her
husband
that
mountain
of
noise
and
of
flesh
moved
under
the
little
finger
of
that
frail
despot
viewed
on
its
dwarfed
and
grotesque
side
this
was
that
grand
and
universal
thing
the
adoration
of
mind
by
matter
for
certain
ugly
features
have
a
cause
in
the
very
depths
of
eternal
beauty
there
was
an
unknown
quantity
about
thenardier
hence
the
absolute
empire
of
the
man
over
that
woman
at
certain
moments
she
beheld
him
like
a
lighted
candle
at
others
she
felt
him
like
a
claw
this
woman
was
a
formidable
creature
who
loved
no
one
except
her
children
and
who
did
not
fear
any
one
except
her
husband
she
was
a
mother
because
she
was
mammiferous
but
her
maternity
stopped
short
with
her
daughters
and
as
we
shall
see
did
not
extend
to
boys
the
man
had
but
one
thought
how
to
enrich
himself
he
did
not
succeed
in
this
a
theatre
worthy
of
this
great
talent
was
lacking
thenardier
was
ruining
himself
at
montfermeil
if
ruin
is
possible
to
zero
in
switzerland
or
in
the
pyrenees
this
penniless
scamp
would
have
become
a
millionaire
but
an
inn
keeper
must
browse
where
fate
has
hitched
him
it
will
be
understood
that
the
word
inn
keeper
is
here
employed
in
a
restricted
sense
and
does
not
extend
to
an
entire
class
in
this
same
year
1823
thenardier
was
burdened
with
about
fifteen
hundred
francs
worth
of
petty
debts
and
this
rendered
him
anxious
whatever
may
have
been
the
obstinate
injustice
of
destiny
in
this
case
thenardier
was
one
of
those
men
who
understand
best
with
the
most
profundity
and
in
the
most
modern
fashion
that
thing
which
is
a
virtue
among
barbarous
peoples
and
an
object
of
merchandise
among
civilized
peoples
hospitality
besides
he
was
an
admirable
poacher
and
quoted
for
his
skill
in
shooting
he
had
a
certain
cold
and
tranquil
laugh
which
was
particularly
dangerous
his
theories
as
a
landlord
sometimes
burst
forth
in
lightning
flashes
he
had
professional
aphorisms
which
he
inserted
into
his
wife
s
mind
the
duty
of
the
inn
keeper
he
said
to
her
one
day
violently
and
in
a
low
voice
is
to
sell
to
the
first
comer
stews
repose
light
fire
dirty
sheets
a
servant
lice
and
a
smile
to
stop
passers
by
to
empty
small
purses
and
to
honestly
lighten
heavy
ones
to
shelter
travelling
families
respectfully
to
shave
the

the

the

the
ottoman
the

the
feather

the

and
the
truss
of
straw
to
know
how
much
the
shadow
uses
up
the
mirror
and
to
put
a
price
on
it
and
by
five
hundred
thousand
devils
to
make
the
traveller
pay
for
everything
even
for
the
flies
which
his
dog
eats
this
man
and
this
woman
were
ruse
and
rage
wedded
a
hideous
and
terrible
team
while
the
husband
pondered
and
combined
madame
thenardier
thought
not
of
absent
creditors
took
no
heed
of
yesterday
nor
of
to
morrow
and
lived
in
a
fit
of
anger
all
in
a
minute
such
were
these
two
beings
cosette
was
between
them
subjected
to
their
double
pressure
like
a
creature
who
is
at
the
same
time
being
ground
up
in
a
mill
and
pulled
to
pieces
with
pincers
the
man
and
the
woman
each
had
a
different
method
cosette
was
overwhelmed
with
blows
this
was
the
woman
s
she
went
barefooted
in
winter
that
was
the
man
s
doing
cosette
ran
up
stairs
and
down
washed
swept
rubbed
dusted
ran
fluttered
about
panted
moved
heavy
articles
and
weak
as
she
was
did
the
coarse
work
there
was
no
mercy
for
her
a
fierce
mistress
and
venomous
master
the
thenardier
hostelry
was
like
a
spider
s
web
in
which
cosette
had
been
caught
and
where
she
lay
trembling
the
ideal
of
oppression
was
realized
by
this
sinister
household
it
was
something
like
the
fly
serving
the
spiders
the
poor
child
passively
held
her
peace
what
takes
place
within
these
souls
when
they
have
but
just
quitted
god
find
themselves
thus
at
the
very
dawn
of
life
very
small
and
in
the
midst
of
men
all
naked
chapter
iii
men
must
have
wine
and
horses
must
have
water
four
new
travellers
had
arrived
cosette
was
meditating
sadly
for
although
she
was
only
eight
years
old
she
had
already
suffered
so
much
that
she
reflected
with
the
lugubrious
air
of
an
old
woman
her
eye
was
black
in
consequence
of
a
blow
from
madame
thenardier
s
fist
which
caused
the
latter
to
remark
from
time
to
time
how
ugly
she
is
with
her
fist
blow
on
her
eye
cosette
was
thinking
that
it
was
dark
very
dark
that
the
pitchers
and
caraffes
in
the
chambers
of
the
travellers
who
had
arrived
must
have
been
filled
and
that
there
was
no
more
water
in
the
cistern
she
was
somewhat
reassured
because
no
one
in
the
thenardier
establishment
drank
much
water
thirsty
people
were
never
lacking
there
but
their
thirst
was
of
the
sort
which
applies
to
the
jug
rather
than
to
the
pitcher
any
one
who
had
asked
for
a
glass
of
water
among
all
those
glasses
of
wine
would
have
appeared
a
savage
to
all
these
men
but
there
came
a
moment
when
the
child
trembled
madame
thenardier
raised
the
cover
of
a
stew
pan
which
was
boiling
on
the
stove
then
seized
a
glass
and
briskly
approached
the
cistern
she
turned
the
faucet
the
child
had
raised
her
head
and
was
following
all
the
woman
s
movements
a
thin
stream
of
water
trickled
from
the
faucet
and
half
filled
the
glass
well
said
she
there
is
no
more
water
a
momentary
silence
ensued
the
child
did
not
breathe
bah
resumed
madame
thenardier
examining
the
half
filled
glass
this
will
be
enough
cosette
applied
herself
to
her
work
once
more
but
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
felt
her
heart
leaping
in
her
bosom
like
a
big
snow
flake
she
counted
the
minutes
that
passed
in
this
manner
and
wished
it
were
the
next
morning
from
time
to
time
one
of
the
drinkers
looked
into
the
street
and
exclaimed
it
s
as
black
as
an
oven
or
one
must
needs
be
a
cat
to
go
about
the
streets
without
a
lantern
at
this
hour
and
cosette
trembled
all
at
once
one
of
the
pedlers
who
lodged
in
the
hostelry
entered
and
said
in
a
harsh
voice
my
horse
has
not
been
watered
yes
it
has
said
madame
thenardier
i
tell
you
that
it
has
not
retorted
the
pedler
cosette
had
emerged
from
under
the
table
oh
yes
sir
said
she
the
horse
has
had
a
drink
he
drank
out
of
a
bucket
a
whole
bucketful
and
it
was
i
who
took
the
water
to
him
and
i
spoke
to
him
it
was
not
true
cosette
lied
there
s
a
brat
as
big
as
my
fist
who
tells
lies
as
big
as
the
house
exclaimed
the
pedler
i
tell
you
that
he
has
not
been
watered
you
little
jade
he
has
a
way
of
blowing
when
he
has
had
no
water
which
i
know
well
cosette
persisted
and
added
in
a
voice
rendered
hoarse
with
anguish
and
which
was
hardly
audible
and
he
drank
heartily
come
said
the
pedler
in
a
rage
this
won
t
do
at
all
let
my
horse
be
watered
and
let
that
be
the
end
of
it
cosette
crept
under
the
table
again
in
truth
that
is
fair
said
madame
thenardier
if
the
beast
has
not
been
watered
it
must
be
then
glancing
about
her
well
now
where
s
that
other
beast
she
bent
down
and
discovered
cosette
cowering
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
almost
under
the
drinkers
feet
are
you
coming
shrieked
madame
thenardier
cosette
crawled
out
of
the
sort
of
hole
in
which
she
had
hidden
herself
the
thenardier
resumed
mademoiselle
dog
lack
name
go
and
water
that
horse
but
madame
said
cosette
feebly
there
is
no
water
the
thenardier
threw
the
street
door
wide
open
well
go
and
get
some
then
cosette
dropped
her
head
and
went
for
an
empty
bucket
which
stood
near
the
chimney
corner
this
bucket
was
bigger
than
she
was
and
the
child
could
have
set
down
in
it
at
her
ease
the
thenardier
returned
to
her
stove
and
tasted
what
was
in
the
stewpan
with
a
wooden
spoon
grumbling
the
while
there
s
plenty
in
the
spring
there
never
was
such
a
malicious
creature
as
that
i
think
i
should
have
done
better
to
strain
my
onions
then
she
rummaged
in
a
drawer
which
contained
sous
pepper
and
shallots
see
here
mam
selle
toad
she
added
on
your
way
back
you
will
get
a
big
loaf
from
the
baker
here
s
a
fifteen
sou
piece
cosette
had
a
little
pocket
on
one
side
of
her
apron
she
took
the
coin
without
saying
a
word
and
put
it
in
that
pocket
then
she
stood
motionless
bucket
in
hand
the
open
door
before
her
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
one
to
come
to
her
rescue
get
along
with
you
screamed
the
thenardier
cosette
went
out
the
door
closed
behind
her
chapter
iv
entrance
on
the
scene
of
a
doll
the
line
of
open
air
booths
starting
at
the
church
extended
as
the
reader
will
remember
as
far
as
the
hostelry
of
the
thenardiers
these
booths
were
all
illuminated
because
the
citizens
would
soon
pass
on
their
way
to
the
midnight
mass
with
candles
burning
in
paper
funnels
which
as
the
schoolmaster
then
seated
at
the
table
at
the
thenardiers
observed
produced
a
magical
effect
in
compensation
not
a
star
was
visible
in
the
sky
the
last
of
these
stalls
established
precisely
opposite
the
thenardiers
door
was
a
toy
shop
all
glittering
with
tinsel
glass
and
magnificent
objects
of
tin
in
the
first
row
and
far
forwards
the
merchant
had
placed
on
a
background
of
white
napkins
an
immense
doll
nearly
two
feet
high
who
was
dressed
in
a
robe
of
pink
crepe
with
gold
wheat
ears
on
her
head
which
had
real
hair
and
enamel
eyes
all
that
day
this
marvel
had
been
displayed
to
the
wonderment
of
all
passers
by
under
ten
years
of
age
without
a
mother
being
found
in
montfermeil
sufficiently
rich
or
sufficiently
extravagant
to
give
it
to
her
child
eponine
and
azelma
had
passed
hours
in
contemplating
it
and
cosette
herself
had
ventured
to
cast
a
glance
at
it
on
the
sly
it
is
true
at
the
moment
when
cosette
emerged
bucket
in
hand
melancholy
and
overcome
as
she
was
she
could
not
refrain
from
lifting
her
eyes
to
that
wonderful
doll
towards
the
lady
as
she
called
it
the
poor
child
paused
in
amazement
she
had
not
yet
beheld
that
doll
close
to
the
whole
shop
seemed
a
palace
to
her
the
doll
was
not
a
doll
it
was
a
vision
it
was
joy
splendor
riches
happiness
which
appeared
in
a
sort
of
chimerical
halo
to
that
unhappy
little
being
so
profoundly
engulfed
in
gloomy
and
chilly
misery
with
the
sad
and
innocent
sagacity
of
childhood
cosette
measured
the
abyss
which
separated
her
from
that
doll
she
said
to
herself
that
one
must
be
a
queen
or
at
least
a
princess
to
have
a
thing
like
that
she
gazed
at
that
beautiful
pink
dress
that
beautiful
smooth
hair
and
she
thought
how
happy
that
doll
must
be
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
that
fantastic
stall
the
more
she
looked
the
more
dazzled
she
grew
she
thought
she
was
gazing
at
paradise
there
were
other
dolls
behind
the
large
one
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
fairies
and
genii
the
merchant
who
was
pacing
back
and
forth
in
front
of
his
shop
produced
on
her
somewhat
the
effect
of
being
the
eternal
father
in
this
adoration
she
forgot
everything
even
the
errand
with
which
she
was
charged
all
at
once
the
thenardier
s
coarse
voice
recalled
her
to
reality
what
you
silly
jade
you
have
not
gone
wait
i
ll
give
it
to
you
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
doing
there
get
along
you
little
monster
the
thenardier
had
cast
a
glance
into
the
street
and
had
caught
sight
of
cosette
in
her
ecstasy
cosette
fled
dragging
her
pail
and
taking
the
longest
strides
of
which
she
was
capable
chapter
v
the
little
one
all
alone
as
the
thenardier
hostelry
was
in
that
part
of
the
village
which
is
near
the
church
it
was
to
the
spring
in
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
chelles
that
cosette
was
obliged
to
go
for
her
water
she
did
not
glance
at
the
display
of
a
single
other
merchant
so
long
as
she
was
in
boulanger
lane
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
church
the
lighted
stalls
illuminated
the
road
but
soon
the
last
light
from
the
last
stall
vanished
the
poor
child
found
herself
in
the
dark
she
plunged
into
it
only
as
a
certain
emotion
overcame
her
she
made
as
much
motion
as
possible
with
the
handle
of
the
bucket
as
she
walked
along
this
made
a
noise
which
afforded
her
company
the
further
she
went
the
denser
the
darkness
became
there
was
no
one
in
the
streets
however
she
did
encounter
a
woman
who
turned
around
on
seeing
her
and
stood
still
muttering
between
her
teeth
where
can
that
child
be
going
is
it
a
werewolf
child
then
the
woman
recognized
cosette
well
said
she
it
s
the
lark
in
this
manner
cosette
traversed
the
labyrinth
of
tortuous
and
deserted
streets
which
terminate
in
the
village
of
montfermeil
on
the
side
of
chelles
so
long
as
she
had
the
houses
or
even
the
walls
only
on
both
sides
of
her
path
she
proceeded
with
tolerable
boldness
from
time
to
time
she
caught
the
flicker
of
a
candle
through
the
crack
of
a
shutter
this
was
light
and
life
there
were
people
there
and
it
reassured
her
but
in
proportion
as
she
advanced
her
pace
slackened
mechanically
as
it
were
when
she
had
passed
the
corner
of
the
last
house
cosette
paused
it
had
been
hard
to
advance
further
than
the
last
stall
it
became
impossible
to
proceed
further
than
the
last
house
she
set
her
bucket
on
the
ground
thrust
her
hand
into
her
hair
and
began
slowly
to
scratch
her
head
a
gesture
peculiar
to
children
when
terrified
and
undecided
what
to
do
it
was
no
longer
montfermeil
it
was
the
open
fields
black
and
desert
space
was
before
her
she
gazed
in
despair
at
that
darkness
where
there
was
no
longer
any
one
where
there
were
beasts
where
there
were
spectres
possibly
she
took
a
good
look
and
heard
the
beasts
walking
on
the
grass
and
she
distinctly
saw
spectres
moving
in
the
trees
then
she
seized
her
bucket
again
fear
had
lent
her
audacity
bah
said
she
i
will
tell
him
that
there
was
no
more
water
and
she
resolutely
re
entered
montfermeil
hardly
had
she
gone
a
hundred
paces
when
she
paused
and
began
to
scratch
her
head
again
now
it
was
the
thenardier
who
appeared
to
her
with
her
hideous
hyena
mouth
and
wrath
flashing
in
her
eyes
the
child
cast
a
melancholy
glance
before
her
and
behind
her
what
was
she
to
do
what
was
to
become
of
her
where
was
she
to
go
in
front
of
her
was
the
spectre
of
the
thenardier
behind
her
all
the
phantoms
of
the
night
and
of
the
forest
it
was
before
the
thenardier
that
she
recoiled
she
resumed
her
path
to
the
spring
and
began
to
run
she
emerged
from
the
village
she
entered
the
forest
at
a
run
no
longer
looking
at
or
listening
to
anything
she
only
paused
in
her
course
when
her
breath
failed
her
but
she
did
not
halt
in
her
advance
she
went
straight
before
her
in
desperation
as
she
ran
she
felt
like
crying
the
nocturnal
quivering
of
the
forest
surrounded
her
completely
she
no
longer
thought
she
no
longer
saw
the
immensity
of
night
was
facing
this
tiny
creature
on
the
one
hand
all
shadow
on
the
other
an
atom
it
was
only
seven
or
eight
minutes
walk
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
to
the
spring
cosette
knew
the
way
through
having
gone
over
it
many
times
in
daylight
strange
to
say
she
did
not
get
lost
a
remnant
of
instinct
guided
her
vaguely
but
she
did
not
turn
her
eyes
either
to
right
or
to
left
for
fear
of
seeing
things
in
the
branches
and
in
the
brushwood
in
this
manner
she
reached
the
spring
it
was
a
narrow
natural
basin
hollowed
out
by
the
water
in
a
clayey
soil
about
two
feet
deep
surrounded
with
moss
and
with
those
tall
crimped
grasses
which
are
called
henry
iv
s
frills
and
paved
with
several
large
stones
a
brook
ran
out
of
it
with
a
tranquil
little
noise
cosette
did
not
take
time
to
breathe
it
was
very
dark
but
she
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
this
spring
she
felt
with
her
left
hand
in
the
dark
for
a
young
oak
which
leaned
over
the
spring
and
which
usually
served
to
support
her
found
one
of
its
branches
clung
to
it
bent
down
and
plunged
the
bucket
in
the
water
she
was
in
a
state
of
such
violent
excitement
that
her
strength
was
trebled
while
thus
bent
over
she
did
not
notice
that
the
pocket
of
her
apron
had
emptied
itself
into
the
spring
the
fifteen
sou
piece
fell
into
the
water
cosette
neither
saw
nor
heard
it
fall
she
drew
out
the
bucket
nearly
full
and
set
it
on
the
grass
that
done
she
perceived
that
she
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
she
would
have
liked
to
set
out
again
at
once
but
the
effort
required
to
fill
the
bucket
had
been
such
that
she
found
it
impossible
to
take
a
step
she
was
forced
to
sit
down
she
dropped
on
the
grass
and
remained
crouching
there
she
shut
her
eyes
then
she
opened
them
again
without
knowing
why
but
because
she
could
not
do
otherwise
the
agitated
water
in
the
bucket
beside
her
was
describing
circles
which
resembled
tin
serpents
overhead
the
sky
was
covered
with
vast
black
clouds
which
were
like
masses
of
smoke
the
tragic
mask
of
shadow
seemed
to
bend
vaguely
over
the
child
jupiter
was
setting
in
the
depths
the
child
stared
with
bewildered
eyes
at
this
great
star
with
which
she
was
unfamiliar
and
which
terrified
her
the
planet
was
in
fact
very
near
the
horizon
and
was
traversing
a
dense
layer
of
mist
which
imparted
to
it
a
horrible
ruddy
hue
the
mist
gloomily
empurpled
magnified
the
star
one
would
have
called
it
a
luminous
wound
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
from
the
plain
the
forest
was
dark
not
a
leaf
was
moving
there
were
none
of
the
vague
fresh
gleams
of
summertide
great
boughs
uplifted
themselves
in
frightful
wise
slender
and
misshapen
bushes
whistled
in
the
clearings
the
tall
grasses
undulated
like
eels
under
the
north
wind
the
nettles
seemed
to
twist
long
arms
furnished
with
claws
in
search
of
prey
some
bits
of
dry
heather
tossed
by
the
breeze
flew
rapidly
by
and
had
the
air
of
fleeing
in
terror
before
something
which
was
coming
after
on
all
sides
there
were
lugubrious
stretches
the
darkness
was
bewildering
man
requires
light
whoever
buries
himself
in
the
opposite
of
day
feels
his
heart
contract
when
the
eye
sees
black
the
heart
sees
trouble
in
an
eclipse
in
the
night
in
the
sooty
opacity
there
is
anxiety
even
for
the
stoutest
of
hearts
no
one
walks
alone
in
the
forest
at
night
without
trembling
shadows
and
trees
two
formidable
densities
a
chimerical
reality
appears
in
the
indistinct
depths
the
inconceivable
is
outlined
a
few
paces
distant
from
you
with
a
spectral
clearness
one
beholds
floating
either
in
space
or
in
one
s
own
brain
one
knows
not
what
vague
and
intangible
thing
like
the
dreams
of
sleeping
flowers
there
are
fierce
attitudes
on
the
horizon
one
inhales
the
effluvia
of
the
great
black
void
one
is
afraid
to
glance
behind
him
yet
desirous
of
doing
so
the
cavities
of
night
things
grown
haggard
taciturn
profiles
which
vanish
when
one
advances
obscure
dishevelments
irritated
tufts
livid
pools
the
lugubrious
reflected
in
the
funereal
the
sepulchral
immensity
of
silence
unknown
but
possible
beings
bendings
of
mysterious
branches
alarming
torsos
of
trees
long
handfuls
of
quivering
plants
against
all
this
one
has
no
protection
there
is
no
hardihood
which
does
not
shudder
and
which
does
not
feel
the
vicinity
of
anguish
one
is
conscious
of
something
hideous
as
though
one
s
soul
were
becoming
amalgamated
with
the
darkness
this
penetration
of
the
shadows
is
indescribably
sinister
in
the
case
of
a
child
forests
are
apocalypses
and
the
beating
of
the
wings
of
a
tiny
soul
produces
a
sound
of
agony
beneath
their
monstrous
vault
without
understanding
her
sensations
cosette
was
conscious
that
she
was
seized
upon
by
that
black
enormity
of
nature
it
was
no
longer
terror
alone
which
was
gaining
possession
of
her
it
was
something
more
terrible
even
than
terror
she
shivered
there
are
no
words
to
express
the
strangeness
of
that
shiver
which
chilled
her
to
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
her
eye
grew
wild
she
thought
she
felt
that
she
should
not
be
able
to
refrain
from
returning
there
at
the
same
hour
on
the
morrow
then
by
a
sort
of
instinct
she
began
to
count
aloud
one
two
three
four
and
so
on
up
to
ten
in
order
to
escape
from
that
singular
state
which
she
did
not
understand
but
which
terrified
her
and
when
she
had
finished
she
began
again
this
restored
her
to
a
true
perception
of
the
things
about
her
her
hands
which
she
had
wet
in
drawing
the
water
felt
cold
she
rose
her
terror
a
natural
and
unconquerable
terror
had
returned
she
had
but
one
thought
now
to
flee
at
full
speed
through
the
forest
across
the
fields
to
the
houses
to
the
windows
to
the
lighted
candles
her
glance
fell
upon
the
water
which
stood
before
her
such
was
the
fright
which
the
thenardier
inspired
in
her
that
she
dared
not
flee
without
that
bucket
of
water
she
seized
the
handle
with
both
hands
she
could
hardly
lift
the
pail
in
this
manner
she
advanced
a
dozen
paces
but
the
bucket
was
full
it
was
heavy
she
was
forced
to
set
it
on
the
ground
once
more
she
took
breath
for
an
instant
then
lifted
the
handle
of
the
bucket
again
and
resumed
her
march
proceeding
a
little
further
this
time
but
again
she
was
obliged
to
pause
after
some
seconds
of
repose
she
set
out
again
she
walked
bent
forward
with
drooping
head
like
an
old
woman
the
weight
of
the
bucket
strained
and
stiffened
her
thin
arms
the
iron
handle
completed
the
benumbing
and
freezing
of
her
wet
and
tiny
hands
she
was
forced
to
halt
from
time
to
time
and
each
time
that
she
did
so
the
cold
water
which
splashed
from
the
pail
fell
on
her
bare
legs
this
took
place
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
at
night
in
winter
far
from
all
human
sight
she
was
a
child
of
eight
no
one
but
god
saw
that
sad
thing
at
the
moment
and
her
mother
no
doubt
alas
for
there
are
things
that
make
the
dead
open
their
eyes
in
their
graves
she
panted
with
a
sort
of
painful
rattle
sobs
contracted
her
throat
but
she
dared
not
weep
so
afraid
was
she
of
the
thenardier
even
at
a
distance
it
was
her
custom
to
imagine
the
thenardier
always
present
however
she
could
not
make
much
headway
in
that
manner
and
she
went
on
very
slowly
in
spite
of
diminishing
the
length
of
her
stops
and
of
walking
as
long
as
possible
between
them
she
reflected
with
anguish
that
it
would
take
her
more
than
an
hour
to
return
to
montfermeil
in
this
manner
and
that
the
thenardier
would
beat
her
this
anguish
was
mingled
with
her
terror
at
being
alone
in
the
woods
at
night
she
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
had
not
yet
emerged
from
the
forest
on
arriving
near
an
old
chestnut
tree
with
which
she
was
acquainted
made
a
last
halt
longer
than
the
rest
in
order
that
she
might
get
well
rested
then
she
summoned
up
all
her
strength
picked
up
her
bucket
again
and
courageously
resumed
her
march
but
the
poor
little
desperate
creature
could
not
refrain
from
crying
o
my
god
my
god
at
that
moment
she
suddenly
became
conscious
that
her
bucket
no
longer
weighed
anything
at
all
a
hand
which
seemed
to
her
enormous
had
just
seized
the
handle
and
lifted
it
vigorously
she
raised
her
head
a
large
black
form
straight
and
erect
was
walking
beside
her
through
the
darkness
it
was
a
man
who
had
come
up
behind
her
and
whose
approach
she
had
not
heard
this
man
without
uttering
a
word
had
seized
the
handle
of
the
bucket
which
she
was
carrying
there
are
instincts
for
all
the
encounters
of
life
the
child
was
not
afraid
chapter

which
possibly
proves
boulatruelle
s
intelligence
on
the
afternoon
of
that
same
christmas
day
1823
a
man
had
walked
for
rather
a
long
time
in
the
most
deserted
part
of
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
in
paris
this
man
had
the
air
of
a
person
who
is
seeking
lodgings
and
he
seemed
to
halt
by
preference
at
the
most
modest
houses
on
that
dilapidated
border
of
the
faubourg
saint
marceau
we
shall
see
further
on
that
this
man
had
in
fact
hired
a
chamber
in
that
isolated
quarter
this
man
in
his
attire
as
in
all
his
person
realized
the
type
of
what
may
be
called
the
well
bred
mendicant
extreme
wretchedness
combined
with
extreme
cleanliness
this
is
a
very
rare
mixture
which
inspires
intelligent
hearts
with
that
double
respect
which
one
feels
for
the
man
who
is
very
poor
and
for
the
man
who
is
very
worthy
he
wore
a
very
old
and
very
well
brushed
round
hat
a
coarse
coat
worn
perfectly
threadbare
of
an
ochre
yellow
a
color
that
was
not
in
the
least
eccentric
at
that
epoch
a
large
waistcoat
with
pockets
of
a
venerable
cut
black
breeches
worn
gray
at
the
knee
stockings
of
black
worsted
and
thick
shoes
with
copper
buckles
he
would
have
been
pronounced
a
preceptor
in
some
good
family
returned
from
the
emigration
he
would
have
been
taken
for
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
from
his
perfectly
white
hair
his
wrinkled
brow
his
livid
lips
and
his
countenance
where
everything
breathed
depression
and
weariness
of
life
judging
from
his
firm
tread
from
the
singular
vigor
which
stamped
all
his
movements
he
would
have
hardly
been
thought
fifty
the
wrinkles
on
his
brow
were
well
placed
and
would
have
disposed
in
his
favor
any
one
who
observed
him
attentively
his
lip
contracted
with
a
strange
fold
which
seemed
severe
and
which
was
humble
there
was
in
the
depth
of
his
glance
an
indescribable
melancholy
serenity
in
his
left
hand
he
carried
a
little
bundle
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
in
his
right
he
leaned
on
a
sort
of
a
cudgel
cut
from
some
hedge
this
stick
had
been
carefully
trimmed
and
had
an
air
that
was
not
too
threatening
the
most
had
been
made
of
its
knots
and
it
had
received
a
coral
like
head
made
from
red
wax
it
was
a
cudgel
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
cane
there
are
but
few
passers
by
on
that
boulevard
particularly
in
the
winter
the
man
seemed
to
avoid
them
rather
than
to
seek
them
but
this
without
any
affectation
at
that
epoch
king
louis
xviii
went
nearly
every
day
to
choisy
le
roi
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
excursions
towards
two
o
clock
almost
invariably
the
royal
carriage
and
cavalcade
was
seen
to
pass
at
full
speed
along
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
this
served
in
lieu
of
a
watch
or
clock
to
the
poor
women
of
the
quarter
who
said
it
is
two
o
clock
there
he
is
returning
to
the
tuileries
and
some
rushed
forward
and
others
drew
up
in
line
for
a
passing
king
always
creates
a
tumult
besides
the
appearance
and
disappearance
of
louis
xviii
produced
a
certain
effect
in
the
streets
of
paris
it
was
rapid
but
majestic
this
impotent
king
had
a
taste
for
a
fast
gallop
as
he
was
not
able
to
walk
he
wished
to
run
that
cripple
would
gladly
have
had
himself
drawn
by
the
lightning
he
passed
pacific
and
severe
in
the
midst
of
naked
swords
his
massive
coach
all
covered
with
gilding
with
great
branches
of
lilies
painted
on
the
panels
thundered
noisily
along
there
was
hardly
time
to
cast
a
glance
upon
it
in
the
rear
angle
on
the
right
there
was
visible
on
tufted
cushions
of
white
satin
a
large
firm
and
ruddy
face
a
brow
freshly
powdered
a
l
oiseau
royal
a
proud
hard
crafty
eye
the
smile
of
an
educated
man
two
great
epaulets
with
bullion
fringe
floating
over
a
bourgeois
coat
the
golden
fleece
the
cross
of
saint
louis
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
silver
plaque
of
the
saint
esprit
a
huge
belly
and
a
wide
blue
ribbon
it
was
the
king
outside
of
paris
he
held
his
hat
decked
with
white
ostrich
plumes
on
his
knees
enwrapped
in
high
english
gaiters
when
he
re
entered
the
city
he
put
on
his
hat
and
saluted
rarely
he
stared
coldly
at
the
people
and
they
returned
it
in
kind
when
he
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
saint
marceau
quarter
the
whole
success
which
he
produced
is
contained
in
this
remark
of
an
inhabitant
of
the
faubourg
to
his
comrade
that
big
fellow
yonder
is
the
government
this
infallible
passage
of
the
king
at
the
same
hour
was
therefore
the
daily
event
of
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
the
promenader
in
the
yellow
coat
evidently
did
not
belong
in
the
quarter
and
probably
did
not
belong
in
paris
for
he
was
ignorant
as
to
this
detail
when
at
two
o
clock
the
royal
carriage
surrounded
by
a
squadron
of
the
body
guard
all
covered
with
silver
lace
debouched
on
the
boulevard
after
having
made
the
turn
of
the
salpetriere
he
appeared
surprised
and
almost
alarmed
there
was
no
one
but
himself
in
this
cross
lane
he
drew
up
hastily
behind
the
corner
of
the
wall
of
an
enclosure
though
this
did
not
prevent
m
le
duc
de
havre
from
spying
him
out
m
le
duc
de
havre
as
captain
of
the
guard
on
duty
that
day
was
seated
in
the
carriage
opposite
the
king
he
said
to
his
majesty
yonder
is
an
evil
looking
man
members
of
the
police
who
were
clearing
the
king
s
route
took
equal
note
of
him
one
of
them
received
an
order
to
follow
him
but
the
man
plunged
into
the
deserted
little
streets
of
the
faubourg
and
as
twilight
was
beginning
to
fall
the
agent
lost
trace
of
him
as
is
stated
in
a
report
addressed
that
same
evening
to
m
le
comte
d
angles
minister
of
state
prefect
of
police
when
the
man
in
the
yellow
coat
had
thrown
the
agent
off
his
track
he
redoubled
his
pace
not
without
turning
round
many
a
time
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
being
followed
at
a
quarter
past
four
that
is
to
say
when
night
was
fully
come
he
passed
in
front
of
the
theatre
of
the
porte
saint
martin
where
the
two
convicts
was
being
played
that
day
this
poster
illuminated
by
the
theatre
lanterns
struck
him
for
although
he
was
walking
rapidly
he
halted
to
read
it
an
instant
later
he
was
in
the
blind
alley
of
la
planchette
and
he
entered
the
plat
d
etain
the
pewter
platter
where
the
office
of
the
coach
for
lagny
was
then
situated
this
coach
set
out
at
half
past
four
the
horses
were
harnessed
and
the
travellers
summoned
by
the
coachman
were
hastily
climbing
the
lofty
iron
ladder
of
the
vehicle
the
man
inquired
have
you
a
place
only
one
beside
me
on
the
box
said
the
coachman
i
will
take
it
climb
up
nevertheless
before
setting
out
the
coachman
cast
a
glance
at
the
traveller
s
shabby
dress
at
the
diminutive
size
of
his
bundle
and
made
him
pay
his
fare
are
you
going
as
far
as
lagny
demanded
the
coachman
yes
said
the
man
the
traveller
paid
to
lagny
they
started
when
they
had
passed
the
barrier
the
coachman
tried
to
enter
into
conversation
but
the
traveller
only
replied
in
monosyllables
the
coachman
took
to
whistling
and
swearing
at
his
horses
the
coachman
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
cloak
it
was
cold
the
man
did
not
appear
to
be
thinking
of
that
thus
they
passed
gournay
and
neuilly
sur
marne
towards
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
they
reached
chelles
the
coachman
drew
up
in
front
of
the
carters
inn
installed
in
the
ancient
buildings
of
the
royal
abbey
to
give
his
horses
a
breathing
spell
i
get
down
here
said
the
man
he
took
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
and
jumped
down
from
the
vehicle
an
instant
later
he
had
disappeared
he
did
not
enter
the
inn
when
the
coach
set
out
for
lagny
a
few
minutes
later
it
did
not
encounter
him
in
the
principal
street
of
chelles
the
coachman
turned
to
the
inside
travellers
there
said
he
is
a
man
who
does
not
belong
here
for
i
do
not
know
him
he
had
not
the
air
of
owning
a
sou
but
he
does
not
consider
money
he
pays
to
lagny
and
he
goes
only
as
far
as
chelles
it
is
night
all
the
houses
are
shut
he
does
not
enter
the
inn
and
he
is
not
to
be
found
so
he
has
dived
through
the
earth
the
man
had
not
plunged
into
the
earth
but
he
had
gone
with
great
strides
through
the
dark
down
the
principal
street
of
chelles
then
he
had
turned
to
the
right
before
reaching
the
church
into
the
cross
road
leading
to
montfermeil
like
a
person
who
was
acquainted
with
the
country
and
had
been
there
before
he
followed
this
road
rapidly
at
the
spot
where
it
is
intersected
by
the
ancient
tree
bordered
road
which
runs
from
gagny
to
lagny
he
heard
people
coming
he
concealed
himself
precipitately
in
a
ditch
and
there
waited
until
the
passers
by
were
at
a
distance
the
precaution
was
nearly
superfluous
however
for
as
we
have
already
said
it
was
a
very
dark
december
night
not
more
than
two
or
three
stars
were
visible
in
the
sky
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
ascent
of
the
hill
begins
the
man
did
not
return
to
the
road
to
montfermeil
he
struck
across
the
fields
to
the
right
and
entered
the
forest
with
long
strides
once
in
the
forest
he
slackened
his
pace
and
began
a
careful
examination
of
all
the
trees
advancing
step
by
step
as
though
seeking
and
following
a
mysterious
road
known
to
himself
alone
there
came
a
moment
when
he
appeared
to
lose
himself
and
he
paused
in
indecision
at
last
he
arrived
by
dint
of
feeling
his
way
inch
by
inch
at
a
clearing
where
there
was
a
great
heap
of
whitish
stones
he
stepped
up
briskly
to
these
stones
and
examined
them
attentively
through
the
mists
of
night
as
though
he
were
passing
them
in
review
a
large
tree
covered
with
those
excrescences
which
are
the
warts
of
vegetation
stood
a
few
paces
distant
from
the
pile
of
stones
he
went
up
to
this
tree
and
passed
his
hand
over
the
bark
of
the
trunk
as
though
seeking
to
recognize
and
count
all
the
warts
opposite
this
tree
which
was
an
ash
there
was
a
chestnut
tree
suffering
from
a
peeling
of
the
bark
to
which
a
band
of
zinc
had
been
nailed
by
way
of
dressing
he
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
and
touched
this
band
of
zinc
then
he
trod
about
for
awhile
on
the
ground
comprised
in
the
space
between
the
tree
and
the
heap
of
stones
like
a
person
who
is
trying
to
assure
himself
that
the
soil
has
not
recently
been
disturbed
that
done
he
took
his
bearings
and
resumed
his
march
through
the
forest
it
was
the
man
who
had
just
met
cosette
as
he
walked
through
the
thicket
in
the
direction
of
montfermeil
he
had
espied
that
tiny
shadow
moving
with
a
groan
depositing
a
burden
on
the
ground
then
taking
it
up
and
setting
out
again
he
drew
near
and
perceived
that
it
was
a
very
young
child
laden
with
an
enormous
bucket
of
water
then
he
approached
the
child
and
silently
grasped
the
handle
of
the
bucket

with
the
stranger
in
the
dark
cosette
as
we
have
said

accosted
her
he
spoke
in
a
voice
that
was
grave

almost
bass
my

the

walked
along
beside
her
it
really

muttered
between
his
teeth
then
he
added
how

are
you

the
man
said
nothing
for
a
moment
then
he
remarked
abruptly
so

know
answered
the
child
before
the
man
had
time
to
speak
again
she
added
i
don
t
think
so
other
people
have
mothers
i
have
none
and
after
a
silence
she
went
on
i
think
that
i
never
had
any
the
man
halted
he
set
the
bucket
on
the
ground
bent
down
and
placed
both
hands
on
the
child
s
shoulders
making
an
effort
to
look
at
her
and
to
see
her
face
in
the
dark
cosette
s
thin
and
sickly
face
was
vaguely
outlined
by
the
livid
light
in
the
sky
what
is
your
name
said
the
man
cosette
the
man
seemed
to
have
received
an
electric
shock
he
looked
at
her
once
more
then
he
removed
his
hands
from
cosette
s
shoulders
seized
the
bucket
and
set
out
again
after
a
moment
he
inquired
where
do
you
live
little
one
at
montfermeil
if
you
know
where
that
is
that
is
where
we
are
going
yes
sir
he
paused
then
began
again
who
sent
you
at
such
an
hour
to
get
water
in
the
forest
it
was
madame
thenardier
the
man
resumed
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
render
indifferent
but
in
which
there
was
nevertheless
a
singular
tremor
what
does
your
madame
thenardier
do
she
is
my
mistress
said
the
child
she
keeps
the
inn
the
inn
said
the
man
well
i
am
going
to
lodge
there
to
night
show
me
the
way
we
are
on
the
way
there
said
the
child
the
man
walked
tolerably
fast
cosette
followed
him
without
difficulty
she
no
longer
felt
any
fatigue
from
time
to
time
she
raised
her
eyes
towards
the
man
with
a
sort
of
tranquillity
and
an
indescribable
confidence
she
had
never
been
taught
to
turn
to
providence
and
to
pray
nevertheless
she
felt
within
her
something
which
resembled
hope
and
joy
and
which
mounted
towards
heaven
several
minutes
elapsed
the
man
resumed
is
there
no
servant
in
madame
thenardier
s
house
no
sir
are
you
alone
there
yes
sir
another
pause
ensued
cosette
lifted
up
her
voice
that
is
to
say
there
are
two
little
girls
what
little
girls
ponine
and
zelma
this
was
the
way
the
child
simplified
the
romantic
names
so
dear
to
the
female
thenardier
who
are
ponine
and
zelma
they
are
madame
thenardier
s
young
ladies
her
daughters
as
you
would
say
and
what
do
those
girls
do
oh
said
the
child
they
have
beautiful
dolls
things
with
gold
in
them
all
full
of
affairs
they
play
they
amuse
themselves
all
day
long
yes
sir
and
you
i
i
work
all
day
long
the
child
raised
her
great
eyes
in
which
hung
a
tear
which
was
not
visible
because
of
the
darkness
and
replied
gently
yes
sir
after
an
interval
of
silence
she
went
on
sometimes
when
i
have
finished
my
work
and
they
let
me
i
amuse
myself
too
how
do
you
amuse
yourself
in
the
best
way
i
can
they
let
me
alone
but
i
have
not
many
playthings
ponine
and
zelma
will
not
let
me
play
with
their
dolls
i
have
only
a
little
lead
sword
no
longer
than
that
the
child
held
up
her
tiny
finger
and
it
will
not
cut
yes
sir
said
the
child
it
cuts
salad
and
the
heads
of
flies
they
reached
the
village
cosette
guided
the
stranger
through
the
streets
they
passed
the
bakeshop
but
cosette
did
not
think
of
the
bread
which
she
had
been
ordered
to
fetch
the
man
had
ceased
to
ply
her
with
questions
and
now
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
when
they
had
left
the
church
behind
them
the
man
on
perceiving
all
the
open
air
booths
asked
cosette
so
there
is
a
fair
going
on
here
no
sir
it
is
christmas
as
they
approached
the
tavern
cosette
timidly
touched
his
arm
monsieur
what
my
child
we
are
quite
near
the
house
well
will
you
let
me
take
my
bucket
now
why
if
madame
sees
that
some
one
has
carried
it
for
me
she
will
beat
me
the
man
handed
her
the
bucket
an
instant
later
they
were
at
the
tavern
door
chapter
viii
the
unpleasantness
of
receiving
into
one
s
house
a
poor
man
who
may
be
a
rich
man
cosette
could
not
refrain
from
casting
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
big
doll
which
was
still
displayed
at
the
toy
merchant
s
then
she
knocked
the
door
opened
the
thenardier
appeared
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
ah
so
it
s
you
you
little
wretch
good
mercy
but
you
ve
taken
your
time
the
hussy
has
been
amusing
herself
madame
said
cosette
trembling
all
over
here
s
a
gentleman
who
wants
a
lodging
the
thenardier
speedily
replaced
her
gruff
air
by
her
amiable
grimace
a
change
of
aspect
common
to
tavern
keepers
and
eagerly
sought
the
new
comer
with
her
eyes
this
is
the
gentleman
said
she
yes
madame
replied
the
man
raising
his
hand
to
his
hat
wealthy
travellers
are
not
so
polite
this
gesture
and
an
inspection
of
the
stranger
s
costume
and
baggage
which
the
thenardier
passed
in
review
with
one
glance
caused
the
amiable
grimace
to
vanish
and
the
gruff
mien
to
reappear
she
resumed
dryly
enter
my
good
man
the
good
man
entered
the
thenardier
cast
a
second
glance
at
him
paid
particular
attention
to
his
frock
coat
which
was
absolutely
threadbare
and
to
his
hat
which
was
a
little
battered
and
tossing
her
head
wrinkling
her
nose
and
screwing
up
her
eyes
she
consulted
her
husband
who
was
still
drinking
with
the
carters
the
husband
replied
by
that
imperceptible
movement
of
the
forefinger
which
backed
up
by
an
inflation
of
the
lips
signifies
in
such
cases
a
regular
beggar
thereupon
the
thenardier
exclaimed
ah
see
here
my
good
man
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
have
no
room
left
put
me
where
you
like
said
the
man
in
the
attic
in
the
stable
i
will
pay
as
though
i
occupied
a
room
forty
sous
forty
sous
agreed
very
well
then
forty
sous
said
a
carter
in
a
low
tone
to
the
thenardier
woman
why
the
charge
is
only
twenty
sous
it
is
forty
in
his
case
retorted
the
thenardier
in
the
same
tone
i
don
t
lodge
poor
folks
for
less
that
s
true
added
her
husband
gently
it
ruins
a
house
to
have
such
people
in
it
in
the
meantime
the
man
laying
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
on
a
bench
had
seated
himself
at
a
table
on
which
cosette
made
haste
to
place
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
glass
the
merchant
who
had
demanded
the
bucket
of
water
took
it
to
his
horse
himself
cosette
resumed
her
place
under
the
kitchen
table
and
her
knitting
the
man
who
had
barely
moistened
his
lips
in
the
wine
which
he
had
poured
out
for
himself
observed
the
child
with
peculiar
attention
cosette
was
ugly
if
she
had
been
happy
she
might
have
been
pretty
we
have
already
given
a
sketch
of
that
sombre
little
figure
cosette
was
thin
and
pale
she
was
nearly
eight
years
old
but
she
seemed
to
be
hardly
six
her
large
eyes
sunken
in
a
sort
of
shadow
were
almost
put
out
with
weeping
the
corners
of
her
mouth
had
that
curve
of
habitual
anguish
which
is
seen
in
condemned
persons
and
desperately
sick
people
her
hands
were
as
her
mother
had
divined
ruined
with
chilblains
the
fire
which
illuminated
her
at
that
moment
brought
into
relief
all
the
angles
of
her
bones
and
rendered
her
thinness
frightfully
apparent
as
she
was
always
shivering
she
had
acquired
the
habit
of
pressing
her
knees
one
against
the
other
her
entire
clothing
was
but
a
rag
which
would
have
inspired
pity
in
summer
and
which
inspired
horror
in
winter
all
she
had
on
was
hole
ridden
linen
not
a
scrap
of
woollen
her
skin
was
visible
here
and
there
and
everywhere
black
and
blue
spots
could
be
descried
which
marked
the
places
where
the
thenardier
woman
had
touched
her
her
naked
legs
were
thin
and
red
the
hollows
in
her
neck
were
enough
to
make
one
weep
this
child
s
whole
person
her
mien
her
attitude
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
intervals
which
she
allowed
to
elapse
between
one
word
and
the
next
her
glance
her
silence
her
slightest
gesture
expressed
and
betrayed
one
sole
idea
fear
fear
was
diffused
all
over
her
she
was
covered
with
it
so
to
speak
fear
drew
her
elbows
close
to
her
hips
withdrew
her
heels
under
her
petticoat
made
her
occupy
as
little
space
as
possible
allowed
her
only
the
breath
that
was
absolutely
necessary
and
had
become
what
might
be
called
the
habit
of
her
body
admitting
of
no
possible
variation
except
an
increase
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
there
was
an
astonished
nook
where
terror
lurked
her
fear
was
such
that
on
her
arrival
wet
as
she
was
cosette
did
not
dare
to
approach
the
fire
and
dry
herself
but
sat
silently
down
to
her
work
again
the
expression
in
the
glance
of
that
child
of
eight
years
was
habitually
so
gloomy
and
at
times
so
tragic
that
it
seemed
at
certain
moments
as
though
she
were
on
the
verge
of
becoming
an
idiot
or
a
demon
as
we
have
stated
she
had
never
known
what
it
is
to
pray
she
had
never
set
foot
in
a
church
have
i
the
time
said
the
thenardier
the
man
in
the
yellow
coat
never
took
his
eyes
from
cosette
all
at
once
the
thenardier
exclaimed
by
the
way
where
s
that
bread
cosette
according
to
her
custom
whenever
the
thenardier
uplifted
her
voice
emerged
with
great
haste
from
beneath
the
table
she
had
completely
forgotten
the
bread
she
had
recourse
to
the
expedient
of
children
who
live
in
a
constant
state
of
fear
she
lied
madame
the
baker
s
shop
was
shut
you
should
have
knocked
i
did
knock
madame
well
he
did
not
open
the
door
i
ll
find
out
to
morrow
whether
that
is
true
said
the
thenardier
and
if
you
are
telling
me
a
lie
i
ll
lead
you
a
pretty
dance
in
the
meantime
give
me
back
my
fifteen
sou
piece
cosette
plunged
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
and
turned
green
the
fifteen
sou
piece
was
not
there
ah
come
now
said
madame
thenardier
did
you
hear
me
cosette
turned
her
pocket
inside
out
there
was
nothing
in
it
what
could
have
become
of
that
money
the
unhappy
little
creature
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
she
was
petrified
have
you
lost
that
fifteen
sou
piece
screamed
the
thenardier
hoarsely
or
do
you
want
to
rob
me
of
it
at
the
same
time
she
stretched
out
her
arm
towards
the
cat
o
nine
tails
which
hung
on
a
nail
in
the
chimney
corner
this
formidable
gesture
restored
to
cosette
sufficient
strength
to
shriek
mercy
madame
madame
i
will
not
do
so
any
more
the
thenardier
took
down
the
whip
in
the
meantime
the
man
in
the
yellow
coat
had
been
fumbling
in
the
fob
of
his
waistcoat
without
any
one
having
noticed
his
movements
besides
the
other
travellers
were
drinking
or
playing
cards
and
were
not
paying
attention
to
anything
cosette
contracted
herself
into
a
ball
with
anguish
within
the
angle
of
the
chimney
endeavoring
to
gather
up
and
conceal
her
poor
half
nude
limbs
the
thenardier
raised
her
arm
pardon
me
madame
said
the
man
but
just
now
i
caught
sight
of
something
which
had
fallen
from
this
little
one
s
apron
pocket
and
rolled
aside
perhaps
this
is
it
at
the
same
time
he
bent
down
and
seemed
to
be
searching
on
the
floor
for
a
moment
exactly
here
it
is
he
went
on
straightening
himself
up
and
he
held
out
a
silver
coin
to
the
thenardier
yes
that
s
it
said
she
it
was
not
it
for
it
was
a
twenty
sou
piece
but
the
thenardier
found
it
to
her
advantage
she
put
the
coin
in
her
pocket
and
confined
herself
to
casting
a
fierce
glance
at
the
child
accompanied
with
the
remark
don
t
let
this
ever
happen
again
cosette
returned
to
what
the
thenardier
called
her
kennel
and
her
large
eyes
which
were
riveted
on
the
traveller
began
to
take
on
an
expression
such
as
they
had
never
worn
before
thus
far
it
was
only
an
innocent
amazement
but
a
sort
of
stupefied
confidence
was
mingled
with
it
by
the
way
would
you
like
some
supper
the
thenardier
inquired
of
the
traveller
he
made
no
reply
he
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
thought
what
sort
of
a
man
is
that
she
muttered
between
her
teeth
he
s
some
frightfully
poor
wretch
he
hasn
t
a
sou
to
pay
for
a
supper
will
he
even
pay
me
for
his
lodging
it
s
very
lucky
all
the
same
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
steal
the
money
that
was
on
the
floor
in
the
meantime
a
door
had
opened
and
eponine
and
azelma
entered
they
were
two
really
pretty
little
girls
more
bourgeois
than
peasant
in
looks
and
very
charming
the
one
with
shining
chestnut
tresses
the
other
with
long
black
braids
hanging
down
her
back
both
vivacious
neat
plump
rosy
and
healthy
and
a
delight
to
the
eye
they
were
warmly
clad
but
with
so
much
maternal
art
that
the
thickness
of
the
stuffs
did
not
detract
from
the
coquetry
of
arrangement
there
was
a
hint
of
winter
though
the
springtime
was
not
wholly
effaced
light
emanated
from
these
two
little
beings
besides
this
they
were
on
the
throne
in
their
toilettes
in
their
gayety
in
the
noise
which
they
made
there
was
sovereignty
when
they
entered
the
thenardier
said
to
them
in
a
grumbling
tone
which
was
full
of
adoration
ah
there
you
are
you
children
then
drawing
them
one
after
the
other
to
her
knees
smoothing
their
hair
tying
their
ribbons
afresh
and
then
releasing
them
with
that
gentle
manner
of
shaking
off
which
is
peculiar
to
mothers
she
exclaimed
what
frights
they
are
they
went
and
seated
themselves
in
the
chimney
corner
they
had
a
doll
which
they
turned
over
and
over
on
their
knees
with
all
sorts
of
joyous
chatter
from
time
to
time
cosette
raised
her
eyes
from
her
knitting
and
watched
their
play
with
a
melancholy
air
eponine
and
azelma
did
not
look
at
cosette
she
was
the
same
as
a
dog
to
them
these
three
little
girls
did
not
yet
reckon
up
four
and
twenty
years
between
them
but
they
already
represented
the
whole
society
of
man
envy
on
the
one
side
disdain
on
the
other
the
doll
of
the
thenardier
sisters
was
very
much
faded
very
old
and
much
broken
but
it
seemed
none
the
less
admirable
to
cosette
who
had
never
had
a
doll
in
her
life
a
real
doll
to
make
use
of
the
expression
which
all
children
will
understand
all
at
once
the
thenardier
who
had
been
going
back
and
forth
in
the
room
perceived
that
cosette
s
mind
was
distracted
and
that
instead
of
working
she
was
paying
attention
to
the
little
ones
at
their
play
ah
i
ve
caught
you
at
it
she
cried
so
that
s
the
way
you
work
i
ll
make
you
work
to
the
tune
of
the
whip
that
i
will
the
stranger
turned
to
the
thenardier
without
quitting
his
chair
bah
madame
he
said
with
an
almost
timid
air
let
her
play
such
a
wish
expressed
by
a
traveller
who
had
eaten
a
slice
of
mutton
and
had
drunk
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
with
his
supper
and
who
had
not
the
air
of
being
frightfully
poor
would
have
been
equivalent
to
an
order
but
that
a
man
with
such
a
hat
should
permit
himself
such
a
desire
and
that
a
man
with
such
a
coat
should
permit
himself
to
have
a
will
was
something
which
madame
thenardier
did
not
intend
to
tolerate
she
retorted
with
acrimony
she
must
work
since
she
eats
i
don
t
feed
her
to
do
nothing
what
is
she
making
went
on
the
stranger
in
a
gentle
voice
which
contrasted
strangely
with
his
beggarly
garments
and
his
porter
s
shoulders
the
thenardier
deigned
to
reply
stockings
if
you
please
stockings
for
my
little
girls
who
have
none
so
to
speak
and
who
are
absolutely
barefoot
just
now
the
man
looked
at
cosette
s
poor
little
red
feet
and
continued
when
will
she
have
finished
this
pair
of
stockings
she
has
at
least
three
or
four
good
days
work
on
them
still
the
lazy
creature
and
how
much
will
that
pair
of
stockings
be
worth
when
she
has
finished
them
the
thenardier
cast
a
glance
of
disdain
on
him
thirty
sous
at
least
will
you
sell
them
for
five
francs
went
on
the
man
good
heavens
exclaimed
a
carter
who
was
listening
with
a
loud
laugh
five
francs
the
deuce
i
should
think
so
five
balls
thenardier
thought
it
time
to
strike
in
yes
sir
if
such
is
your
fancy
you
will
be
allowed
to
have
that
pair
of
stockings
for
five
francs
we
can
refuse
nothing
to
travellers
you
must
pay
on
the
spot
said
the
thenardier
in
her
curt
and
peremptory
fashion
i
will
buy
that
pair
of
stockings
replied
the
man
and
he
added
drawing
a
five
franc
piece
from
his
pocket
and
laying
it
on
the
table
i
will
pay
for
them
then
he
turned
to
cosette
now
i
own
your
work
play
my
child
the
carter
was
so
much
touched
by
the
five
franc
piece
that
he
abandoned
his
glass
and
hastened
up
but
it
s
true
he
cried
examining
it
a
real
hind
wheel
and
not
counterfeit
thenardier
approached
and
silently
put
the
coin
in
his
pocket
the
thenardier
had
no
reply
to
make
she
bit
her
lips
and
her
face
assumed
an
expression
of
hatred
in
the
meantime
cosette
was
trembling
she
ventured
to
ask
is
it
true
madame
may
i
play
play
said
the
thenardier
in
a
terrible
voice
thanks
madame
said
cosette
and
while
her
mouth
thanked
the
thenardier
her
whole
little
soul
thanked
the
traveller
thenardier
had
resumed
his
drinking
his
wife
whispered
in
his
ear
who
can
this
yellow
man
be
i
have
seen
millionaires
with
coats
like
that
replied
thenardier
in
a
sovereign
manner
cosette
had
dropped
her
knitting
but
had
not
left
her
seat
cosette
always
moved
as
little
as
possible
she
picked
up
some
old
rags
and
her
little
lead
sword
from
a
box
behind
her
eponine
and
azelma
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
going
on
they
had
just
executed
a
very
important
operation
they
had
just
got
hold
of
the
cat
they
had
thrown
their
doll
on
the
ground
and
eponine
who
was
the
elder
was
swathing
the
little
cat
in
spite
of
its
mewing
and
its
contortions
in
a
quantity
of
clothes
and
red
and
blue
scraps
while
performing
this
serious
and
difficult
work
she
was
saying
to
her
sister
in
that
sweet
and
adorable
language
of
children
whose
grace
like
the
splendor
of
the
butterfly
s
wing
vanishes
when
one
essays
to
fix
it
fast
you
see
sister
this
doll
is
more
amusing
than
the
other
she
twists
she
cries
she
is
warm
see
sister
let
us
play
with
her
she
shall
be
my
little
girl
i
will
be
a
lady
i
will
come
to
see
you
and
you
shall
look
at
her
gradually
you
will
perceive
her
whiskers
and
that
will
surprise
you
and
then
you
will
see
her
ears
and
then
you
will
see
her
tail
and
it
will
amaze
you
and
you
will
say
to
me
ah
mon
dieu
and
i
will
say
to
you
yes
madame
it
is
my
little
girl
little
girls
are
made
like
that
just
at
present
azelma
listened
admiringly
to
eponine
in
the
meantime
the
drinkers
had
begun
to
sing
an
obscene
song
and
to
laugh
at
it
until
the
ceiling
shook
thenardier
accompanied
and
encouraged
them
as
birds
make
nests
out
of
everything
so
children
make
a
doll
out
of
anything
which
comes
to
hand
while
eponine
and
azelma
were
bundling
up
the
cat
cosette
on
her
side
had
dressed
up
her
sword
that
done
she
laid
it
in
her
arms
and
sang
to
it
softly
to
lull
it
to
sleep
the
doll
is
one
of
the
most
imperious
needs
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
charming
instincts
of
feminine
childhood
to
care
for
to
clothe
to
deck
to
dress
to
undress
to
redress
to
teach
scold
a
little
to
rock
to
dandle
to
lull
to
sleep
to
imagine
that
something
is
some
one
therein
lies
the
whole
woman
s
future
while
dreaming
and
chattering
making
tiny
outfits
and
baby
clothes
while
sewing
little
gowns
and
corsages
and
bodices
the
child
grows
into
a
young
girl
the
young
girl
into
a
big
girl
the
big
girl
into
a
woman
the
first
child
is
the
continuation
of
the
last
doll
a
little
girl
without
a
doll
is
almost
as
unhappy
and
quite
as
impossible
as
a
woman
without
children
so
cosette
had
made
herself
a
doll
out
of
the
sword
madame
thenardier
approached
the
yellow
man
my
husband
is
right
she
thought
perhaps
it
is
m
laffitte
there
are
such
queer
rich
men
she
came
and
set
her
elbows
on
the
table
monsieur
said
she
at
this
word
monsieur
the
man
turned
up
to
that
time
the
thenardier
had
addressed
him
only
as
brave
homme
or
bonhomme
you
see
sir
she
pursued
assuming
a
sweetish
air
that
was
even
more
repulsive
to
behold
than
her
fierce
mien
i
am
willing
that
the
child
should
play
i
do
not
oppose
it
but
it
is
good
for
once
because
you
are
generous
you
see
she
has
nothing
she
must
needs
work
then
this
child
is
not
yours
demanded
the
man
oh
mon
dieu
no
sir
she
is
a
little
beggar
whom
we
have
taken
in
through
charity
a
sort
of
imbecile
child
she
must
have
water
on
the
brain
she
has
a
large
head
as
you
see
we
do
what
we
can
for
her
for
we
are
not
rich
we
have
written
in
vain
to
her
native
place
and
have
received
no
reply
these
six
months
it
must
be
that
her
mother
is
dead
ah
said
the
man
and
fell
into
his
revery
once
more
her
mother
didn
t
amount
to
much
added
the
thenardier
she
abandoned
her
child
during
the
whole
of
this
conversation
cosette
as
though
warned
by
some
instinct
that
she
was
under
discussion
had
not
taken
her
eyes
from
the
thenardier
s
face
she
listened
vaguely
she
caught
a
few
words
here
and
there
meanwhile
the
drinkers
all
three
quarters
intoxicated
were
repeating
their
unclean
refrain
with
redoubled
gayety
it
was
a
highly
spiced
and
wanton
song
in
which
the
virgin
and
the
infant
jesus
were
introduced
the
thenardier
went
off
to
take
part
in
the
shouts
of
laughter
cosette
from
her
post
under
the
table
gazed
at
the
fire
which
was
reflected
from
her
fixed
eyes
she
had
begun
to
rock
the
sort
of
baby
which
she
had
made
and
as
she
rocked
it
she
sang
in
a
low
voice
my
mother
is
dead
my
mother
is
dead
my
mother
is
dead
on
being
urged
afresh
by
the
hostess
the
yellow
man
the
millionaire
consented
at
last
to
take
supper
what
does
monsieur
wish
bread
and
cheese
said
the
man
decidedly
he
is
a
beggar
thought
madame
thenardier
the
drunken
men
were
still
singing
their
song
and
the
child
under
the
table
was
singing
hers
all
at
once
cosette
paused
she
had
just
turned
round
and
caught
sight
of
the
little
thenardiers
doll
which
they
had
abandoned
for
the
cat
and
had
left
on
the
floor
a
few
paces
from
the
kitchen
table
then
she
dropped
the
swaddled
sword
which
only
half
met
her
needs
and
cast
her
eyes
slowly
round
the
room
madame
thenardier
was
whispering
to
her
husband
and
counting
over
some
money
ponine
and
zelma
were
playing
with
the
cat
the
travellers
were
eating
or
drinking
or
singing
not
a
glance
was
fixed
on
her
she
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
she
crept
out
from
under
the
table
on
her
hands
and
knees
made
sure
once
more
that
no
one
was
watching
her
then
she
slipped
quickly
up
to
the
doll
and
seized
it
an
instant
later
she
was
in
her
place
again
seated
motionless
and
only
turned
so
as
to
cast
a
shadow
on
the
doll
which
she
held
in
her
arms
the
happiness
of
playing
with
a
doll
was
so
rare
for
her
that
it
contained
all
the
violence
of
voluptuousness
no
one
had
seen
her
except
the
traveller
who
was
slowly
devouring
his
meagre
supper
this
joy
lasted
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
with
all
the
precautions
that
cosette
had
taken
she
did
not
perceive
that
one
of
the
doll
s
legs
stuck
out
and
that
the
fire
on
the
hearth
lighted
it
up
very
vividly
that
pink
and
shining
foot
projecting
from
the
shadow
suddenly
struck
the
eye
of
azelma
who
said
to
eponine
look
sister
the
two
little
girls
paused
in
stupefaction
cosette
had
dared
to
take
their
doll
eponine
rose
and
without
releasing
the
cat
she
ran
to
her
mother
and
began
to
tug
at
her
skirt
let
me
alone
said
her
mother
what
do
you
want
mother
said
the
child
look
there
and
she
pointed
to
cosette
cosette
absorbed
in
the
ecstasies
of
possession
no
longer
saw
or
heard
anything
madame
thenardier
s
countenance
assumed
that
peculiar
expression
which
is
composed
of
the
terrible
mingled
with
the
trifles
of
life
and
which
has
caused
this
style
of
woman
to
be
named
megaeras
on
this
occasion
wounded
pride
exasperated
her
wrath
still
further
cosette
had
overstepped
all
bounds
cosette
had
laid
violent
hands
on
the
doll
belonging
to
these
young
ladies
a
czarina
who
should
see
a
muzhik
trying
on
her
imperial
son
s
blue
ribbon
would
wear
no
other
face
she
shrieked
in
a
voice
rendered
hoarse
with
indignation
cosette
cosette
started
as
though
the
earth
had
trembled
beneath
her
she
turned
round
cosette
repeated
the
thenardier
cosette
took
the
doll
and
laid
it
gently
on
the
floor
with
a
sort
of
veneration
mingled
with
despair
then
without
taking
her
eyes
from
it
she
clasped
her
hands
and
what
is
terrible
to
relate
of
a
child
of
that
age
she
wrung
them
then
not
one
of
the
emotions
of
the
day
neither
the
trip
to
the
forest
nor
the
weight
of
the
bucket
of
water
nor
the
loss
of
the
money
nor
the
sight
of
the
whip
nor
even
the
sad
words
which
she
had
heard
madame
thenardier
utter
had
been
able
to
wring
this
from
her
she
wept
she
burst
out
sobbing
meanwhile
the
traveller
had
risen
to
his
feet
what
is
the
matter
he
said
to
the
thenardier
don
t
you
see
said
the
thenardier
pointing
to
the
corpus
delicti
which
lay
at
cosette
s
feet
well
what
of
it
resumed
the
man
that
beggar
replied
the
thenardier
has
permitted
herself
to
touch
the
children
s
doll
all
this
noise
for
that
said
the
man
well
what
if
she
did
play
with
that
doll
she
touched
it
with
her
dirty
hands
pursued
the
thenardier
with
her
frightful
hands
here
cosette
redoubled
her
sobs
will
you
stop
your
noise
screamed
the
thenardier
the
man
went
straight
to
the
street
door
opened
it
and
stepped
out
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
the
thenardier
profited
by
his
absence
to
give
cosette
a
hearty
kick
under
the
table
which
made
the
child
utter
loud
cries
the
door
opened
again
the
man
re
appeared
he
carried
in
both
hands
the
fabulous
doll
which
we
have
mentioned
and
which
all
the
village
brats
had
been
staring
at
ever
since
the
morning
and
he
set
it
upright
in
front
of
cosette
saying
here
this
is
for
you
it
must
be
supposed
that
in
the
course
of
the
hour
and
more
which
he
had
spent
there
he
had
taken
confused
notice
through
his
revery
of
that
toy
shop
lighted
up
by
fire
pots
and
candles
so
splendidly
that
it
was
visible
like
an
illumination
through
the
window
of
the
drinking
shop
cosette
raised
her
eyes
she
gazed
at
the
man
approaching
her
with
that
doll
as
she
might
have
gazed
at
the
sun
she
heard
the
unprecedented
words
it
is
for
you
she
stared
at
him
she
stared
at
the
doll
then
she
slowly
retreated
and
hid
herself
at
the
extreme
end
under
the
table
in
a
corner
of
the
wall
she
no
longer
cried
she
no
longer
wept
she
had
the
appearance
of
no
longer
daring
to
breathe
the
thenardier
eponine
and
azelma
were
like
statues
also
the
very
drinkers
had
paused
a
solemn
silence
reigned
through
the
whole
room
madame
thenardier
petrified
and
mute
recommenced
her
conjectures
who
is
that
old
fellow
is
he
a
poor
man
is
he
a
millionaire
perhaps
he
is
both
that
is
to
say
a
thief
the
face
of
the
male
thenardier
presented
that
expressive
fold
which
accentuates
the
human
countenance
whenever
the
dominant
instinct
appears
there
in
all
its
bestial
force
the
tavern
keeper
stared
alternately
at
the
doll
and
at
the
traveller
he
seemed
to
be
scenting
out
the
man
as
he
would
have
scented
out
a
bag
of
money
this
did
not
last
longer
than
the
space
of
a
flash
of
lightning
he
stepped
up
to
his
wife
and
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
that
machine
costs
at
least
thirty
francs
no
nonsense
down
on
your
belly
before
that
man
gross
natures
have
this
in
common
with
naive
natures
that
they
possess
no
transition
state
well
cosette
said
the
thenardier
in
a
voice
that
strove
to
be
sweet
and
which
was
composed
of
the
bitter
honey
of
malicious
women
aren
t
you
going
to
take
your
doll
cosette
ventured
to
emerge
from
her
hole
the
gentleman
has
given
you
a
doll
my
little
cosette
said
thenardier
with
a
caressing
air
take
it
it
is
yours
cosette
gazed
at
the
marvellous
doll
in
a
sort
of
terror
her
face
was
still
flooded
with
tears
but
her
eyes
began
to
fill
like
the
sky
at
daybreak
with
strange
beams
of
joy
what
she
felt
at
that
moment
was
a
little
like
what
she
would
have
felt
if
she
had
been
abruptly
told
little
one
you
are
the
queen
of
france
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
touched
that
doll
lightning
would
dart
from
it
this
was
true
up
to
a
certain
point
for
she
said
to
herself
that
the
thenardier
would
scold
and
beat
her
nevertheless
the
attraction
carried
the
day
she
ended
by
drawing
near
and
murmuring
timidly
as
she
turned
towards
madame
thenardier
may
i
madame
no
words
can
render
that
air
at
once
despairing
terrified
and
ecstatic
pardi
cried
the
thenardier
it
is
yours
the
gentleman
has
given
it
to
you
truly
sir
said
cosette
is
it
true
is
the
lady
mine
the
stranger
s
eyes
seemed
to
be
full
of
tears
he
appeared
to
have
reached
that
point
of
emotion
where
a
man
does
not
speak
for
fear
lest
he
should
weep
he
nodded
to
cosette
and
placed
the
lady
s
hand
in
her
tiny
hand
cosette
hastily
withdrew
her
hand
as
though
that
of
the
lady
scorched
her
and
began
to
stare
at
the
floor
we
are
forced
to
add
that
at
that
moment
she
stuck
out
her
tongue
immoderately
all
at
once
she
wheeled
round
and
seized
the
doll
in
a
transport
i
shall
call
her
catherine
she
said
it
was
an
odd
moment
when
cosette
s
rags
met
and
clasped
the
ribbons
and
fresh
pink
muslins
of
the
doll
madame
she
resumed
may
i
put
her
on
a
chair
yes
my
child
replied
the
thenardier
it
was
now
the
turn
of
eponine
and
azelma
to
gaze
at
cosette
with
envy
cosette
placed
catherine
on
a
chair
then
seated
herself
on
the
floor
in
front
of
her
and
remained
motionless
without
uttering
a
word
in
an
attitude
of
contemplation
play
cosette
said
the
stranger
oh
i
am
playing
returned
the
child
this
stranger
this
unknown
individual
who
had
the
air
of
a
visit
which
providence
was
making
on
cosette
was
the
person
whom
the
thenardier
hated
worse
than
any
one
in
the
world
at
that
moment
however
it
was
necessary
to
control
herself
habituated
as
she
was
to
dissimulation
through
endeavoring
to
copy
her
husband
in
all
his
actions
these
emotions
were
more
than
she
could
endure
she
made
haste
to
send
her
daughters
to
bed
then
she
asked
the
man
s
permission
to
send
cosette
off
also
for
she
has
worked
hard
all
day
she
added
with
a
maternal
air
cosette
went
off
to
bed
carrying
catherine
in
her
arms
from
time
to
time
the
thenardier
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
her
husband
was
to
relieve
her
soul
as
she
said
she
exchanged
with
her
husband
words
which
were
all
the
more
furious
because
she
dared
not
utter
them
aloud
old
beast
what
has
he
got
in
his
belly
to
come
and
upset
us
in
this
manner
to
want
that
little
monster
to
play
to
give
away
forty
franc
dolls
to
a
jade
that
i
would
sell
for
forty
sous
so
i
would
a
little
more
and
he
will
be
saying
your
majesty
to
her
as
though
to
the
duchess
de
berry
is
there
any
sense
in
it
is
he
mad
then
that
mysterious
old
fellow
why
it
is
perfectly
simple
replied
thenardier
if
that
amuses
him
it
amuses
you
to
have
the
little
one
work
it
amuses
him
to
have
her
play
he
s
all
right
a
traveller
can
do
what
he
pleases
when
he
pays
for
it
if
the
old
fellow
is
a
philanthropist
what
is
that
to
you
if
he
is
an
imbecile
it
does
not
concern
you
what
are
you
worrying
for
so
long
as
he
has
money
the
language
of
a
master
and
the
reasoning
of
an
innkeeper
neither
of
which
admitted
of
any
reply
the
man
had
placed
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
resumed
his
thoughtful
attitude
all
the
other
travellers
both
pedlers
and
carters
had
withdrawn
a
little
and
had
ceased
singing
they
were
staring
at
him
from
a
distance
with
a
sort
of
respectful
awe
this
poorly
dressed
man
who
drew
hind
wheels
from
his
pocket
with
so
much
ease
and
who
lavished
gigantic
dolls
on
dirty
little
brats
in
wooden
shoes
was
certainly
a
magnificent
fellow
and
one
to
be
feared
many
hours
passed
the
midnight
mass
was
over
the
chimes
had
ceased
the
drinkers
had
taken
their
departure
the
drinking
shop
was
closed
the
public
room
was
deserted
the
fire
extinct
the
stranger
still
remained
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
attitude
from
time
to
time
he
changed
the
elbow
on
which
he
leaned
that
was
all
but
he
had
not
said
a
word
since
cosette
had
left
the
room
the
thenardiers
alone
out
of
politeness
and
curiosity
had
remained
in
the
room
is
he
going
to
pass
the
night
in
that
fashion
grumbled
the
thenardier
when
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
struck
she
declared
herself
vanquished
and
said
to
her
husband
i
m
going
to
bed
do
as
you
like
her
husband
seated
himself
at
a
table
in
the
corner
lighted
a
candle
and
began
to
read
the
courrier
francais
a
good
hour
passed
thus
the
worthy
inn
keeper
had
perused
the
courrier
francais
at
least
three
times
from
the
date
of
the
number
to
the
printer
s
name
the
stranger
did
not
stir
thenardier
fidgeted
coughed
spit
blew
his
nose
and
creaked
his
chair
not
a
movement
on
the
man
s
part
is
he
asleep
thought
thenardier
the
man
was
not
asleep
but
nothing
could
arouse
him
at
last
thenardier
took
off
his
cap
stepped
gently
up
to
him
and
ventured
to
say
is
not
monsieur
going
to
his
repose
not
going
to
bed
would
have
seemed
to
him
excessive
and
familiar
to
repose
smacked
of
luxury
and
respect
these
words
possess
the
mysterious
and
admirable
property
of
swelling
the
bill
on
the
following
day
a
chamber
where
one
sleeps
costs
twenty
sous
a
chamber
in
which
one
reposes
costs
twenty
francs
well
said
the
stranger
you
are
right
where
is
your
stable
sir
exclaimed
thenardier
with
a
smile
i
will
conduct
you
sir
he
took
the
candle
the
man
picked
up
his
bundle
and
cudgel
and
thenardier
conducted
him
to
a
chamber
on
the
first
floor
which
was
of
rare
splendor
all
furnished
in
mahogany
with
a
low
bedstead
curtained
with
red
calico
what
is
this
said
the
traveller
it
is
really
our
bridal
chamber
said
the
tavern
keeper
my
wife
and
i
occupy
another
this
is
only
entered
three
or
four
times
a
year
i
should
have
liked
the
stable
quite
as
well
said
the
man
abruptly
thenardier
pretended
not
to
hear
this
unamiable
remark
he
lighted
two
perfectly
fresh
wax
candles
which
figured
on
the
chimney
piece
a
very
good
fire
was
flickering
on
the
hearth
on
the
chimney
piece
under
a
glass
globe
stood
a
woman
s
head
dress
in
silver
wire
and
orange
flowers
and
what
is
this
resumed
the
stranger
that
sir
said
thenardier
is
my
wife
s
wedding
bonnet
the
traveller
surveyed
the
object
with
a
glance
which
seemed
to
say
there
really
was
a
time
then
when
that
monster
was
a
maiden
thenardier
lied
however
when
he
had
leased
this
paltry
building
for
the
purpose
of
converting
it
into
a
tavern
he
had
found
this
chamber
decorated
in
just
this
manner
and
had
purchased
the
furniture
and
obtained
the
orange
flowers
at
second
hand
with
the
idea
that
this
would
cast
a
graceful
shadow
on
his
spouse
and
would
result
in
what
the
english
call
respectability
for
his
house
when
the
traveller
turned
round
the
host
had
disappeared
thenardier
had
withdrawn
discreetly
without
venturing
to
wish
him
a
good
night
as
he
did
not
wish
to
treat
with
disrespectful
cordiality
a
man
whom
he
proposed
to
fleece
royally
the
following
morning
the
inn
keeper
retired
to
his
room
his
wife
was
in
bed
but
she
was
not
asleep
when
she
heard
her
husband
s
step
she
turned
over
and
said
to
him
do
you
know
i
m
going
to
turn
cosette
out
of
doors
to
morrow
thenardier
replied
coldly
how
you
do
go
on
they
exchanged
no
further
words
and
a
few
moments
later
their
candle
was
extinguished
as
for
the
traveller
he
had
deposited
his
cudgel
and
his
bundle
in
a
corner
the
landlord
once
gone
he
threw
himself
into
an
arm
chair
and
remained
for
some
time
buried
in
thought
then
he
removed
his
shoes
took
one
of
the
two
candles
blew
out
the
other
opened
the
door
and
quitted
the
room
gazing
about
him
like
a
person
who
is
in
search
of
something
he
traversed
a
corridor
and
came
upon
a
staircase
there
he
heard
a
very
faint
and
gentle
sound
like
the
breathing
of
a
child
he
followed
this
sound
and
came
to
a
sort
of
triangular
recess
built
under
the
staircase
or
rather
formed
by
the
staircase
itself
this
recess
was
nothing
else
than
the
space
under
the
steps
there
in
the
midst
of
all
sorts
of
old
papers
and
potsherds
among
dust
and
spiders
webs
was
a
bed
if
one
can
call
by
the
name
of
bed
a
straw
pallet
so
full
of
holes
as
to
display
the
straw
and
a
coverlet
so
tattered
as
to
show
the
pallet
no
sheets
this
was
placed
on
the
floor
in
this
bed
cosette
was
sleeping
the
man
approached
and
gazed
down
upon
her
cosette
was
in
a
profound
sleep
she
was
fully
dressed
in
the
winter
she
did
not
undress
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
so
cold
against
her
breast
was
pressed
the
doll
whose
large
eyes
wide
open
glittered
in
the
dark
from
time
to
time
she
gave
vent
to
a
deep
sigh
as
though
she
were
on
the
point
of
waking
and
she
strained
the
doll
almost
convulsively
in
her
arms
beside
her
bed
there
was
only
one
of
her
wooden
shoes
a
door
which
stood
open
near
cosette
s
pallet
permitted
a
view
of
a
rather
large
dark
room
the
stranger
stepped
into
it
at
the
further
extremity
through
a
glass
door
he
saw
two
small
very
white
beds
they
belonged
to
eponine
and
azelma
behind
these
beds
and
half
hidden
stood
an
uncurtained
wicker
cradle
in
which
the
little
boy
who
had
cried
all
the
evening
lay
asleep
the
stranger
conjectured
that
this
chamber
connected
with
that
of
the
thenardier
pair
he
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
when
his
eye
fell
upon
the
fireplace
one
of
those
vast
tavern
chimneys
where
there
is
always
so
little
fire
when
there
is
any
fire
at
all
and
which
are
so
cold
to
look
at
there
was
no
fire
in
this
one
there
was
not
even
ashes
but
there
was
something
which
attracted
the
stranger
s
gaze
nevertheless
it
was
two
tiny
children
s
shoes
coquettish
in
shape
and
unequal
in
size
the
traveller
recalled
the
graceful
and
immemorial
custom
in
accordance
with
which
children
place
their
shoes
in
the
chimney
on
christmas
eve
there
to
await
in
the
darkness
some
sparkling
gift
from
their
good
fairy
eponine
and
azelma
had
taken
care
not
to
omit
this
and
each
of
them
had
set
one
of
her
shoes
on
the
hearth
the
traveller
bent
over
them
the
fairy
that
is
to
say
their
mother
had
already
paid
her
visit
and
in
each
he
saw
a
brand
new
and
shining
ten
sou
piece
the
man
straightened
himself
up
and
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
when
far
in
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
hearth
he
caught
sight
of
another
object
he
looked
at
it
and
recognized
a
wooden
shoe
a
frightful
shoe
of
the
coarsest
description
half
dilapidated
and
all
covered
with
ashes
and
dried
mud
it
was
cosette
s
sabot
cosette
with
that
touching
trust
of
childhood
which
can
always
be
deceived
yet
never
discouraged
had
placed
her
shoe
on
the
hearth
stone
also
hope
in
a
child
who
has
never
known
anything
but
despair
is
a
sweet
and
touching
thing
there
was
nothing
in
this
wooden
shoe
the
stranger
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
bent
over
and
placed
a
louis
d
or
in
cosette
s
shoe
then
he
regained
his
own
chamber
with
the
stealthy
tread
of
a
wolf
chapter
ix
thenardier
and
his
manoeuvres
on
the
following
morning
two
hours
at
least
before
day
break
thenardier
seated
beside
a
candle
in
the
public
room
of
the
tavern
pen
in
hand
was
making
out
the
bill
for
the
traveller
with
the
yellow
coat
his
wife
standing
beside
him
and
half
bent
over
him
was
following
him
with
her
eyes
they
exchanged
not
a
word
on
the
one
hand
there
was
profound
meditation
on
the
other
the
religious
admiration
with
which
one
watches
the
birth
and
development
of
a
marvel
of
the
human
mind
a
noise
was
audible
in
the
house
it
was
the
lark
sweeping
the
stairs
after
the
lapse
of
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
and
some
erasures
thenardier
produced
the
following
masterpiece
bill
of
the
gentleman
in
no
1
supper
3
francs
chamber
10
candle
5
fire
4

1
total
23
francs
service
was
written
servisse
twenty
three
francs
cried
the
woman
with
an
enthusiasm
which
was
mingled
with
some
hesitation
like
all
great
artists
thenardier
was
dissatisfied
peuh
he
exclaimed
it
was
the
accent
of
castlereagh
auditing
france
s
bill
at
the
congress
of
vienna
monsieur
thenardier
you
are
right
he
certainly
owes
that
murmured
the
wife
who
was
thinking
of
the
doll
bestowed
on
cosette
in
the
presence
of
her
daughters
it
is
just
but
it
is
too
much
he
will
not
pay
it
thenardier
laughed
coldly
as
usual
and
said
he
will
pay
this
laugh
was
the
supreme
assertion
of
certainty
and
authority
that
which
was
asserted
in
this
manner
must
needs
be
so
his
wife
did
not
insist
she
set
about
arranging
the
table
her
husband
paced
the
room
a
moment
later
he
added
i
owe
full
fifteen
hundred
francs
he
went
and
seated
himself
in
the
chimney
corner
meditating
with
his
feet
among
the
warm
ashes
ah
by
the
way
resumed
his
wife
you
don
t
forget
that
i
m
going
to
turn
cosette
out
of
doors
to
day
the
monster
she
breaks
my
heart
with
that
doll
of
hers
i
d
rather
marry
louis
xviii
than
keep
her
another
day
in
the
house
thenardier
lighted
his
pipe
and
replied
between
two
puffs
you
will
hand
that
bill
to
the
man
then
he
went
out
hardly
had
he
left
the
room
when
the
traveller
entered
thenardier
instantly
reappeared
behind
him
and
remained
motionless
in
the
half
open
door
visible
only
to
his
wife
the
yellow
man
carried
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
in
his
hand
up
so
early
said
madame
thenardier
is
monsieur
leaving
us
already
as
she
spoke
thus
she
was
twisting
the
bill
about
in
her
hands
with
an
embarrassed
air
and
making
creases
in
it
with
her
nails
her
hard
face
presented
a
shade
which
was
not
habitual
with
it
timidity
and
scruples
to
present
such
a
bill
to
a
man
who
had
so
completely
the
air
of
a
poor
wretch
seemed
difficult
to
her
the
traveller
appeared
to
be
preoccupied
and
absent
minded
he
replied
yes
madame
i
am
going
so
monsieur
has
no
business
in
montfermeil
no
i
was
passing
through
that
is
all
what
do
i
owe
you
madame
he
added
the
thenardier
silently
handed
him
the
folded
bill
the
man
unfolded
the
paper
and
glanced
at
it
but
his
thoughts
were
evidently
elsewhere
madame
he
resumed
is
business
good
here
in
montfermeil
so
so
monsieur
replied
the
thenardier
stupefied
at
not
witnessing
another
sort
of
explosion
she
continued
in
a
dreary
and
lamentable
tone
oh
monsieur
times
are
so
hard
and
then
we
have
so
few
bourgeois
in
the
neighborhood
all
the
people
are
poor
you
see
if
we
had
not
now
and
then
some
rich
and
generous
travellers
like
monsieur
we
should
not
get
along
at
all
we
have
so
many
expenses
just
see
that
child
is
costing
us
our
very
eyes
what
child
why
the
little
one
you
know
cosette
the
lark
as
she
is
called
hereabouts
ah
said
the
man
she
went
on
how
stupid
these
peasants
are
with
their
nicknames
she
has
more
the
air
of
a
bat
than
of
a
lark
you
see
sir
we
do
not
ask
charity
and
we
cannot
bestow
it
we
earn
nothing
and
we
have
to
pay
out
a
great
deal
the
license
the
imposts
the
door
and
window
tax
the
hundredths
monsieur
is
aware
that
the
government
demands
a
terrible
deal
of
money
and
then
i
have
my
daughters
i
have
no
need
to
bring
up
other
people
s
children
the
man
resumed
in
that
voice
which
he
strove
to
render
indifferent
and
in
which
there
lingered
a
tremor
what
if
one
were
to
rid
you
of
her
who
cosette
yes
the
landlady
s
red
and
violent
face
brightened
up
hideously
ah
sir
my
dear
sir
take
her
keep
her
lead
her
off
carry
her
away
sugar
her
stuff
her
with
truffles
drink
her
eat
her
and
the
blessings
of
the
good
holy
virgin
and
of
all
the
saints
of
paradise
be
upon
you
agreed
really
you
will
take
her
away
i
will
take
her
away
immediately
immediately
call
the
child
cosette
screamed
the
thenardier
in
the
meantime
pursued
the
man
i
will
pay
you
what
i
owe
you
how
much
is
it
he
cast
a
glance
on
the
bill
and
could
not
restrain
a
start
of
surprise
twenty
three
francs
he
looked
at
the
landlady
and
repeated
twenty
three
francs
there
was
in
the
enunciation
of
these
words
thus
repeated
an
accent
between
an
exclamation
and
an
interrogation
point
the
thenardier
had
had
time
to
prepare
herself
for
the
shock
she
replied
with
assurance
good
gracious
yes
sir
it
is
twenty
three
francs
the
stranger
laid
five
five
franc
pieces
on
the
table
go
and
get
the
child
said
he
at
that
moment
thenardier
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
said
monsieur
owes
twenty
six
sous
twenty
six
sous
exclaimed
his
wife
twenty
sous
for
the
chamber
resumed
thenardier
coldly
and
six
sous
for
his
supper
as
for
the
child
i
must
discuss
that
matter
a
little
with
the
gentleman
leave
us
wife
madame
thenardier
was
dazzled
as
with
the
shock
caused
by
unexpected
lightning
flashes
of
talent
she
was
conscious
that
a
great
actor
was
making
his
entrance
on
the
stage
uttered
not
a
word
in
reply
and
left
the
room
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
thenardier
offered
the
traveller
a
chair
the
traveller
seated
himself
thenardier
remained
standing
and
his
face
assumed
a
singular
expression
of
good
fellowship
and
simplicity
sir
said
he
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
this
that
i
adore
that
child
the
stranger
gazed
intently
at
him
what
child
thenardier
continued
how
strange
it
is
one
grows
attached
what
money
is
that
take
back
your
hundred
sou
piece
i
adore
the
child
whom
do
you
mean
demanded
the
stranger
eh
our
little
cosette
are
you
not
intending
to
take
her
away
from
us
well
i
speak
frankly
as
true
as
you
are
an
honest
man
i
will
not
consent
to
it
i
shall
miss
that
child
i
saw
her
first
when
she
was
a
tiny
thing
it
is
true
that
she
costs
us
money
it
is
true
that
she
has
her
faults
it
is
true
that
we
are
not
rich
it
is
true
that
i
have
paid
out
over
four
hundred
francs
for
drugs
for
just
one
of
her
illnesses
but
one
must
do
something
for
the
good
god
s
sake
she
has
neither
father
nor
mother
i
have
brought
her
up
i
have
bread
enough
for
her
and
for
myself
in
truth
i
think
a
great
deal
of
that
child
you
understand
one
conceives
an
affection
for
a
person
i
am
a
good
sort
of
a
beast
i
am
i
do
not
reason
i
love
that
little
girl
my
wife
is
quick
tempered
but
she
loves
her
also
you
see
she
is
just
the
same
as
our
own
child
i
want
to
keep
her
to
babble
about
the
house
the
stranger
kept
his
eye
intently
fixed
on
thenardier
the
latter
continued
excuse
me
sir
but
one
does
not
give
away
one
s
child
to
a
passer
by
like
that
i
am
right
am
i
not
still
i
don
t
say
you
are
rich
you
have
the
air
of
a
very
good
man
if
it
were
for
her
happiness
but
one
must
find
out
that
you
understand
suppose
that
i
were
to
let
her
go
and
to
sacrifice
myself
i
should
like
to
know
what
becomes
of
her
i
should
not
wish
to
lose
sight
of
her
i
should
like
to
know
with
whom
she
is
living
so
that
i
could
go
to
see
her
from
time
to
time
so
that
she
may
know
that
her
good
foster
father
is
alive
that
he
is
watching
over
her
in
short
there
are
things
which
are
not
possible
i
do
not
even
know
your
name
if
you
were
to
take
her
away
i
should
say
well
and
the
lark
what
has
become
of
her
one
must
at
least
see
some
petty
scrap
of
paper
some
trifle
in
the
way
of
a
passport
you
know
the
stranger
still
surveying
him
with
that
gaze
which
penetrates
as
the
saying
goes
to
the
very
depths
of
the
conscience
replied
in
a
grave
firm
voice
monsieur
thenardier
one
does
not
require
a
passport
to
travel
five
leagues
from
paris
if
i
take
cosette
away
i
shall
take
her
away
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
you
will
not
know
my
name
you
will
not
know
my
residence
you
will
not
know
where
she
is
and
my
intention
is
that
she
shall
never
set
eyes
on
you
again
so
long
as
she
lives
i
break
the
thread
which
binds
her
foot
and
she
departs
does
that
suit
you
yes
or
no
since
geniuses
like
demons
recognize
the
presence
of
a
superior
god
by
certain
signs
thenardier
comprehended
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
very
strong
person
it
was
like
an
intuition
he
comprehended
it
with
his
clear
and
sagacious
promptitude
while
drinking
with
the
carters
smoking
and
singing
coarse
songs
on
the
preceding
evening
he
had
devoted
the
whole
of
the
time
to
observing
the
stranger
watching
him
like
a
cat
and
studying
him
like
a
mathematician
he
had
watched
him
both
on
his
own
account
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
and
through
instinct
and
had
spied
upon
him
as
though
he
had
been
paid
for
so
doing
not
a
movement
not
a
gesture
on
the
part
of
the
man
in
the
yellow
great
coat
had
escaped
him
even
before
the
stranger
had
so
clearly
manifested
his
interest
in
cosette
thenardier
had
divined
his
purpose
he
had
caught
the
old
man
s
deep
glances
returning
constantly
to
the
child
who
was
this
man
why
this
interest
why
this
hideous
costume
when
he
had
so
much
money
in
his
purse
questions
which
he
put
to
himself
without
being
able
to
solve
them
and
which
irritated
him
he
had
pondered
it
all
night
long
he
could
not
be
cosette
s
father
was
he
her
grandfather
then
why
not
make
himself
known
at
once
when
one
has
a
right
one
asserts
it
this
man
evidently
had
no
right
over
cosette
what
was
it
then
thenardier
lost
himself
in
conjectures
he
caught
glimpses
of
everything
but
he
saw
nothing
be
that
as
it
may
on
entering
into
conversation
with
the
man
sure
that
there
was
some
secret
in
the
case
that
the
latter
had
some
interest
in
remaining
in
the
shadow
he
felt
himself
strong
when
he
perceived
from
the
stranger
s
clear
and
firm
retort
that
this
mysterious
personage
was
mysterious
in
so
simple
a
way
he
became
conscious
that
he
was
weak
he
had
expected
nothing
of
the
sort
his
conjectures
were
put
to
the
rout
he
rallied
his
ideas
he
weighed
everything
in
the
space
of
a
second
thenardier
was
one
of
those
men
who
take
in
a
situation
at
a
glance
he
decided
that
the
moment
had
arrived
for
proceeding
straightforward
and
quickly
at
that
he
did
as
great
leaders
do
at
the
decisive
moment
which
they
know
that
they
alone
recognize
he
abruptly
unmasked
his
batteries
sir
said
he
i
am
in
need
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
the
stranger
took
from
his
side
pocket
an
old
pocketbook
of
black
leather
opened
it
drew
out
three
bank
bills
which
he
laid
on
the
table
then
he
placed
his
large
thumb
on
the
notes
and
said
to
the
inn
keeper
go
and
fetch
cosette
while
this
was
taking
place
what
had
cosette
been
doing
on
waking
up
cosette
had
run
to
get
her
shoe
in
it
she
had
found
the
gold
piece
it
was
not
a
napoleon
it
was
one
of
those
perfectly
new
twenty
franc
pieces
of
the
restoration
on
whose
effigy
the
little
prussian
queue
had
replaced
the
laurel
wreath
cosette
was
dazzled
her
destiny
began
to
intoxicate
her
she
did
not
know
what
a
gold
piece
was
she
had
never
seen
one
she
hid
it
quickly
in
her
pocket
as
though
she
had
stolen
it
still
she
felt
that
it
really
was
hers
she
guessed
whence
her
gift
had
come
but
the
joy
which
she
experienced
was
full
of
fear
she
was
happy
above
all
she
was
stupefied
such
magnificent
and
beautiful
things
did
not
appear
real
the
doll
frightened
her
the
gold
piece
frightened
her
she
trembled
vaguely
in
the
presence
of
this
magnificence
the
stranger
alone
did
not
frighten
her
on
the
contrary
he
reassured
her
ever
since
the
preceding
evening
amid
all
her
amazement
even
in
her
sleep
she
had
been
thinking
in
her
little
childish
mind
of
that
man
who
seemed
to
be
so
poor
and
so
sad
and
who
was
so
rich
and
so
kind
everything
had
changed
for
her
since
she
had
met
that
good
man
in
the
forest
cosette
less
happy
than
the
most
insignificant
swallow
of
heaven
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
take
refuge
under
a
mother
s
shadow
and
under
a
wing
for
the
last
five
years
that
is
to
say
as
far
back
as
her
memory
ran
the
poor
child
had
shivered
and
trembled
she
had
always
been
exposed
completely
naked
to
the
sharp
wind
of
adversity
now
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
clothed
formerly
her
soul
had
seemed
cold
now
it
was
warm
cosette
was
no
longer
afraid
of
the
thenardier
she
was
no
longer
alone
there
was
some
one
there
she
hastily
set
about
her
regular
morning
duties
that
louis
which
she
had
about
her
in
the
very
apron
pocket
whence
the
fifteen
sou
piece
had
fallen
on
the
night
before
distracted
her
thoughts
she
dared
not
touch
it
but
she
spent
five
minutes
in
gazing
at
it
with
her
tongue
hanging
out
if
the
truth
must
be
told
as
she
swept
the
staircase
she
paused
remained
standing
there
motionless
forgetful
of
her
broom
and
of
the
entire
universe
occupied
in
gazing
at
that
star
which
was
blazing
at
the
bottom
of
her
pocket
it
was
during
one
of
these
periods
of
contemplation
that
the
thenardier
joined
her
she
had
gone
in
search
of
cosette
at
her
husband
s
orders
what
was
quite
unprecedented
she
neither
struck
her
nor
said
an
insulting
word
to
her
cosette
she
said
almost
gently
come
immediately
an
instant
later
cosette
entered
the
public
room
the
stranger
took
up
the
bundle
which
he
had
brought
and
untied
it
this
bundle
contained
a
little
woollen
gown
an
apron
a
fustian
bodice
a
kerchief
a
petticoat
woollen
stockings
shoes
a
complete
outfit
for
a
girl
of
seven
years
all
was
black
my
child
said
the
man
take
these
and
go
and
dress
yourself
quickly
daylight
was
appearing
when
those
of
the
inhabitants
of
montfermeil
who
had
begun
to
open
their
doors
beheld
a
poorly
clad
old
man
leading
a
little
girl
dressed
in
mourning
and
carrying
a
pink
doll
in
her
arms
pass
along
the
road
to
paris
they
were
going
in
the
direction
of
livry
it
was
our
man
and
cosette
no
one
knew
the
man
as
cosette
was
no
longer
in
rags
many
did
not
recognize
her
cosette
was
going
away
with
whom
she
did
not
know
whither
she
knew
not
all
that
she
understood
was
that
she
was
leaving
the
thenardier
tavern
behind
her
no
one
had
thought
of
bidding
her
farewell
nor
had
she
thought
of
taking
leave
of
any
one
she
was
leaving
that
hated
and
hating
house
poor
gentle
creature
whose
heart
had
been
repressed
up
to
that
hour
cosette
walked
along
gravely
with
her
large
eyes
wide
open
and
gazing
at
the
sky
she
had
put
her
louis
in
the
pocket
of
her
new
apron
from
time
to
time
she
bent
down
and
glanced
at
it
then
she
looked
at
the
good
man
she
felt
something
as
though
she
were
beside
the
good
god
chapter
x
he
who
seeks
to
better
himself
may
render
his
situation
worse
madame
thenardier
had
allowed
her
husband
to
have
his
own
way
as
was
her
wont
she
had
expected
great
results
when
the
man
and
cosette
had
taken
their
departure
thenardier
allowed
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
to
elapse
then
he
took
her
aside
and
showed
her
the
fifteen
hundred
francs
is
that
all
said
she
it
was
the
first
time
since
they
had
set
up
housekeeping
that
she
had
dared
to
criticise
one
of
the
master
s
acts
the
blow
told
you
are
right
in
sooth
said
he
i
am
a
fool
give
me
my
hat
he
folded
up
the
three
bank
bills
thrust
them
into
his
pocket
and
ran
out
in
all
haste
but
he
made
a
mistake
and
turned
to
the
right
first
some
neighbors
of
whom
he
made
inquiries
put
him
on
the
track
again
the
lark
and
the
man
had
been
seen
going
in
the
direction
of
livry
he
followed
these
hints
walking
with
great
strides
and
talking
to
himself
the
while
that
man
is
evidently
a
million
dressed
in
yellow
and
i
am
an
animal
first
he
gave
twenty
sous
then
five
francs
then
fifty
francs
then
fifteen
hundred
francs
all
with
equal
readiness
he
would
have
given
fifteen
thousand
francs
but
i
shall
overtake
him
and
then
that
bundle
of
clothes
prepared
beforehand
for
the
child
all
that
was
singular
many
mysteries
lay
concealed
under
it
one
does
not
let
mysteries
out
of
one
s
hand
when
one
has
once
grasped
them
the
secrets
of
the
wealthy
are
sponges
of
gold
one
must
know
how
to
subject
them
to
pressure
all
these
thoughts
whirled
through
his
brain
i
am
an
animal
said
he
when
one
leaves
montfermeil
and
reaches
the
turn
which
the
road
takes
that
runs
to
livry
it
can
be
seen
stretching
out
before
one
to
a
great
distance
across
the
plateau
on
arriving
there
he
calculated
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
see
the
old
man
and
the
child
he
looked
as
far
as
his
vision
reached
and
saw
nothing
he
made
fresh
inquiries
but
he
had
wasted
time
some
passers
by
informed
him
that
the
man
and
child
of
whom
he
was
in
search
had
gone
towards
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
gagny
he
hastened
in
that
direction
they
were
far
in
advance
of
him
but
a
child
walks
slowly
and
he
walked
fast
and
then
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
country
all
at
once
he
paused
and
dealt
himself
a
blow
on
his
forehead
like
a
man
who
has
forgotten
some
essential
point
and
who
is
ready
to
retrace
his
steps
i
ought
to
have
taken
my
gun
said
he
to
himself
thenardier
was
one
of
those
double
natures
which
sometimes
pass
through
our
midst
without
our
being
aware
of
the
fact
and
who
disappear
without
our
finding
them
out
because
destiny
has
only
exhibited
one
side
of
them
it
is
the
fate
of
many
men
to
live
thus
half
submerged
in
a
calm
and
even
situation
thenardier
possessed
all
that
is
required
to
make
we
will
not
say
to
be
what
people
have
agreed
to
call
an
honest
trader
a
good
bourgeois
at
the
same
time
certain
circumstances
being
given
certain
shocks
arriving
to
bring
his
under
nature
to
the
surface
he
had
all
the
requisites
for
a
blackguard
he
was
a
shopkeeper
in
whom
there
was
some
taint
of
the
monster
satan
must
have
occasionally
crouched
down
in
some
corner
of
the
hovel
in
which
thenardier
dwelt
and
have
fallen
a
dreaming
in
the
presence
of
this
hideous
masterpiece
after
a
momentary
hesitation
bah
he
thought
they
will
have
time
to
make
their
escape
and
he
pursued
his
road
walking
rapidly
straight
ahead
and
with
almost
an
air
of
certainty
with
the
sagacity
of
a
fox
scenting
a
covey
of
partridges
in
truth
when
he
had
passed
the
ponds
and
had
traversed
in
an
oblique
direction
the
large
clearing
which
lies
on
the
right
of
the
avenue
de
bellevue
and
reached
that
turf
alley
which
nearly
makes
the
circuit
of
the
hill
and
covers
the
arch
of
the
ancient
aqueduct
of
the
abbey
of
chelles
he
caught
sight
over
the
top
of
the
brushwood
of
the
hat
on
which
he
had
already
erected
so
many
conjectures
it
was
that
man
s
hat
the
brushwood
was
not
high
thenardier
recognized
the
fact
that
the
man
and
cosette
were
sitting
there
the
child
could
not
be
seen
on
account
of
her
small
size
but
the
head
of
her
doll
was
visible
thenardier
was
not
mistaken
the
man
was
sitting
there
and
letting
cosette
get
somewhat
rested
the
inn
keeper
walked
round
the
brushwood
and
presented
himself
abruptly
to
the
eyes
of
those
whom
he
was
in
search
of
pardon
excuse
me
sir
he
said
quite
breathless
but
here
are
your
fifteen
hundred
francs
so
saying
he
handed
the
stranger
the
three
bank
bills
the
man
raised
his
eyes
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
thenardier
replied
respectfully
it
means
sir
that
i
shall
take
back
cosette
cosette
shuddered
and
pressed
close
to
the
old
man
he
replied
gazing
to
the
very
bottom
of
thenardier
s
eyes
the
while
and
enunciating
every
syllable
distinctly
you
are
go
ing
to
take
back
co
sette
yes
sir
i
am
i
will
tell
you
i
have
considered
the
matter
in
fact
i
have
not
the
right
to
give
her
to
you
i
am
an
honest
man
you
see
this
child
does
not
belong
to
me
she
belongs
to
her
mother
it
was
her
mother
who
confided
her
to
me
i
can
only
resign
her
to
her
mother
you
will
say
to
me
but
her
mother
is
dead
good
in
that
case
i
can
only
give
the
child
up
to
the
person
who
shall
bring
me
a
writing
signed
by
her
mother
to
the
effect
that
i
am
to
hand
the
child
over
to
the
person
therein
mentioned
that
is
clear
the
man
without
making
any
reply
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
thenardier
beheld
the
pocket
book
of
bank
bills
make
its
appearance
once
more
the
tavern
keeper
shivered
with
joy
good
thought
he
let
us
hold
firm
he
is
going
to
bribe
me
before
opening
the
pocket
book
the
traveller
cast
a
glance
about
him
the
spot
was
absolutely
deserted
there
was
not
a
soul
either
in
the
woods
or
in
the
valley
the
man
opened
his
pocket
book
once
more
and
drew
from
it
not
the
handful
of
bills
which
thenardier
expected
but
a
simple
little
paper
which
he
unfolded
and
presented
fully
open
to
the
inn
keeper
saying
you
are
right
read
thenardier
took
the
paper
and
read

monsieur
thenardier
you
will
deliver
cosette
to
this
person
you
will
be
paid
for
all
the
little
things
i
have
the
honor
to
salute
you
with
respect
fantine
you
know
that
signature
resumed
the
man
it
certainly
was
fantine
s
signature
thenardier
recognized
it
there
was
no
reply
to
make
he
experienced
two
violent
vexations
the
vexation
of
renouncing
the
bribery
which
he
had
hoped
for
and
the
vexation
of
being
beaten
the
man
added
you
may
keep
this
paper
as
your
receipt
thenardier
retreated
in
tolerably
good
order
this
signature
is
fairly
well
imitated
he
growled
between
his
teeth
however
let
it
go
then
he
essayed
a
desperate
effort
it
is
well
sir
he
said
since
you
are
the
person
but
i
must
be
paid
for
all
those
little
things
a
great
deal
is
owing
to
me
the
man
rose
to
his
feet
filliping
the
dust
from
his
thread
bare
sleeve
monsieur
thenardier
in
january
last
the
mother
reckoned
that
she
owed
you
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
in
february
you
sent
her
a
bill
of
five
hundred
francs
you
received
three
hundred
francs
at
the
end
of
february
and
three
hundred
francs
at
the
beginning
of
march
since
then
nine
months
have
elapsed
at
fifteen
francs
a
month
the
price
agreed
upon
which
makes
one
hundred
and
thirty
five
francs
you
had
received
one
hundred
francs
too
much
that
makes
thirty
five
still
owing
you
i
have
just
given
you
fifteen
hundred
francs
thenardier
s
sensations
were
those
of
the
wolf
at
the
moment
when
he
feels
himself
nipped
and
seized
by
the
steel
jaw
of
the
trap
who
is
this
devil
of
a
man
he
thought
he
did
what
the
wolf
does
he
shook
himself
audacity
had
succeeded
with
him
once
monsieur
i
don
t
know
your
name
he
said
resolutely
and
this
time
casting
aside
all
respectful
ceremony
i
shall
take
back
cosette
if
you
do
not
give
me
a
thousand
crowns
the
stranger
said
tranquilly
come
cosette
he
took
cosette
by
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
he
picked
up
his
cudgel
which
was
lying
on
the
ground
thenardier
noted
the
enormous
size
of
the
cudgel
and
the
solitude
of
the
spot
the
man
plunged
into
the
forest
with
the
child
leaving
the
inn
keeper
motionless
and
speechless
while
they
were
walking
away
thenardier
scrutinized
his
huge
shoulders
which
were
a
little
rounded
and
his
great
fists
then
bringing
his
eyes
back
to
his
own
person
they
fell
upon
his
feeble
arms
and
his
thin
hands
i
really
must
have
been
exceedingly
stupid
not
to
have
thought
to
bring
my
gun
he
said
to
himself
since
i
was
going
hunting
however
the
inn
keeper
did
not
give
up
i
want
to
know
where
he
is
going
said
he
and
he
set
out
to
follow
them
at
a
distance
two
things
were
left
on
his
hands
an
irony
in
the
shape
of
the
paper
signed
fantine
and
a
consolation
the
fifteen
hundred
francs
the
man
led
cosette
off
in
the
direction
of
livry
and
bondy
he
walked
slowly
with
drooping
head
in
an
attitude
of
reflection
and
sadness
the
winter
had
thinned
out
the
forest
so
that
thenardier
did
not
lose
them
from
sight
although
he
kept
at
a
good
distance
the
man
turned
round
from
time
to
time
and
looked
to
see
if
he
was
being
followed
all
at
once
he
caught
sight
of
thenardier
he
plunged
suddenly
into
the
brushwood
with
cosette
where
they
could
both
hide
themselves
the
deuce
said
thenardier
and
he
redoubled
his
pace
the
thickness
of
the
undergrowth
forced
him
to
draw
nearer
to
them
when
the
man
had
reached
the
densest
part
of
the
thicket
he
wheeled
round
it
was
in
vain
that
thenardier
sought
to
conceal
himself
in
the
branches
he
could
not
prevent
the
man
seeing
him
the
man
cast
upon
him
an
uneasy
glance
then
elevated
his
head
and
continued
his
course
the
inn
keeper
set
out
again
in
pursuit
thus
they
continued
for
two
or
three
hundred
paces
all
at
once
the
man
turned
round
once
more
he
saw
the
inn
keeper
this
time
he
gazed
at
him
with
so
sombre
an
air
that
thenardier
decided
that
it
was
useless
to
proceed
further
thenardier
retraced
his
steps

jean

not
dead
when
he
fell
into
the
sea
or
rather
when
he
threw
himself
into
it
he
was
not
ironed
as
we
have
seen
he
swam
under
water
until
he
reached
a
vessel
at
anchor
to
which
a
boat
was
moored
he
found
means
of
hiding
himself
in
this
boat
until
night
at
night
he
swam
off
again
and
reached
the
shore
a
little
way
from
cape
brun
there
as
he
did
not
lack
money
he
procured
clothing
a
small
country
house
in
the
neighborhood
of
balaguier
was
at
that
time
the
dressing
room
of
escaped
convicts
a
lucrative
specialty
then
jean
valjean
like
all
the
sorry
fugitives
who
are
seeking
to
evade
the
vigilance
of
the
law
and
social
fatality
pursued
an
obscure
and
undulating
itinerary
he
found
his
first
refuge
at
pradeaux
near
beausset
then
he
directed
his
course
towards
grand
villard
near
briancon
in
the
hautes
alpes
it
was
a
fumbling
and
uneasy
flight
a
mole

whose
branchings
are
untraceable
later
on
some
trace
of
his
passage
into

he
reached
paris
we
have
just
seen
him
at
montfermeil
his
first
care
on
arriving
in
paris
had
been
to
buy
mourning
clothes
for
a
little
girl
of
from
seven
to
eight
years
of
age
then
to
procure
a
lodging
that
done
he
had
betaken
himself
to
montfermeil
it
will
be
remembered
that
already
during
his
preceding
escape
he
had
made
a
mysterious
trip
thither
or
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
of
which
the
law
had
gathered
an
inkling
however
he
was
thought
to
be
dead
and
this
still
further
increased
the
obscurity
which
had
gathered
about
him
at
paris
one
of
the
journals
which
chronicled
the
fact
fell
into
his
hands
he
felt
reassured
and
almost
at
peace
as
though
he
had
really
been
dead
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
jean
valjean
rescued
cosette
from
the
claws
of
the
thenardiers
he
returned
to
paris
he
re
entered
it
at
nightfall
with
the
child
by
way
of
the
barrier
monceaux
there
he
entered
a
cabriolet
which
took
him
to
the
esplanade
of
the
observatoire
there
he
got
out
paid
the
coachman
took
cosette
by
the
hand
and
together
they
directed
their
steps
through
the
darkness
through
the
deserted
streets
which
adjoin
the
ourcine
and
the
glaciere
towards
the
boulevard
de

the
day
had
been
strange
and
filled
with
emotions
for
cosette
they
had
eaten
some
bread
and
cheese
purchased
in
isolated
taverns
behind
hedges
they
had
changed
carriages
frequently
they
had
travelled
short
distances
on
foot
she
made
no
complaint
but
she
was
weary
and
jean
valjean
perceived
it
by
the
way
she
dragged
more
and
more
on
his
hand
as
she
walked
he
took
her
on
his
back

i
master
gorbeau
forty
years
ago
a
rambler
who
had
ventured
into
that
unknown
country
of
the
salpetriere
and
who
had
mounted
to
the
barriere
d
italie
by
way
of
the
boulevard
reached
a
point
where
it
might
be
said
that
paris
disappeared
it
was
no
longer
solitude
for
there
were
passers
by
it
was
not
the
country
for
there
were
houses
and
streets
it
was
not
the
city
for
the
streets
had
ruts
like
highways
and
the
grass
grew
in
them
it
was
not
a
village
the
houses
were
too
lofty
what
was
it
then
it
was
an
inhabited
spot
where
there
was
no
one
it
was
a
desert
place
where
there
was
some
one
it
was
a
boulevard
of
the
great
city
a
street
of
paris
more
wild
at
night
than
the
forest
more
gloomy
by
day
than
a
cemetery
it
was
the
old
quarter
of
the
marche
aux
chevaux
the
rambler
if
he
risked
himself
outside
the
four
decrepit
walls
of
this
marche
aux
chevaux
if
he
consented
even
to
pass
beyond
the
rue
du
petit
banquier
after
leaving
on
his
right
a
garden
protected
by
high
walls
then
a
field
in
which
tan
bark
mills
rose
like
gigantic
beaver
huts
then
an
enclosure
encumbered
with
timber
with
a
heap
of
stumps
sawdust
and
shavings
on
which
stood
a
large
dog
barking
then
a
long
low
utterly
dilapidated
wall
with
a
little
black
door
in
mourning
laden
with
mosses
which
were
covered
with
flowers
in
the
spring
then
in
the
most
deserted
spot
a
frightful
and
decrepit
building
on
which
ran
the
inscription
in
large
letters
post
no
bills
this
daring
rambler
would
have
reached
little
known
latitudes
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
vignes
saint
marcel
there
near
a
factory
and
between
two
garden
walls
there
could
be
seen
at
that
epoch
a
mean
building
which
at
the
first
glance
seemed
as
small
as
a
thatched
hovel
and
which
was
in
reality
as
large
as
a
cathedral
it
presented
its
side
and
gable
to
the
public
road
hence
its
apparent
diminutiveness
nearly
the
whole
of
the
house
was
hidden
only
the
door
and
one
window
could
be
seen
this
hovel
was
only
one
story
high
the
first
detail
that
struck
the
observer
was
that
the
door
could
never
have
been
anything
but
the
door
of
a
hovel
while
the
window
if
it
had
been
carved
out
of
dressed
stone
instead
of
being
in
rough
masonry
might
have
been
the
lattice
of
a
lordly
mansion
the
door
was
nothing
but
a
collection
of
worm
eaten
planks
roughly
bound
together
by
cross
beams
which
resembled
roughly
hewn
logs
it
opened
directly
on
a
steep
staircase
of
lofty
steps
muddy
chalky
plaster
stained
dusty
steps
of
the
same
width
as
itself
which
could
be
seen
from
the
street
running
straight
up
like
a
ladder
and
disappearing
in
the
darkness
between
two
walls
the
top
of
the
shapeless
bay
into
which
this
door
shut
was
masked
by
a
narrow
scantling
in
the
centre
of
which
a
triangular
hole
had
been
sawed
which
served
both
as
wicket
and
air
hole
when
the
door
was
closed
on
the
inside
of
the
door
the
figures
52
had
been
traced
with
a
couple
of
strokes
of
a
brush
dipped
in
ink
and
above
the
scantling
the
same
hand
had
daubed
the
number
50
so
that
one
hesitated
where
was
one
above
the
door
it
said
number
50
the
inside
replied
no
number
52
no
one
knows
what
dust
colored
figures
were
suspended
like
draperies
from
the
triangular
opening
the
window
was
large
sufficiently
elevated
garnished
with
venetian
blinds
and
with
a
frame
in
large
square
panes
only
these
large
panes
were
suffering
from
various
wounds
which
were
both
concealed
and
betrayed
by
an
ingenious
paper
bandage
and
the
blinds
dislocated
and
unpasted
threatened
passers
by
rather
than
screened
the
occupants
the
horizontal
slats
were
missing
here
and
there
and
had
been
naively
replaced
with
boards
nailed
on
perpendicularly
so
that
what
began
as
a
blind
ended
as
a
shutter
this
door
with
an
unclean
and
this
window
with
an
honest
though
dilapidated
air
thus
beheld
on
the
same
house
produced
the
effect
of
two
incomplete
beggars
walking
side
by
side
with
different
miens
beneath
the
same
rags
the
one
having
always
been
a
mendicant
and
the
other
having
once
been
a
gentleman
the
staircase
led
to
a
very
vast
edifice
which
resembled
a
shed
which
had
been
converted
into
a
house
this
edifice
had
for
its
intestinal
tube
a
long
corridor
on
which
opened
to
right
and
left
sorts
of
compartments
of
varied
dimensions
which
were
inhabitable
under
stress
of
circumstances
and
rather
more
like
stalls
than
cells
these
chambers
received
their
light
from
the
vague
waste
grounds
in
the
neighborhood
all
this
was
dark
disagreeable
wan
melancholy
sepulchral
traversed
according
as
the
crevices
lay
in
the
roof
or
in
the
door
by
cold
rays
or
by
icy
winds
an
interesting
and
picturesque
peculiarity
of
this
sort
of
dwelling
is
the
enormous
size
of
the
spiders
to
the
left
of
the
entrance
door
on
the
boulevard
side
at
about
the
height
of
a
man
from
the
ground
a
small
window
which
had
been
walled
up
formed
a
square
niche
full
of
stones
which
the
children
had
thrown
there
as
they
passed
by
a
portion
of
this
building
has
recently
been
demolished
from
what
still
remains
of
it
one
can
form
a
judgment
as
to
what
it
was
in
former
days
as
a
whole
it
was
not
over
a
hundred
years
old
a
hundred
years
is
youth
in
a
church
and
age
in
a
house
it
seems
as
though
man
s
lodging
partook
of
his
ephemeral
character
and
god
s
house
of
his
eternity
the
postmen
called
the
house
number
50
52
but
it
was
known
in
the
neighborhood
as
the
gorbeau
house
let
us
explain
whence
this
appellation
was
derived
collectors
of
petty
details
who
become
herbalists
of
anecdotes
and
prick
slippery
dates
into
their
memories
with
a
pin
know
that
there
was
in
paris
during
the
last
century
about
1770
two
attorneys
at
the
chatelet
named
one
corbeau
raven
the
other
renard
fox
the
two
names
had
been
forestalled
by
la
fontaine
the
opportunity
was
too
fine
for
the
lawyers
they

put
in

in

the
two

embarrassed
by

jests
and
finding
the
bearing
of
their
heads
interfered
with
by
the
shouts
of
laughter
which
followed
them
resolved
to
get
rid
of
their
names
and
hit
upon
the
expedient
of
applying
to
the
king
their
petition
was
presented
to
louis
xv
on
the
same
day
when
the
papal
nuncio
on
the
one
hand
and
the
cardinal
de
la
roche
aymon
on
the
other
both
devoutly
kneeling
were
each
engaged
in
putting
on
in
his
majesty

presence
a
slipper
on
the
bare
feet
of
madame

had
just
got
out

who
was
laughing
continued
to
laugh
passed
gayly
from
the
two
bishops
to
the
two
lawyers
and
bestowed
on
these
limbs
of
the
law
their
former
names
or
nearly
so
by
the
kings
command
maitre
corbeau
was
permitted
to
add
a
tail
to
his
initial
letter
and
to
call
himself
gorbeau
maitre
renard
was
less
lucky
all
he
obtained
was
leave
to
place
a
p
in
front
of
his
r
and
to
call
himself
prenard
so
that
the
second
name
bore
almost
as
much
resemblance
as
the
first
now
according
to
local
tradition
this
maitre
gorbeau
had
been
the
proprietor
of
the
building
numbered
50
52
on
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
he
was
even
the
author
of
the
monumental
window
hence
the
edifice
bore
the
name
of
the
gorbeau
house
opposite
this
house
among
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
rose
a
great
elm
which
was
three
quarters
dead
almost
directly
facing
it
opens
the
rue
de
la
barriere
des
gobelins
a
street
then
without
houses
unpaved
planted
with
unhealthy
trees
which
was
green
or
muddy
according
to
the
season
and
which
ended
squarely
in
the
exterior
wall
of

an
odor
of
copperas
issued
in
puffs
from
the
roofs
of
the
neighboring
factory
the
barrier

close
at
hand
in
1823
the
city
wall
was
still
in

this
barrier
itself
evoked
gloomy
fancies
in
the
mind
it
was
the
road

under

it
was
there
that
about
1829
was
committed
that
mysterious
assassination
called
the
assassination
of
the
fontainebleau
barrier
whose
authors
justice
was
never
able
to
discover
a
melancholy
problem
which
has
never
been
elucidated
a
frightful
enigma
which
has
never
been
unriddled
take
a
few
steps
and
you
come
upon
that
fatal
rue
croulebarbe
where
ulbach
stabbed
the
goat
girl
of
ivry
to
the
sound
of
thunder
as
in
the
melodramas
a
few
paces
more
and
you
arrive
at
the
abominable
pollarded
elms
of
the
barriere
saint
jacques
that
expedient
of
the
philanthropist
to
conceal
the
scaffold
that
miserable
and
shameful
place
de
grove
of
a
shop
keeping
and
bourgeois
society
which
recoiled
before
the
death
penalty
neither
daring
to
abolish
it
with
grandeur
nor
to
uphold
it
with
authority
leaving
aside
this
place
saint
jacques
which
was
as
it
were
predestined
and
which
has
always
been
horrible
probably
the
most
mournful
spot
on
that
mournful
boulevard
seven
and
thirty
years
ago
was
the
spot
which
even
to
day
is
so
unattractive
where
stood
the
building
number
50
52
bourgeois
houses
only
began
to
spring
up
there
twenty
five
years
later
the
place
was
unpleasant
in
addition
to
the
gloomy
thoughts
which
assailed
one
there
one
was
conscious
of
being
between
the
salpetriere
a
glimpse
of
whose
dome
could
be
seen
and
bicetre
whose
outskirts
one
was
fairly
touching
that
is
to
say
between
the
madness
of
women
and
the
madness
of
men
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
one
could
perceive
nothing
but
the
abattoirs
the
city
wall
and
the
fronts
of
a
few
factories
resembling
barracks
or
monasteries
everywhere
about
stood
hovels
rubbish
ancient
walls
blackened
like
cerecloths
new
white
walls
like
winding
sheets
everywhere
parallel
rows
of
trees
buildings
erected
on
a
line
flat
constructions
long
cold
rows
and
the
melancholy
sadness
of
right
angles
not
an
unevenness
of
the
ground
not
a
caprice
in
the
architecture
not
a
fold
the
ensemble
was
glacial
regular
hideous
nothing
oppresses
the
heart
like
symmetry
it
is
because
symmetry
is
ennui
and
ennui
is
at
the
very
foundation
of
grief
despair
yawns
something
more
terrible
than
a
hell
where
one
suffers
may
be
imagined
and
that
is
a
hell
where
one
is
bored
if
such
a
hell
existed
that
bit
of
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
might
have
formed
the
entrance
to
it
nevertheless
at
nightfall
at
the
moment
when
the
daylight
is
vanishing
especially
in
winter
at
the
hour
when
the
twilight
breeze
tears
from
the
elms
their
last
russet
leaves
when
the
darkness
is
deep
and
starless
or
when
the
moon
and
the
wind
are
making
openings
in
the
clouds
and
losing
themselves
in
the
shadows
this
boulevard
suddenly
becomes
frightful
the
black
lines
sink
inwards
and
are
lost
in
the
shades
like
morsels
of
the
infinite
the
passer
by
cannot
refrain
from
recalling
the
innumerable
traditions
of
the
place
which
are
connected
with
the
gibbet
the
solitude
of
this
spot
where
so
many
crimes
have
been
committed
had
something
terrible
about
it
one
almost
had
a
presentiment
of
meeting
with
traps
in
that
darkness
all
the
confused
forms
of
the
darkness
seemed
suspicious
and
the
long
hollow
square
of
which
one
caught
a
glimpse
between
each
tree
seemed
graves
by
day
it
was
ugly
in
the
evening
melancholy
by
night
it
was
sinister
in
summer
at
twilight
one
saw
here
and
there
a
few
old
women
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
elm
on
benches
mouldy
with
rain
these
good
old
women
were
fond
of
begging
however
this
quarter
which
had
a
superannuated
rather
than
an
antique
air
was
tending
even
then
to
transformation
even
at
that
time
any
one
who
was
desirous
of
seeing
it
had
to
make
haste
each
day
some
detail
of
the
whole
effect
was
disappearing
for
the
last
twenty
years
the
station
of
the
orleans
railway
has
stood
beside
the
old
faubourg
and
distracted
it
as
it
does
to
day
wherever
it
is
placed
on
the
borders
of
a
capital
a
railway
station
is
the
death
of
a
suburb
and
the
birth
of
a
city
it
seems
as
though
around
these
great
centres
of
the
movements
of
a
people
the
earth
full
of
germs
trembled
and
yawned
to
engulf
the
ancient
dwellings
of
men
and
to
allow
new
ones
to
spring
forth
at
the
rattle
of
these
powerful
machines
at
the
breath
of
these
monstrous
horses
of
civilization
which
devour
coal
and
vomit
fire
the
old
houses
crumble
and
new
ones
rise
since
the
orleans
railway
has
invaded
the
region
of
the
salpetriere
the
ancient
narrow
streets
which
adjoin
the
moats
saint
victor
and
the
jardin
des
plantes
tremble
as
they
are
violently
traversed
three
or
four
times
each
day
by
those
currents
of
coach
fiacres
and
omnibuses
which
in
a
given
time
crowd
back
the
houses
to
the
right
and
the
left
for
there
are
things
which
are
odd
when
said
that
are
rigorously
exact
and
just
as
it
is
true
to
say
that
in
large
cities
the
sun
makes
the
southern
fronts
of
houses
to
vegetate
and
grow
it
is
certain
that
the
frequent
passage
of
vehicles
enlarges
streets
the
symptoms
of
a
new
life
are
evident
in
this
old
provincial
quarter
in
the
wildest
nooks
the
pavement
shows
itself
the
sidewalks
begin
to
crawl
and
to
grow
longer
even
where
there
are
as
yet
no
pedestrians
one
morning
a
memorable
morning
in
july
1845
black
pots
of
bitumen
were
seen
smoking
there
on
that
day
it
might
be
said
that
civilization
had
arrived
in
the
rue
de
l
ourcine
and
that
paris
had
entered
the
suburb
of
saint
marceau
chapter

a
nest
for
owl
and
a
warbler
it
was
in
front
of
this
gorbeau
house
that
jean
valjean
halted
like
wild
birds
he
had
chosen
this
desert
place
to
construct
his
nest
he
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
drew
out
a
sort
of
a
pass
key
opened
the
door
entered
closed
it
again
carefully
and
ascended
the
staircase
still
carrying
cosette
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
drew
from
his
pocket
another
key
with
which
he
opened
another
door
the
chamber
which
he
entered
and
which
he
closed
again
instantly
was
a
kind
of
moderately
spacious
attic
furnished
with
a
mattress
laid
on
the
floor
a
table
and
several
chairs
a
stove
in
which
a
fire
was
burning
and
whose
embers
were
visible
stood
in
one
corner
a
lantern
on
the
boulevard
cast
a
vague
light
into
this
poor
room
at
the
extreme
end
there
was
a
dressing
room
with
a
folding
bed
jean
valjean
carried
the
child
to
this
bed
and
laid
her
down
there
without
waking
her
he
struck
a
match
and
lighted
a
candle
all
this
was
prepared
beforehand
on
the
table
and
as
he
had
done
on
the
previous
evening
he
began
to
scrutinize
cosette
s
face
with
a
gaze
full
of
ecstasy
in
which
the
expression
of
kindness
and
tenderness
almost
amounted
to
aberration
the
little
girl
with
that
tranquil
confidence
which
belongs
only
to
extreme
strength
and
extreme
weakness
had
fallen
asleep
without
knowing
with
whom
she
was
and
continued
to
sleep
without
knowing
where
she
was
jean
valjean
bent
down
and
kissed
that
child
s
hand
nine
months
before
he
had
kissed
the
hand
of
the
mother
who
had
also
just
fallen
asleep
the
same
sad
piercing
religious
sentiment
filled
his
heart
he
knelt
beside
cosette
s
bed
lt
was
broad
daylight
and
the
child
still
slept
a
wan
ray
of
the
december
sun
penetrated
the
window
of
the
attic
and
lay
upon
the
ceiling
in
long
threads
of
light
and
shade
all
at
once
a
heavily
laden
carrier
s
cart
which
was
passing
along
the
boulevard
shook
the
frail
bed
like
a
clap
of
thunder
and
made
it
quiver
from
top
to
bottom
yes
madame
cried
cosette
waking
with
a
start
here
i
am
here
i
am
and
she
sprang
out
of
bed
her
eyes
still
half
shut
with
the
heaviness
of
sleep
extending
her
arms
towards
the
corner
of
the
wall
ah
mon
dieu
my
broom
said
she
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
now
and
beheld
the
smiling
countenance
of
jean
valjean
ah
so
it
is
true
said
the
child
good
morning
monsieur
children
accept
joy
and
happiness
instantly
and
familiarly
being
themselves
by
nature
joy
and
happiness
cosette
caught
sight
of
catherine
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
and
took
possession
of
her
and
as
she
played
she
put
a
hundred
questions
to
jean
valjean
where
was
she
was
paris
very
large
was
madame
thenardier
very
far
away
was
she
to
go
back
etc
etc
all
at
once
she
exclaimed
how
pretty
it
is
here
it
was
a
frightful
hole
but
she
felt
free
must
i
sweep
she
resumed
at
last
play
said
jean
valjean
the
day
passed
thus
cosette
without
troubling
herself
to
understand
anything
was
inexpressibly
happy
with
that
doll
and
that
kind
man
chapter
iii
two
misfortunes
make
one
piece
of
good
fortune
on
the
following
morning
at
daybreak
jean
valjean
was
still
by
cosette
s
bedside
he
watched
there
motionless
waiting
for
her
to
wake
some
new
thing
had
come
into
his
soul
jean
valjean
had
never
loved
anything
for
twenty
five
years
he
had
been
alone
in
the
world
he
had
never
been
father
lover
husband
friend
in
the
prison
he
had
been
vicious
gloomy
chaste
ignorant
and
shy
the
heart
of
that
ex
convict
was
full
of
virginity
his
sister
and
his
sister
s
children
had
left
him
only
a
vague
and
far
off
memory
which
had
finally
almost
completely
vanished
he
had
made
every
effort
to
find
them
and
not
having
been
able
to
find
them
he
had
forgotten
them
human
nature
is
made
thus
the
other
tender
emotions
of
his
youth
if
he
had
ever
had
any
had
fallen
into
an
abyss
when
he
saw
cosette
when
he
had
taken
possession
of
her
carried
her
off
and
delivered
her
he
felt
his
heart
moved
within
him
all
the
passion
and
affection
within
him
awoke
and
rushed
towards
that
child
he
approached
the
bed
where
she
lay
sleeping
and
trembled
with
joy
he
suffered
all
the
pangs
of
a
mother
and
he
knew
not
what
it
meant
for
that
great
and
singular
movement
of
a
heart
which
begins
to
love
is
a
very
obscure
and
a
very
sweet
thing
poor
old
man
with
a
perfectly
new
heart
only
as
he
was
five
and
fifty
and
cosette
eight
years
of
age
all
that
might
have
been
love
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
flowed
together
into
a
sort
of
ineffable
light
it
was
the
second
white
apparition
which
he
had
encountered
the
bishop
had
caused
the
dawn
of
virtue
to
rise
on
his
horizon
cosette
caused
the
dawn
of
love
to
rise
the
early
days
passed
in
this
dazzled
state
cosette
on
her
side
had
also
unknown
to
herself
become
another
being
poor
little
thing
she
was
so
little
when
her
mother
left
her
that
she
no
longer
remembered
her
like
all
children
who
resemble
young
shoots
of
the
vine
which
cling
to
everything
she
had
tried
to
love
she
had
not
succeeded
all
had
repulsed
her
the
thenardiers
their
children
other
children
she
had
loved
the
dog
and
he
had
died
after
which
nothing
and
nobody
would
have
anything
to
do
with
her
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
say
and
we
have
already
intimated
it
that
at
eight
years
of
age
her
heart
was
cold
it
was
not
her
fault
it
was
not
the
faculty
of
loving
that
she
lacked
alas
it
was
the
possibility
thus
from
the
very
first
day
all
her
sentient
and
thinking
powers
loved
this
kind
man
she
felt
that
which
she
had
never
felt
before
a
sensation
of
expansion
the
man
no
longer
produced
on
her
the
effect
of
being
old
or
poor
she
thought
jean
valjean
handsome
just
as
she
thought
the
hovel
pretty
these
are
the
effects
of
the
dawn
of
childhood
of
joy
the
novelty
of
the
earth
and
of
life
counts
for
something
here
nothing
is
so
charming
as
the
coloring
reflection
of
happiness
on
a
garret
we
all
have
in
our
past
a
delightful
garret
nature
a
difference
of
fifty
years
had
set
a
profound
gulf
between
jean
valjean
and
cosette
destiny
filled
in
this
gulf
destiny
suddenly
united
and
wedded
with
its
irresistible
power
these
two
uprooted
existences
differing
in
age
alike
in
sorrow
one
in
fact
completed
the
other
cosette
s
instinct
sought
a
father
as
jean
valjean
s
instinct
sought
a
child
to
meet
was
to
find
each
other
at
the
mysterious
moment
when
their
hands
touched
they
were
welded
together
when
these
two
souls
perceived
each
other
they
recognized
each
other
as
necessary
to
each
other
and
embraced
each
other
closely
taking
the
words
in
their
most
comprehensive
and
absolute
sense
we
may
say
that
separated
from
every
one
by
the
walls
of
the
tomb
jean
valjean
was
the
widower
and
cosette
was
the
orphan
this
situation
caused
jean
valjean
to
become
cosette
s
father
after
a
celestial
fashion
and
in
truth
the
mysterious
impression
produced
on
cosette
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
of
chelles
by
the
hand
of
jean
valjean
grasping
hers
in
the
dark
was
not
an
illusion
but
a
reality
the
entrance
of
that
man
into
the
destiny
of
that
child
had
been
the
advent
of
god
moreover
jean
valjean
had
chosen
his
refuge
well
there
he
seemed
perfectly
secure
the
chamber
with
a
dressing
room
which
he
occupied
with
cosette
was
the
one
whose
window
opened
on
the
boulevard
this
being
the
only
window
in
the
house
no
neighbors
glances
were
to
be
feared
from
across
the
way
or
at
the
side
the
ground
floor
of
number
50
52
a
sort
of
dilapidated
penthouse
served
as
a
wagon
house
for
market
gardeners
and
no
communication
existed
between
it
and
the
first
story
it
was
separated
by
the
flooring
which
had
neither
traps
nor
stairs
and
which
formed
the
diaphragm
of
the
building
as
it
were
the
first
story
contained
as
we
have
said
numerous
chambers
and
several
attics
only
one
of
which
was
occupied
by
the
old
woman
who
took
charge
of
jean
valjean
s
housekeeping
all
the
rest
was
uninhabited
it
was
this
old
woman
ornamented
with
the
name
of
the
principal
lodger
and
in
reality
intrusted
with
the
functions
of
portress
who
had
let
him
the
lodging
on
christmas
eve
he
had
represented
himself
to
her
as
a
gentleman
of
means
who
had
been
ruined
by
spanish
bonds
who
was
coming
there
to
live
with
his
little
daughter
he
had
paid
her
six
months
in
advance
and
had
commissioned
the
old
woman
to
furnish
the
chamber
and
dressing
room
as
we
have
seen
it
was
this
good
woman
who
had
lighted
the
fire
in
the
stove
and
prepared
everything
on
the
evening
of
their
arrival
week
followed
week
these
two
beings
led
a
happy
life
in
that
hovel
cosette
laughed
chattered
and
sang
from
daybreak
children
have
their
morning
song
as
well
as
birds
it
sometimes
happened
that
jean
valjean
clasped
her
tiny
red
hand
all
cracked
with
chilblains
and
kissed
it
the
poor
child
who
was
used
to
being
beaten
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
this
and
ran
away
in
confusion
at
times
she
became
serious
and
stared
at
her
little
black
gown
cosette
was
no
longer
in
rags
she
was
in
mourning
she
had
emerged
from
misery
and
she
was
entering
into
life
jean
valjean
had
undertaken
to
teach
her
to
read
sometimes
as
he
made
the
child
spell
he
remembered
that
it
was
with
the
idea
of
doing
evil
that
he
had
learned
to
read
in
prison
this
idea
had
ended
in
teaching
a
child
to
read
then
the
ex
convict
smiled
with
the
pensive
smile
of
the
angels
he
felt
in
it
a
premeditation
from
on
high
the
will
of
some
one
who
was
not
man
and
he
became
absorbed
in
revery
good
thoughts
have
their
abysses
as
well
as
evil
ones
to
teach
cosette
to
read
and
to
let
her
play
this
constituted
nearly
the
whole
of
jean
valjean
s
existence
and
then
he
talked
of
her
mother
and
he
made
her
pray
she
called
him
father
and
knew
no
other
name
for
him
he
passed
hours
in
watching
her
dressing
and
undressing
her
doll
and
in
listening
to
her
prattle
life
henceforth
appeared
to
him
to
be
full
of
interest
men
seemed
to
him
good
and
just
he
no
longer
reproached
any
one
in
thought
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
live
to
be
a
very
old
man
now
that
this
child
loved
him
he
saw
a
whole
future
stretching
out
before
him
illuminated
by
cosette
as
by
a
charming
light
the
best
of
us
are
not
exempt
from
egotistical
thoughts
at
times
he
reflected
with
a
sort
of
joy
that
she
would
be
ugly
this
is
only
a
personal
opinion
but
to
utter
our
whole
thought
at
the
point
where
jean
valjean
had
arrived
when
he
began
to
love
cosette
it
is
by
no
means
clear
to
us
that
he
did
not
need
this
encouragement
in
order
that
he
might
persevere
in
well
doing
he
had
just
viewed
the
malice
of
men
and
the
misery
of
society
under
a
new
aspect
incomplete
aspects
which
unfortunately
only
exhibited
one
side
of
the
truth
the
fate
of
woman
as
summed
up
in
fantine
and
public
authority
as
personified
in
javert
he
had
returned
to
prison
this
time
for
having
done
right
he
had
quaffed
fresh
bitterness
disgust
and
lassitude
were
overpowering
him
even
the
memory
of
the
bishop
probably
suffered
a
temporary
eclipse
though
sure
to
reappear
later
on
luminous
and
triumphant
but
after
all
that
sacred
memory
was
growing
dim
who
knows
whether
jean
valjean
had
not
been
on
the
eve
of
growing
discouraged
and
of
falling
once
more
he
loved
and
grew
strong
again
alas
he
walked
with
no
less
indecision
than
cosette
he
protected
her
and
she
strengthened
him
thanks
to
him
she
could
walk
through
life
thanks
to
her
he
could
continue
in
virtue
he
was
that
child
s
stay
and
she
was
his
prop
oh
unfathomable
and
divine
mystery
of
the
balances
of
destiny
chapter
iv
the
remarks
of
the
principal
tenant
jean
valjean
was
prudent
enough
never
to
go
out
by
day
every
evening
at
twilight
he
walked
for
an
hour
or
two
sometimes
alone
often
with
cosette
seeking
the
most
deserted
side
alleys
of
the
boulevard
and
entering
churches
at
nightfall
he
liked
to
go
to
saint
medard
which
is
the
nearest
church
when
he
did
not
take
cosette
with
him
she
remained
with
the
old
woman
but
the
child
s
delight
was
to
go
out
with
the
good
man
she
preferred
an
hour
with
him
to
all
her
rapturous
tete
a
tetes
with
catherine
he
held
her
hand
as
they
walked
and
said
sweet
things
to
her
it
turned
out
that
cosette
was
a
very
gay
little
person
the
old
woman
attended
to
the
housekeeping
and
cooking
and
went
to
market
they
lived
soberly
always
having
a
little
fire
but
like
people
in
very
moderate
circumstances
jean
valjean
had
made
no
alterations
in
the
furniture
as
it
was
the
first
day
he
had
merely
had
the
glass
door
leading
to
cosette
s
dressing
room
replaced
by
a
solid
door
he
still
wore
his
yellow
coat
his
black
breeches
and
his
old
hat
in
the
street
he
was
taken
for
a
poor
man
it
sometimes
happened
that
kind
hearted
women
turned
back
to
bestow
a
sou
on
him
jean
valjean
accepted
the
sou
with
a
deep
bow
it
also
happened
occasionally
that
he
encountered
some
poor
wretch
asking
alms
then
he
looked
behind
him
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
observing
him
stealthily
approached
the
unfortunate
man
put
a
piece
of
money
into
his
hand
often
a
silver
coin
and
walked
rapidly
away
this
had
its
disadvantages
he
began
to
be
known
in
the
neighborhood
under
the
name
of
the
beggar
who
gives
alms
the
old
principal
lodger
a
cross
looking
creature
who
was
thoroughly
permeated
so
far
as
her
neighbors
were
concerned
with
the
inquisitiveness
peculiar
to
envious
persons
scrutinized
jean
valjean
a
great
deal
without
his
suspecting
the
fact
she
was
a
little
deaf
which
rendered
her
talkative
there
remained
to
her
from
her
past
two
teeth
one
above
the
other
below
which
she
was
continually
knocking
against
each
other
she
had
questioned
cosette
who
had
not
been
able
to
tell
her
anything
since
she
knew
nothing
herself
except
that
she
had
come
from
montfermeil
one
morning
this
spy
saw
jean
valjean
with
an
air
which
struck
the
old
gossip
as
peculiar
entering
one
of
the
uninhabited
compartments
of
the
hovel
she
followed
him
with
the
step
of
an
old
cat
and
was
able
to
observe
him
without
being
seen
through
a
crack
in
the
door
which
was
directly
opposite
him
jean
valjean
had
his
back
turned
towards
this
door
by
way
of
greater
security
no
doubt
the
old
woman
saw
him
fumble
in
his
pocket
and
draw
thence
a
case
scissors
and
thread
then
he
began
to
rip
the
lining
of
one
of
the
skirts
of
his
coat
and
from
the
opening
he
took
a
bit
of
yellowish
paper
which
he
unfolded
the
old
woman
recognized
with
terror
the
fact
that
it
was
a
bank
bill
for
a
thousand
francs
it
was
the
second
or
third
only
that
she
had
seen
in
the
course
of
her
existence
she
fled
in
alarm
a
moment
later
jean
valjean
accosted
her
and
asked
her
to
go
and
get
this
thousand
franc
bill
changed
for
him
adding
that
it
was
his
quarterly
income
which
he
had
received
the
day
before
where
thought
the
old
woman
he
did
not
go
out
until
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
the
government
bank
certainly
is
not
open
at
that
hour
the
old
woman
went
to
get
the
bill
changed
and
mentioned
her
surmises
that
thousand
franc
note
commented
on
and
multiplied
produced
a
vast
amount
of
terrified
discussion
among
the
gossips
of
the
rue
des
vignes
saint
marcel
a
few
days
later
it
chanced
that
jean
valjean
was
sawing
some
wood
in
his
shirt
sleeves
in
the
corridor
the
old
woman
was
in
the
chamber
putting
things
in
order
she
was
alone
cosette
was
occupied
in
admiring
the
wood
as
it
was
sawed
the
old
woman
caught
sight
of
the
coat
hanging
on
a
nail
and
examined
it
the
lining
had
been
sewed
up
again
the
good
woman
felt
of
it
carefully
and
thought
she
observed
in
the
skirts
and
revers
thicknesses
of
paper
more
thousand
franc
bank
bills
no
doubt
she
also
noticed
that
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
pockets
not
only
the
needles
thread
and
scissors
which
she
had
seen
but
a
big
pocket
book
a
very
large
knife
and
a
suspicious
circumstance
several
wigs
of
various
colors
each
pocket
of
this
coat
had
the
air
of
being
in
a
manner
provided
against
unexpected
accidents
thus
the
inhabitants
of
the
house
reached
the
last
days
of
winter
chapter
v
a
five
franc
piece
falls
on
the
ground
and
produces
a
tumult
near
saint
medard
s
church
there
was
a
poor
man
who
was
in
the
habit
of
crouching
on
the
brink
of
a
public
well
which
had
been
condemned
and
on
whom
jean
valjean
was
fond
of
bestowing
charity
he
never
passed
this
man
without
giving
him
a
few
sous
sometimes
he
spoke
to
him
those
who
envied
this
mendicant
said
that
he
belonged
to
the
police
he
was
an
ex
beadle
of
seventy
five
who
was
constantly
mumbling
his
prayers
one
evening
as
jean
valjean
was
passing
by
when
he
had
not
cosette
with
him
he
saw
the
beggar
in
his
usual
place
beneath
the
lantern
which
had
just
been
lighted
the
man
seemed
engaged
in
prayer
according
to
his
custom
and
was
much
bent
over
jean
valjean
stepped
up
to
him
and
placed
his
customary
alms
in
his
hand
the
mendicant
raised
his
eyes
suddenly
stared
intently
at
jean
valjean
then
dropped
his
head
quickly
this
movement
was
like
a
flash
of
lightning
jean
valjean
was
seized
with
a
shudder
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
just
caught
sight
by
the
light
of
the
street
lantern
not
of
the
placid
and
beaming
visage
of
the
old
beadle
but
of
a
well
known
and
startling
face
he
experienced
the
same
impression
that
one
would
have
on
finding
one
s
self
all
of
a
sudden
face
to
face
in
the
dark
with
a
tiger
he
recoiled
terrified
petrified
daring
neither
to
breathe
to
speak
to
remain
nor
to
flee
staring
at
the
beggar
who
had
dropped
his
head
which
was
enveloped
in
a
rag
and
no
longer
appeared
to
know
that
he
was
there
at
this
strange
moment
an
instinct
possibly
the
mysterious
instinct
of
self
preservation
restrained
jean
valjean
from
uttering
a
word
the
beggar
had
the
same
figure
the
same
rags
the
same
appearance
as
he
had
every
day
bah
said
jean
valjean
i
am
mad
i
am
dreaming
impossible
and
he
returned
profoundly
troubled
he
hardly
dared
to
confess
even
to
himself
that
the
face
which
he
thought
he
had
seen
was
the
face
of
javert
that
night
on
thinking
the
matter
over
he
regretted
not
having
questioned
the
man
in
order
to
force
him
to
raise
his
head
a
second
time
on
the
following
day
at
nightfall
he
went
back
the
beggar
was
at
his
post
good
day
my
good
man
said
jean
valjean
resolutely
handing
him
a
sou
the
beggar
raised
his
head
and
replied
in
a
whining
voice
thanks
my
good
sir
it
was
unmistakably
the
ex
beadle
jean
valjean
felt
completely
reassured
he
began
to
laugh
how
the
deuce
could
i
have
thought
that
i
saw
javert
there
he
thought
am
i
going
to
lose
my
eyesight
now
and
he
thought
no
more
about
it
a
few
days
afterwards
it
might
have
been
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
he
was
in
his
room
and
engaged
in
making
cosette
spell
aloud
when
he
heard
the
house
door
open
and
then
shut
again
this
struck
him
as
singular
the
old
woman
who
was
the
only
inhabitant
of
the
house
except
himself
always
went
to
bed
at
nightfall
so
that
she
might
not
burn
out
her
candles
jean
valjean
made
a
sign
to
cosette
to
be
quiet
he
heard
some
one
ascending
the
stairs
it
might
possibly
be
the
old
woman
who
might
have
fallen
ill
and
have
been
out
to
the
apothecary
s
jean
valjean
listened
the
step
was
heavy
and
sounded
like
that
of
a
man
but
the
old
woman
wore
stout
shoes
and
there
is
nothing
which
so
strongly
resembles
the
step
of
a
man
as
that
of
an
old
woman
nevertheless
jean
valjean
blew
out
his
candle
he
had
sent
cosette
to
bed
saying
to
her
in
a
low
voice
get
into
bed
very
softly
and
as
he
kissed
her
brow
the
steps
paused
jean
valjean
remained
silent
motionless
with
his
back
towards
the
door
seated
on
the
chair
from
which
he
had
not
stirred
and
holding
his
breath
in
the
dark
after
the
expiration
of
a
rather
long
interval
he
turned
round
as
he
heard
nothing
more
and
as
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
door
of
his
chamber
he
saw
a
light
through
the
keyhole
this
light
formed
a
sort
of
sinister
star
in
the
blackness
of
the
door
and
the
wall
there
was
evidently
some
one
there
who
was
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
listening
several
minutes
elapsed
thus
and
the
light
retreated
but
he
heard
no
sound
of
footsteps
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
person
who
had
been
listening
at
the
door
had
removed
his
shoes
jean
valjean
threw
himself
all
dressed
as
he
was
on
his
bed
and
could
not
close
his
eyes
all
night
at
daybreak
just
as
he
was
falling
into
a
doze
through
fatigue
he
was
awakened
by
the
creaking
of
a
door
which
opened
on
some
attic
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
then
he
heard
the
same
masculine
footstep
which
had
ascended
the
stairs
on
the
preceding
evening
the
step
was
approaching
he
sprang
off
the
bed
and
applied
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
which
was
tolerably
large
hoping
to
see
the
person
who
had
made
his
way
by
night
into
the
house
and
had
listened
at
his
door
as
he
passed
it
was
a
man
in
fact
who
passed
this
time
without
pausing
in
front
of
jean
valjean
s
chamber
the
corridor
was
too
dark
to
allow
of
the
person
s
face
being
distinguished
but
when
the
man
reached
the
staircase
a
ray
of
light
from
without
made
it
stand
out
like
a
silhouette
and
jean
valjean
had
a
complete
view
of
his
back
the
man
was
of
lofty
stature
clad
in
a
long
frock
coat
with
a
cudgel
under
his
arm
the
formidable
neck
and
shoulders
belonged
to
javert
jean
valjean
might
have
attempted
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
him
through
his
window
opening
on
the
boulevard
but
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
open
the
window
he
dared
not
it
was
evident
that
this
man
had
entered
with
a
key
and
like
himself
who
had
given
him
that
key
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
when
the
old
woman
came
to
do
the
work
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
jean
valjean
cast
a
penetrating
glance
on
her
but
he
did

the
good
woman
appeared
as

as
she
swept
up
she
remarked
to
him
possibly
monsieur
may
have
heard
some
one
come
in
last
night
at
that
age
and
on
that
boulevard
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
was
the
dead
of
the
night
that
is
true
by
the
way
he
replied
in
the
most
natural
tone
possible
who
was
it
it
was
a
new
lodger
who
has
come
into
the
house
said
the
old
woman
and
what
is
his
name
i
don
t
know
exactly
dumont
or
daumont
or
some
name
of
that
sort
and
who
is
this
monsieur
dumont
the
old
woman
gazed
at
him
with
her
little
polecat
eyes
and
answered
a
gentleman
of
property
like
yourself
perhaps
she
had
no
ulterior
meaning
jean
valjean
thought
he
perceived
one
when
the
old
woman
had
taken
her
departure
he
did
up
a
hundred
francs
which
he
had
in
a
cupboard
into
a
roll
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
in
spite
of
all
the
precautions
which
he
took
in
this
operation
so
that
he
might
not
be
heard
rattling
silver
a
hundred
sou
piece
escaped
from
his
hands
and
rolled
noisily
on
the
floor
when
darkness
came
on
he
descended
and
carefully
scrutinized
both
sides
of
the
boulevard
he
saw
no
one
the
boulevard
appeared
to
be
absolutely
deserted
it
is
true
that
a
person
can
conceal
himself
behind
trees
he
went
up
stairs
again
come
he
said
to
cosette
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
they
both
went

the

of
mentioning
himself
has
been
absent
from

for
many
years
paris
has
been
transformed
since
he
quitted
it
a
new
city
has
arisen
which
is
after
a
fashion
unknown
to
him
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
say
that

the
paris
of
his

that
paris
which
he
bore
away
religiously
in
his
memory
is
now
a
paris
of
days
gone
by
he
must
be
permitted
to
speak
of
that
paris
as
though
it
still
existed
it
is
possible
that
when
the
author
conducts
his
readers
to
a
spot
and
says
in
such
a
street
there
stands
such
and
such
a
house
neither
street
nor
house
will
any
longer
exist
in
that
locality
readers
may
verify
the
facts
if
they
care
to
take
the
trouble
for
his
own
part
he
is
unacquainted
with
the
new
paris
and
he
writes
with
the
old
paris
before
his
eyes
in
an
illusion
which
is
precious
to
him
it
is
a
delight
to
him
to
dream
that
there
still
lingers
behind
him
something
of
that
which
he
beheld
when
he
was
in
his
own
country
and
that
all
has
not
vanished
so
long
as
you
go
and
come
in
your
native
land
you
imagine
that
those
streets
are
a
matter
of
indifference
to
you
that
those
windows
those
roofs
and
those
doors
are
nothing
to
you
that
those
walls
are
strangers
to
you
that
those
trees
are
merely
the
first
encountered
haphazard
that
those
houses
which
you
do
not
enter
are
useless
to
you
that
the
pavements
which
you
tread
are
merely
stones
later
on
when
you
are
no
longer
there
you
perceive
that
the
streets
are
dear
to
you
that
you
miss
those
roofs
those
doors
and
that
those
walls
are
necessary
to
you
those
trees
are
well
beloved
by
you
that
you
entered
those
houses
which
you
never
entered
every
day
and
that
you
have
left
a
part
of
your
heart
of
your
blood
of
your
soul
in
those
pavements
all
those
places
which
you
no
longer
behold
which
you
may
never
behold
again
perchance
and
whose
memory
you
have
cherished

on

melancholy
charm

with
the
melancholy
of

apparition

the
holy
land
visible
to
you
and
are
so
to
speak
the
very
form
of
france
and
you
love
them
and
you
call
them
up
as
they
are
as
they
were
and
you
persist
in
this
and
you
will
submit
to
no
change
for
you
are
attached
to
the
figure
of
your
fatherland
as
to
the
face
of
your

may
we
then
be
permitted
to

to

jean
valjean
instantly
quitted
the
boulevard
and
plunged
into
the
streets
taking
the
most
intricate
lines
which
he
could
devise
returning
on
his
track
at
times
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not

black
hunt
this
manoeuvre
is
peculiar
to
the
hunted
stag
on
soil
where
an
imprint
of
the
track
may
be
left
this
manoeuvre
possesses
among
other
advantages
that
of
deceiving
the
huntsmen
and
the
dogs
by
throwing
them
on
the
wrong
scent
in
venery
this
is
called
false
re
imbushment
the
moon
was
full
that
night
jean
valjean
was
not
sorry
for
this
the
moon
still
very
close
to
the
horizon
cast
great
masses
of
light
and
shadow
in
the
streets
jean
valjean
could
glide
along
close
to
the
houses
on
the
dark
side
and
yet
keep
watch
on
the
light
side
he
did
not
perhaps
take
sufficiently
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
dark
side
escaped
him
still
in
the
deserted
lanes
which
lie
near
the
rue
poliveau
he
thought
he
felt
certain
that
no
one
was
following
him
cosette
walked
on
without
asking
any
questions
the
sufferings
of
the
first
six
years
of
her
life
had
instilled
something
passive
into
her
nature
moreover
and
this
is
a
remark
to
which
we
shall
frequently
have
occasion
to
recur
she
had
grown
used
without
being
herself
aware
of
it
to
the
peculiarities
of
this
good
man
and
to
the
freaks
of
destiny
and
then
she
was
with
him
and
she
felt
safe
jean
valjean
knew
no
more
where
he
was
going
than
did
cosette
he
trusted
in
god
as
she
trusted
in
him
it
seemed
as
though
he
also
were
clinging
to
the
hand
of
some
one
greater
than
himself
he
thought
he
felt
a
being
leading
him
though
invisible
however
he
had
no
settled
idea
no
plan
no
project
he
was
not
even
absolutely
sure
that
it
was
javert
and
then
it
might
have
been
javert
without
javert
knowing
that
he
was
jean
valjean
was
not
he
disguised
was
not
he
believed
to
be
dead
still
queer
things
had
been
going
on
for
several
days
he
wanted
no
more
of
them
he
was
determined
not
to
return
to
the
gorbeau
house
like
the
wild
animal
chased
from
its
lair
he
was
seeking
a
hole
in
which
he
might
hide
until
he
could
find
one
where
he
might
dwell
jean
valjean
described
many
and
varied
labyrinths
in
the
mouffetard
quarter
which
was
already
asleep
as
though
the
discipline
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
yoke
of
the
curfew
still
existed
he
combined
in
various
manners
with
cunning
strategy
the
rue
censier
and
the
rue
copeau
the
rue
du
battoir
saint
victor
and
the
rue
du
puits
l
ermite
there
are
lodging
houses
in
this
locality
but
he
did
not
even
enter
one
finding
nothing
which
suited
him
he
had
no
doubt
that
if
any
one
had
chanced
to
be
upon
his
track
they
would
have
lost
it
as
eleven
o
clock
struck
from
saint
etienne
du
mont
he
was
traversing
the
rue
de
pontoise
in
front
of
the
office
of
the
commissary
of
police
situated
at
no
14
a
few
moments
later
the
instinct
of
which
we
have
spoken
above
made
him
turn
round
at
that
moment
he
saw
distinctly
thanks
to
the
commissary
s
lantern
which
betrayed
them
three
men
who
were
following
him
closely
pass
one
after
the
other
under
that
lantern
on
the
dark
side
of
the
street
one
of
the
three
entered
the
alley
leading
to
the
commissary
s
house
the
one
who
marched
at
their
head
struck
him
as
decidedly
suspicious
come
child
he
said
to
cosette
and
he
made
haste
to
quit
the
rue
pontoise
he
took
a
circuit
turned
into
the
passage
des
patriarches
which
was
closed
on
account
of
the
hour
strode
along
the
rue
de
l
epee
de
bois
and
the
rue
de
l
arbalete
and
plunged
into
the
rue
des
postes
at
that
time
there
was
a
square
formed
by
the
intersection
of
streets
where
the
college
rollin
stands
to
day
and
where
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
turns
off
it
is
understood
of
course
that
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
is
an
old
street
and
that
a
posting
chaise
does
not
pass
through
the
rue
des
postes
once
in
ten
years
in
the
thirteenth
century
this
rue
des
postes
was
inhabited
by
potters
and
its
real
name
is
rue
des
pots
the
moon
cast
a
livid
light
into
this
open
space
jean
valjean
went
into
ambush
in
a
doorway
calculating
that
if
the
men
were
still
following
him
he
could
not
fail
to
get
a
good
look
at
them
as
they
traversed
this
illuminated
space
in
point
of
fact
three
minutes
had
not
elapsed
when
the
men
made
their
appearance
there
were
four
of
them
now
all
were
tall
dressed
in
long
brown
coats
with
round
hats
and
huge
cudgels
in
their
hands
their
great
stature
and
their
vast
fists
rendered
them
no
less
alarming
than
did
their
sinister
stride
through
the
darkness
one
would
have
pronounced
them
four
spectres
disguised
as
bourgeois
they
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
space
and
formed
a
group
like
men
in
consultation
they
had
an
air
of
indecision
the
one
who
appeared
to
be
their
leader
turned
round
and
pointed
hastily
with
his
right
hand
in
the
direction
which
jean
valjean
had
taken
another
seemed
to
indicate
the
contrary
direction
with
considerable
obstinacy
at
the
moment
when
the
first
man
wheeled
round
the
moon
fell
full
in
his
face
jean
valjean
recognized

uncertainty
was
at
an
end
for
jean
valjean
fortunately
it
still
lasted
for
the
men
he
took
advantage
of
their
hesitation
it
was
time
lost
for
them
but
gained
for
him
he
slipped
from
under
the
gate
where
he
had
concealed
himself
and
went
down
the
rue
des
postes
towards
the
region
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
cosette
was
beginning
to
be
tired
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
there
were
no
passers
by
and
the
street
lanterns
had
not
been
lighted
on
account
of
there
being
a
moon
he
redoubled
his
pace
in
a
few
strides
he
had
reached
the
goblet
potteries
on
the
front
of
which
the
moonlight
rendered
distinctly
legible
the
ancient
inscription

he
left
behind
him
the
rue
de
la
clef
then
the
fountain
saint
victor
skirted
the
jardin
des
plantes
by
the
lower
streets
and
reached
the
quay
there
he
turned
round
the
quay
was
deserted
the
streets
were
deserted
there
was
no
one
behind
him
he
drew
a
long
breath
he
gained
the
pont
d
austerlitz
tolls
were
still
collected
there
at
that
epoch
he
presented
himself
at
the
toll
office
and
handed
over
a

paid
vexed
that
his

should
have

every
flight
should
be

a
heavy
cart
was
crossing
the
seine
at
the
same
time
as
himself
and
on
its
way
like
him
to
the
right
bank
this
was
of
use
to
him
he
could
traverse
the
bridge
in
the
shadow
of
the
cart
towards
the
middle
of
the
bridge
cosette
whose
feet
were
benumbed
wanted
to
walk
he
set
her
on
the
ground
and
took
her
hand
again
the
bridge
once
crossed
he
perceived
some
timber
yards
on
his
right
he
directed
his
course
thither
in
order
to
reach
them
it
was
necessary
to
risk
himself
in
a
tolerably
large
unsheltered
and
illuminated
space
he
did
not
hesitate
those
who
were
on
his
track
had
evidently
lost
the
scent
and
jean
valjean
believed
himself
to
be
out

followed
no
a
little
street
the
rue
du
chemin
vert
saint
antoine
opened
out
between
two
timber
yards
enclosed
in
walls
this
street
was
dark
and
narrow
and
seemed
made
expressly
for
him
before
entering
it
he
cast
a
glance
behind
him
from
the
point
where
he
stood
he
could
see
the
whole
extent
of
the
pont
d
austerlitz
four
shadows
were
just
entering
on
the
bridge
these
shadows
had
their
backs
turned
to
the
jardin
des
plantes
and
were
on
their
way
to
the
right
bank
these
four
shadows
were
the
four
men
jean
valjean
shuddered
like
the
wild
beast
which
is
recaptured
one
hope
remained
to
him
it
was
that
the
men
had
not
perhaps
stepped
on
the
bridge
and
had
not
caught
sight
of
him
while
he
was
crossing
the
large
illuminated
space
holding
cosette
by
the
hand
in
that
case
by
plunging
into
the
little
street
before
him
he
might
escape
if
he
could
reach
the
timber
yards
the
marshes
the
market
gardens
the
uninhabited
ground
which
was
not
built
upon
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
might
commit
himself
to
that
silent
little
street
he
entered
it
chapter

to
wit
the
plan
of

in

three
hundred
paces
further
on
he
arrived
at
a
point
where
the
street
forked
it
separated
into
two
streets
which
ran
in
a
slanting
line
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
jean
valjean
had
before
him
what
resembled
the
two
branches
of
a
y
which
should
he
choose
he
did
not
hesitate
but
took
the
one
on
the
right
why
because
that
to
the
left
ran
towards
a
suburb
that
is
to
say
towards
inhabited
regions
and
the
right
branch
towards
the
open
country
that
is
to
say
towards
deserted
regions
however
they
no
longer
walked
very
fast
cosette
s
pace
retarded
jean
valjean
s
he
took
her
up
and
carried
her
again
cosette
laid
her
head
on
the
shoulder
of
the
good
man
and
said
not
a
word
he
turned
round
from
time
to
time
and
looked
behind
him
he
took
care
to
keep
always
on
the
dark
side
of
the
street
the
street
was
straight
in
his
rear
the
first
two
or
three
times
that
he
turned
round
he
saw
nothing
the
silence
was
profound
and
he
continued
his
march
somewhat
reassured
all
at
once
on
turning
round
he
thought
he
perceived
in
the
portion
of
the
street
which
he
had
just
passed
through
far
off
in
the
obscurity
something
which
was
moving
he
rushed
forward
precipitately
rather
than
walked
hoping
to
find
some
side
street
to
make
his
escape
through
it
and
thus
to
break
his
scent
once
more
he
arrived
at
a
wall
this
wall
however
did
not
absolutely
prevent
further
progress
it
was
a
wall
which
bordered
a
transverse
street
in
which
the
one
he
had
taken
ended
here
again
he
was
obliged
to
come
to
a
decision
should
he
go
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
he
glanced
to
the
right
the
fragmentary
lane
was
prolonged
between
buildings
which
were
either
sheds
or
barns
then
ended
at
a
blind
alley
the
extremity
of
the
cul
de
sac
was
distinctly
visible
a
lofty
white
wall
he
glanced
to
the
left
on
that
side
the
lane
was
open
and
about
two
hundred
paces
further
on
ran
into
a
street
of
which
it
was
the
affluent
on
that
side
lay
safety
at
the
moment
when
jean
valjean
was
meditating
a
turn
to
the
left
in
an
effort
to
reach
the
street
which
he
saw
at
the
end
of
the
lane
he
perceived
a
sort
of
motionless
black
statue
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
and
the
street
towards
which
he
was
on
the
point
of
directing
his
steps
it
was
some
one
a
man
who
had
evidently
just
been
posted
there
and
who
was
barring
the
passage
and
waiting
jean
valjean
recoiled
the
point
of
paris
where
jean
valjean
found
himself
situated
between
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
and
la
rapee
is
one
of
those
which
recent
improvements
have
transformed
from
top
to
bottom
resulting
in
disfigurement
according
to
some
and
in
a
transfiguration
according
to
others
the
market
gardens
the
timber
yards
and
the
old
buildings
have
been
effaced
to
day
there
are
brand
new
wide
streets
arenas
circuses
hippodromes
railway
stations
and
a
prison
mazas
there
progress
as
the
reader
sees
with
its
antidote
half
a
century
ago
in
that
ordinary
popular
tongue
which
is
all
compounded
of
traditions
which
persists
in
calling
the
institut
les
quatre
nations
and
the
opera
comique
feydeau
the
precise
spot
whither
jean
valjean
had
arrived
was
called
le
petit
picpus
the
porte
saint
jacques
the
porte
paris
the
barriere
des
sergents
the
porcherons
la
galiote
les
celestins
les
capucins
le
mail
la
bourbe
l
arbre
de
cracovie
la
petite
pologne
these
are
the
names
of
old
paris
which
survive
amid
the
new
the
memory
of
the
populace
hovers
over
these
relics
of
the
past
le
petit
picpus
which
moreover
hardly
ever
had
any
existence
and
never
was
more
than
the
outline
of
a
quarter
had
nearly
the
monkish
aspect
of
a
spanish
town
the
roads
were
not
much
paved
the
streets
were
not
much
built
up
with
the
exception
of
the
two
or
three
streets
of
which
we
shall
presently
speak
all
was
wall
and
solitude
there
not
a
shop
not
a
vehicle
hardly
a
candle
lighted
here
and
there
in
the
windows
all
lights
extinguished
after
ten
o
clock
gardens
convents
timber
yards
marshes
occasional
lowly
dwellings
and
great
walls
as
high
as
the
houses
such
was
this
quarter
in
the
last
century
the
revolution
snubbed
it
soundly
the
republican
government
demolished
and
cut
through
it
rubbish
shoots
were
established
there
thirty
years
ago
this
quarter
was
disappearing
under
the
erasing
process
of
new
buildings
to
day
it
has
been
utterly
blotted
out
the
petit
picpus
of
which
no
existing
plan
has
preserved
a
trace
is
indicated
with
sufficient
clearness
in
the
plan
of
1727
published
at
paris
by
denis
thierry
rue
saint
jacques
opposite
the
rue
du
platre
and
at
lyons
by
jean
girin
rue
merciere
at
the
sign
of
prudence
petit
picpus
had
as
we
have
just
mentioned
a
y
of
streets
formed
by
the
rue
du
chemin
vert
saint
antoine
which
spread
out
in
two
branches
taking
on
the
left
the
name
of
little
picpus
street
and
on
the
right
the
name
of
the
rue
polonceau
the
two
limbs
of
the
y
were
connected
at
the
apex
as
by
a
bar
this
bar
was
called
rue
droit
mur
the
rue
polonceau
ended
there
rue
petit
picpus
passed
on
and
ascended
towards
the
lenoir
market
a
person
coming
from
the
seine
reached
the
extremity
of
the
rue
polonceau
and
had
on
his
right
the
rue
droit
mur
turning
abruptly
at
a
right
angle
in
front
of
him
the
wall
of
that
street
and
on
his
right
a
truncated
prolongation
of
the
rue
droit
mur
which
had
no
issue
and
was
called
the
cul
de
sac
genrot
it
was
here
that
jean
valjean
stood
as
we
have
just
said
on
catching
sight
of
that
black
silhouette
standing
on
guard
at
the
angle
of
the
rue
droit
mur
and
the
rue
petit
picpus
he
recoiled
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
that
phantom
was
lying
in
wait
for
him
what
was
he
to
do
the
time
for
retreating
was
passed
that
which
he
had
perceived
in
movement
an
instant
before
in
the
distant
darkness
was
javert
and
his
squad
without
a
doubt
javert
was
probably
already
at
the
commencement
of
the
street
at
whose
end
jean
valjean
stood
javert
to
all
appearances
was
acquainted
with
this
little
labyrinth
and
had
taken
his
precautions
by
sending
one
of
his
men
to
guard
the
exit
these
surmises
which
so
closely
resembled
proofs
whirled
suddenly
like
a
handful
of
dust
caught
up
by
an
unexpected
gust
of
wind
through
jean
valjean
s
mournful
brain
he
examined
the
cul
de
sac
genrot
there
he
was
cut
off
he
examined
the
rue
petit
picpus
there
stood
a
sentinel
he
saw
that
black
form
standing
out
in
relief
against
the
white
pavement
illuminated
by
the
moon
to
advance
was
to
fall
into
this
man
s
hands
to
retreat
was
to
fling
himself
into
javert
s
arms
jean
valjean
felt
himself
caught
as
in
a
net
which
was
slowly
contracting
he
gazed
heavenward
in
despair
chapter
iv
the
gropings
of
flight
in
order
to
understand
what
follows
it
is
requisite
to
form
an
exact
idea
of
the
droit
mur
lane
and
in
particular
of
the
angle
which
one
leaves
on
the
left
when
one
emerges
from
the
rue
polonceau
into
this
lane
droit
mur
lane
was
almost
entirely
bordered
on
the
right
as
far
as
the
rue
petit
picpus
by
houses
of
mean
aspect
on
the
left
by
a
solitary
building
of
severe
outlines
composed
of
numerous
parts
which
grew
gradually
higher
by
a
story
or
two
as
they
approached
the
rue
petit
picpus
side
so
that
this
building
which
was
very
lofty
on
the
rue
petit
picpus
side
was
tolerably
low
on
the
side
adjoining
the
rue
polonceau
there
at
the
angle
of
which
we
have
spoken
it
descended
to
such
a
degree
that
it
consisted
of
merely
a
wall
this
wall
did
not
abut
directly
on
the
street
it
formed
a
deeply
retreating
niche
concealed
by
its
two
corners
from
two
observers
who
might
have
been
one
in
the
rue
polonceau
the
other
in
the
rue
droit
mur
beginning
with
these
angles
of
the
niche
the
wall
extended
along
the
rue
polonceau
as
far
as
a
house
which
bore
the
number
49
and
along
the
rue
droit
mur
where
the
fragment
was
much
shorter
as
far
as
the
gloomy
building
which
we
have
mentioned
and
whose
gable
it
intersected
thus
forming
another
retreating
angle
in
the
street
this
gable
was
sombre
of
aspect
only
one
window
was
visible
or
to
speak
more
correctly
two
shutters
covered
with
a
sheet
of
zinc
and
kept
constantly
closed
the
state
of
the
places
of
which
we
are
here
giving
a
description
is
rigorously
exact
and
will
certainly
awaken
a
very
precise
memory
in
the
mind
of
old
inhabitants
of
the
quarter
the
niche
was
entirely
filled
by
a
thing
which
resembled
a
colossal
and
wretched
door
it
was
a
vast
formless
assemblage
of
perpendicular
planks
the
upper
ones
being
broader
than
the
lower
bound
together
by
long
transverse
strips
of
iron
at
one
side
there
was
a
carriage
gate
of
the
ordinary
dimensions
and
which
had
evidently
not
been
cut
more
than
fifty
years
previously
a
linden
tree
showed
its
crest
above
the
niche
and
the
wall
was
covered
with
ivy
on
the
side
of
the
rue
polonceau
in
the
imminent
peril
in
which
jean
valjean
found
himself
this
sombre
building
had
about
it
a
solitary
and
uninhabited
look
which
tempted
him
he
ran
his
eyes
rapidly
over
it
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
could
contrive
to
get
inside
it
he
might
save
himself
first
he
conceived
an
idea
then
a
hope
in
the
central
portion
of
the
front
of
this
building
on
the
rue
droit
mur
side
there
were
at
all
the
windows
of
the
different
stories
ancient
cistern
pipes
of
lead
the
various
branches
of
the
pipes
which
led
from
one
central
pipe
to
all
these
little
basins
sketched
out
a
sort
of
tree
on
the
front
these
ramifications
of
pipes
with
their
hundred
elbows
imitated
those
old
leafless
vine
stocks
which
writhe
over
the
fronts
of
old
farm
houses
this
odd
espalier
with
its
branches
of
lead
and
iron
was
the
first
thing
that
struck
jean
valjean
he
seated
cosette
with
her
back
against
a
stone
post
with
an
injunction
to
be
silent
and
ran
to
the
spot
where
the
conduit
touched
the
pavement
perhaps
there
was
some
way
of
climbing
up
by
it
and
entering
the
house
but
the
pipe
was
dilapidated
and
past
service
and
hardly
hung
to
its
fastenings
moreover
all
the
windows
of
this
silent
dwelling
were
grated
with
heavy
iron
bars
even
the
attic
windows
in
the
roof
and
then
the
moon
fell
full
upon
that
facade
and
the
man
who
was
watching
at
the
corner
of
the
street
would
have
seen
jean
valjean
in
the
act
of
climbing
and
finally
what
was
to
be
done
with
cosette
how
was
she
to
be
drawn
up
to
the
top
of
a
three
story
house
he
gave
up
all
idea
of
climbing
by
means
of
the
drain
pipe
and
crawled
along
the
wall
to
get
back
into
the
rue
polonceau
when
he
reached
the
slant
of
the
wall
where
he
had
left
cosette
he
noticed
that
no
one
could
see
him
there
as
we
have
just
explained
he
was
concealed
from
all
eyes
no
matter
from
which
direction
they
were
approaching
besides
this
he
was
in
the
shadow
finally
there
were
two
doors
perhaps
they
might
be
forced
the
wall
above
which
he
saw
the
linden
tree
and
the
ivy
evidently
abutted
on
a
garden
where
he
could
at
least
hide
himself
although
there
were
as
yet
no
leaves
on
the
trees
and
spend
the
remainder
of
the
night
time
was
passing
he
must
act
quickly
he
felt
over
the
carriage
door
and
immediately
recognized
the
fact
that
it
was
impracticable
outside
and
in
he
approached
the
other
door
with
more
hope
it
was
frightfully
decrepit
its
very
immensity
rendered
it
less
solid
the
planks
were
rotten
the
iron
bands
there
were
only
three
of
them
were
rusted
it
seemed
as
though
it
might
be
possible
to
pierce
this
worm
eaten
barrier
on
examining
it
he
found
that
the
door
was
not
a
door
it
had
neither
hinges
cross
bars
lock
nor
fissure
in
the
middle
the
iron
bands
traversed
it
from
side
to
side
without
any
break
through
the
crevices
in
the
planks
he
caught
a
view
of
unhewn
slabs
and
blocks
of
stone
roughly
cemented
together
which
passers
by
might
still
have
seen
there
ten
years
ago
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
with
consternation
that
this
apparent
door
was
simply
the
wooden
decoration
of
a
building
against
which
it
was
placed
it
was
easy
to
tear
off
a
plank
but
then
one
found
one
s
self
face
to
face
with
a
wall
chapter
v
which
would
be
impossible
with
gas
lanterns
at
that
moment
a
heavy
and
measured
sound
began
to
be
audible
at
some
distance
jean
valjean
risked
a
glance
round
the
corner
of
the
street
seven
or
eight
soldiers
drawn
up
in
a
platoon
had
just
debouched
into
the
rue
polonceau
he
saw
the
gleam
of
their
bayonets
they
were
advancing
towards
him
these
soldiers
at
whose
head
he
distinguished
javert
s
tall
figure
advanced
slowly
and
cautiously
they
halted
frequently
it
was
plain
that
they
were
searching
all
the
nooks
of
the
walls
and
all
the
embrasures
of
the
doors
and
alleys
this
was
some
patrol
that
javert
had
encountered
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
to
this
surmise
and
whose
aid
he
had
demanded
javert
s
two
acolytes
were
marching
in
their
ranks
at
the
rate
at
which
they
were
marching
and
in
consideration
of
the
halts
which
they
were
making
it
would
take
them
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
reach
the
spot
where
jean
valjean
stood
it
was
a
frightful
moment
a
few
minutes
only
separated
jean
valjean
from
that
terrible
precipice
which
yawned
before
him
for
the
third
time
and
the
galleys
now
meant
not
only
the
galleys
but
cosette
lost
to
him
forever
that
is
to
say
a
life
resembling
the
interior
of
a
tomb
there
was
but
one
thing
which
was
possible
jean
valjean
had
this
peculiarity
that
he
carried
as
one
might
say
two
beggar
s
pouches
in
one
he
kept
his
saintly
thoughts
in
the
other
the
redoubtable
talents
of
a
convict
he
rummaged
in
the
one
or
the
other
according
to
circumstances
among
his
other
resources
thanks
to
his
numerous
escapes
from
the
prison
at
toulon
he
was
as
it
will
be
remembered
a
past
master
in
the
incredible
art
of
crawling
up
without
ladder
or
climbing
irons
by
sheer
muscular
force
by
leaning
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
his
shoulders
his
hips
and
his
knees
by
helping
himself
on
the
rare
projections
of
the
stone
in
the
right
angle
of
a
wall
as
high
as
the
sixth
story
if
need
be
an
art
which
has
rendered
so
celebrated
and
so
alarming
that
corner
of
the
wall
of
the
conciergerie
of
paris
by
which
battemolle
condemned
to
death
made
his
escape
twenty
years
ago
jean
valjean
measured
with
his
eyes
the
wall
above
which
he
espied
the
linden
it
was
about
eighteen
feet
in
height
the
angle
which
it
formed
with
the
gable
of
the
large
building
was
filled
at
its
lower
extremity
by
a
mass
of
masonry
of
a
triangular
shape
probably
intended
to
preserve
that
too
convenient
corner
from
the
rubbish
of
those
dirty
creatures
called
the
passers
by
this
practice
of
filling
up
corners
of
the
wall
is
much
in
use
in
paris
this
mass
was
about
five
feet
in
height
the
space
above
the
summit
of
this
mass
which
it
was
necessary
to
climb
was
not
more
than
fourteen
feet
the
wall
was
surmounted
by
a
flat
stone
without
a
coping
cosette
was
the
difficulty
for
she
did
not
know
how
to
climb
a
wall
should
he
abandon
her
jean
valjean
did
not
once
think
of
that
it
was
impossible
to
carry
her
a
man
s
whole
strength
is
required
to
successfully
carry
out
these
singular
ascents
the
least
burden
would
disturb
his
centre
of
gravity
and
pull
him
downwards
a
rope
would
have
been
required
jean
valjean
had
none
where
was
he
to
get
a
rope
at
midnight
in
the
rue
polonceau
certainly
if
jean
valjean
had
had
a
kingdom
he
would
have
given
it
for
a
rope
at
that
moment
all
extreme
situations
have
their
lightning
flashes
which
sometimes
dazzle
sometimes
illuminate
us
jean
valjean
s
despairing
glance
fell
on
the
street
lantern
post
of
the
blind
alley
genrot
at
that
epoch
there
were
no
gas
jets
in
the
streets
of
paris
at
nightfall
lanterns
placed
at
regular
distances
were
lighted
they
were
ascended
and
descended
by
means
of
a
rope
which
traversed
the
street
from
side
to
side
and
was
adjusted
in
a
groove
of
the
post
the
pulley
over
which
this
rope
ran
was
fastened
underneath
the
lantern
in
a
little
iron
box
the
key
to
which
was
kept
by
the
lamp
lighter
and
the
rope
itself
was
protected
by
a
metal
case
jean
valjean
with
the
energy
of
a
supreme
struggle
crossed
the
street
at
one
bound
entered
the
blind
alley
broke
the
latch
of
the
little
box
with
the
point
of
his
knife
and
an
instant
later
he
was
beside
cosette
once
more
he
had
a
rope
these
gloomy
inventors
of
expedients
work
rapidly
when
they
are
fighting
against
fatality
we
have
already
explained
that
the
lanterns
had
not
been
lighted
that
night
the
lantern
in
the
cul
de
sac
genrot
was
thus
naturally
extinct
like
the
rest
and
one
could
pass
directly
under
it
without
even
noticing
that
it
was
no
longer
in
its
place
nevertheless
the
hour
the
place
the
darkness
jean
valjean
s
absorption
his
singular
gestures
his
goings
and
comings
all
had
begun
to
render
cosette
uneasy
any
other
child
than
she
would
have
given
vent
to
loud
shrieks
long
before
she
contented
herself
with
plucking
jean
valjean
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
patrol
s
approach
ever
more
and
more
distinctly
father
said
she
in
a
very
low
voice
i
am
afraid
who
is
coming
yonder
hush
replied
the
unhappy
man
it
is
madame
thenardier
cosette
shuddered
he
added
say
nothing
don
t
interfere
with
me
if
you
cry
out
if
you
weep
the
thenardier
is
lying
in
wait
for
you
she
is
coming
to
take
you
back
then
without
haste
but
without
making
a
useless
movement
with
firm
and
curt
precision
the
more
remarkable
at
a
moment
when
the
patrol
and
javert
might
come
upon
him
at
any
moment
he
undid
his
cravat
passed
it
round
cosette
s
body
under
the
armpits
taking
care
that
it
should
not
hurt
the
child
fastened
this
cravat
to
one
end
of
the
rope
by
means
of
that
knot
which
seafaring
men
call
a
swallow
knot
took
the
other
end
of
the
rope
in
his
teeth
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
which
he
threw
over
the
wall
stepped
upon
the
mass
of
masonry
and
began
to
raise
himself
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
and
the
gable
with
as
much
solidity
and
certainty
as
though
he
had
the
rounds
of
a
ladder
under
his
feet
and
elbows
half
a
minute
had
not
elapsed
when
he
was
resting
on
his
knees
on
the
wall
cosette
gazed
at
him
in
stupid
amazement
without
uttering
a
word
jean
valjean
s
injunction
and
the
name
of
madame
thenardier
had
chilled
her
blood
all
at
once
she
heard
jean
valjean
s
voice
crying
to
her
though
in
a
very
low
tone
put
your
back
against
the
wall
she
obeyed
don
t
say
a
word
and
don
t
be
alarmed
went
on
jean
valjean
and
she
felt
herself
lifted
from
the
ground
before
she
had
time
to
recover
herself
she
was
on
the
top
of
the
wall
jean
valjean
grasped
her
put
her
on
his
back
took
her
two
tiny
hands
in
his
large
left
hand
lay
down
flat
on
his
stomach
and
crawled
along
on
top
of
the
wall
as
far
as
the
cant
as
he
had
guessed
there
stood
a
building
whose
roof
started
from
the
top
of
the
wooden
barricade
and
descended
to
within
a
very
short
distance
of
the
ground
with
a
gentle
slope
which
grazed
the
linden
tree
a
lucky
circumstance
for
the
wall
was
much
higher
on
this
side
than
on
the
street
side
jean
valjean
could
only
see
the
ground
at
a
great
depth
below
him
he
had
just
reached
the
slope
of
the
roof
and
had
not
yet
left
the
crest
of
the
wall
when
a
violent
uproar
announced
the
arrival
of
the
patrol
the
thundering
voice
of
javert
was
audible
search
the
blind
alley
the
rue
droit
mur
is
guarded
so
is
the
rue
petit
picpus
i
ll
answer
for
it
that
he
is
in
the
blind
alley
the
soldiers
rushed
into
the
genrot
alley
jean
valjean
allowed
himself
to
slide
down
the
roof
still
holding
fast
to
cosette
reached
the
linden
tree
and
leaped
to
the
ground
whether
from
terror
or
courage
cosette
had
not
breathed
a
sound
though
her
hands
were
a
little
abraded
chapter
vi
the
beginning
of
an
enigma
jean
valjean
found
himself
in
a
sort
of
garden
which
was
very
vast
and
of
singular
aspect
one
of
those
melancholy
gardens
which
seem
made
to
be
looked
at
in
winter
and
at
night
this
garden
was
oblong
in
shape
with
an
alley
of
large
poplars
at
the
further
end
tolerably
tall
forest
trees
in
the
corners
and
an
unshaded
space
in
the
centre
where
could
be
seen
a
very
large
solitary
tree
then
several
fruit
trees
gnarled
and
bristling
like
bushes
beds
of
vegetables
a
melon
patch
whose
glass
frames
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
and
an
old
well
here
and
there
stood
stone
benches
which
seemed
black
with
moss
the
alleys
were
bordered
with
gloomy
and
very
erect
little
shrubs
the
grass
had
half
taken
possession
of
them
and
a
green
mould
covered
the
rest
jean
valjean
had
beside
him
the
building
whose
roof
had
served
him
as
a
means
of
descent
a
pile
of
fagots
and
behind
the
fagots
directly
against
the
wall
a
stone
statue
whose
mutilated
face
was
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
shapeless
mask
which
loomed
vaguely
through
the
gloom
the
building
was
a
sort
of
ruin
where
dismantled
chambers
were
distinguishable
one
of
which
much
encumbered
seemed
to
serve
as
a
shed
the
large
building
of
the
rue
droit
mur
which
had
a
wing
on
the
rue
petit
picpus
turned
two
facades
at
right
angles
towards
this
garden
these
interior
facades
were
even
more
tragic
than
the
exterior
all
the
windows
were
grated
not
a
gleam
of
light
was
visible
at
any
one
of
them
the
upper
story
had
scuttles
like
prisons
one
of
those
facades
cast
its
shadow
on
the
other
which
fell
over
the
garden
like
an
immense
black
pall
no
other
house
was
visible
the
bottom
of
the
garden
was
lost
in
mist
and
darkness
nevertheless
walls
could
be
confusedly
made
out
which
intersected
as
though
there
were
more
cultivated
land
beyond
and
the
low
roofs
of
the
rue
polonceau
nothing
more
wild
and
solitary
than
this
garden
could
be
imagined
there
was
no
one
in
it
which
was
quite
natural
in
view
of
the
hour
but
it
did
not
seem
as
though
this
spot
were
made
for
any
one
to
walk
in
even
in
broad
daylight
jean
valjean
s
first
care
had
been
to
get
hold
of
his
shoes
and
put
them
on
again
then
to
step
under
the
shed
with
cosette
a
man
who
is
fleeing
never
thinks
himself
sufficiently
hidden
the
child
whose
thoughts
were
still
on
the
thenardier
shared
his
instinct
for
withdrawing
from
sight
as
much
as
possible
cosette
trembled
and
pressed
close
to
him
they
heard
the
tumultuous
noise
of
the
patrol
searching
the
blind
alley
and
the
streets
the
blows
of
their
gun
stocks
against
the
stones
javert
s
appeals
to
the
police
spies
whom
he
had
posted
and
his
imprecations
mingled
with
words
which
could
not
be
distinguished
at
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
seemed
as
though
that
species
of
stormy
roar
were
becoming
more
distant
jean
valjean
held
his
breath
he
had
laid
his
hand
lightly
on
cosette
s
mouth
however
the
solitude
in
which
he
stood
was
so
strangely
calm
that
this
frightful
uproar
close
and
furious
as
it
was
did
not
disturb
him
by
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
misgiving
it
seemed
as
though
those
walls
had
been
built
of
the
deaf
stones
of
which
the
scriptures
speak
all
at
once
in
the
midst
of
this
profound
calm
a
fresh
sound
arose
a
sound
as
celestial
divine
ineffable
ravishing
as
the
other
had
been
horrible
it
was
a
hymn
which
issued
from
the
gloom
a
dazzling
burst
of
prayer
and
harmony
in
the
obscure
and
alarming
silence
of
the
night
women
s
voices
but
voices
composed
at
one
and
the
same
time
of
the
pure
accents
of
virgins
and
the
innocent
accents
of
children
voices
which
are
not
of
the
earth
and
which
resemble
those
that
the
newborn
infant
still
hears
and
which
the
dying
man
hears
already
this
song
proceeded
from
the
gloomy
edifice
which
towered
above
the
garden
at
the
moment
when
the
hubbub
of
demons
retreated
one
would
have
said
that
a
choir
of
angels
was
approaching
through
the
gloom
cosette
and
jean
valjean
fell
on
their
knees
they
knew
not
what
it
was
they
knew
not
where
they
were
but
both
of
them
the
man
and
the
child
the
penitent
and
the
innocent
felt
that
they
must
kneel
these
voices
had
this
strange
characteristic
that
they
did
not
prevent
the
building
from
seeming
to
be
deserted
it
was
a
supernatural
chant
in
an
uninhabited
house
while
these
voices
were
singing
jean
valjean
thought
of
nothing
he
no
longer
beheld
the
night
he
beheld
a
blue
sky
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
felt
those
wings
which
we
all
have
within
us
unfolding
the
song
died
away
it
may
have
lasted
a
long
time
jean
valjean
could
not
have
told
hours
of
ecstasy
are
never
more
than
a
moment
all
fell
silent
again
there
was
no
longer
anything
in
the
street
there
was
nothing
in
the
garden
that
which
had
menaced
that
which
had
reassured
him
all
had
vanished
the
breeze
swayed
a
few
dry
weeds
on
the
crest
of
the
wall
and
they
gave
out
a
faint
sweet
melancholy
sound
chapter
vii
continuation
of
the
enigma
the
night
wind
had
risen
which
indicated
that
it
must
be
between
one
and
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
poor
cosette
said
nothing
as
she
had
seated
herself
beside
him
and
leaned
her
head
against
him
jean
valjean
had
fancied
that
she
was
asleep
he
bent
down
and
looked
at
her
cosette
s
eyes
were
wide
open
and
her
thoughtful
air
pained
jean
valjean
she
was
still
trembling
are
you
sleepy
said
jean
valjean
i
am
very
cold
she
replied
a
moment
later
she
resumed
is
she
still
there
who
said
jean
valjean
madame
thenardier
jean
valjean
had
already
forgotten
the
means
which
he
had
employed
to
make
cosette
keep
silent
ah
said
he
she
is
gone
you
need
fear
nothing
further
the
child
sighed
as
though
a
load
had
been
lifted
from
her
breast
the
ground
was
damp
the
shed
open
on
all
sides
the
breeze
grew
more
keen
every
instant
the
goodman
took
off
his
coat
and
wrapped
it
round
cosette
are
you
less
cold
now
said
he
oh
yes
father
well
wait
for
me
a
moment
i
will
soon
be
back
he
quitted
the
ruin
and
crept
along
the
large
building
seeking
a
better
shelter
he
came
across
doors
but
they
were
closed
there
were
bars
at
all
the
windows
of
the
ground
floor
just
after
he
had
turned
the
inner
angle
of
the
edifice
he
observed
that
he
was
coming
to
some
arched
windows
where
he
perceived
a
light
he
stood
on
tiptoe
and
peeped
through
one
of
these
windows
they
all
opened
on
a
tolerably
vast
hall
paved
with
large
flagstones
cut
up
by
arcades
and
pillars
where
only
a
tiny
light
and
great
shadows
were
visible
the
light
came
from
a
taper
which
was
burning
in
one
corner
the
apartment
was
deserted
and
nothing
was
stirring
in
it
nevertheless
by
dint
of
gazing
intently
he
thought
he
perceived
on
the
ground
something
which
appeared
to
be
covered
with
a
winding
sheet
and
which
resembled
a
human
form
this
form
was
lying
face
downward
flat
on
the
pavement
with
the
arms
extended
in
the
form
of
a
cross
in
the
immobility
of
death
one
would
have
said
judging
from
a
sort
of
serpent
which
undulated
over
the
floor
that
this
sinister
form
had
a
rope
round
its
neck
the
whole
chamber
was
bathed
in
that
mist
of
places
which
are
sparely
illuminated
which
adds
to
horror
jean
valjean
often
said
afterwards
that
although
many
funereal
spectres
had
crossed
his
path
in
life
he
had
never
beheld
anything
more
blood
curdling
and
terrible
than
that
enigmatical
form
accomplishing
some
inexplicable
mystery
in
that
gloomy
place
and
beheld
thus
at
night
it
was
alarming
to
suppose
that
that
thing
was
perhaps
dead
and
still
more
alarming
to
think
that
it
was
perhaps
alive
he
had
the
courage
to
plaster
his
face
to
the
glass
and
to
watch
whether
the
thing
would
move
in
spite
of
his
remaining
thus
what
seemed
to
him
a
very
long
time
the
outstretched
form
made
no
movement
all
at
once
he
felt
himself
overpowered
by
an
inexpressible
terror
and
he
fled
he
began
to
run
towards
the
shed
not
daring
to
look
behind
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
turned
his
head
he
should
see
that
form
following
him
with
great
strides
and
waving
its
arms
he
reached
the
ruin
all
out
of
breath
his
knees
were
giving
way
beneath
him
the
perspiration
was
pouring
from
him
where
was
he
who
could
ever
have
imagined
anything
like
that
sort
of
sepulchre
in
the
midst
of
paris
what
was
this
strange
house
an
edifice
full
of
nocturnal
mystery
calling
to
souls
through
the
darkness
with
the
voice
of
angels
and
when
they
came
offering
them
abruptly
that
terrible
vision
promising
to
open
the
radiant
portals
of
heaven
and
then
opening
the
horrible
gates
of
the
tomb
and
it
actually
was
an
edifice
a
house
which
bore
a
number
on
the
street
it
was
not
a
dream
he
had
to
touch
the
stones
to
convince
himself
that
such
was
the
fact
cold
anxiety
uneasiness
the
emotions
of
the
night
had
given
him
a
genuine
fever
and
all
these
ideas
were
clashing
together
in
his
brain
he
stepped
up
to
cosette
she
was
asleep
chapter
viii
the
enigma
becomes
doubly
mysterious
the
child
had
laid
her
head
on
a
stone
and
fallen
asleep
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
began
to
think
little
by
little
as
he
gazed
at
her
he
grew
calm
and
regained
possession
of
his
freedom
of
mind
he
clearly
perceived
this
truth
the
foundation
of
his
life
henceforth
that
so
long
as
she
was
there
so
long
as
he
had
her
near
him
he
should
need
nothing
except
for
her
he
should
fear
nothing
except
for
her
he
was
not
even
conscious
that
he
was
very
cold
since
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
to
cover
her
nevertheless
athwart
this
revery
into
which
he
had
fallen
he
had
heard
for
some
time
a
peculiar
noise
it
was
like
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
this
sound
proceeded
from
the
garden
it
could
be
heard
distinctly
though
faintly
it
resembled
the
faint
vague
music
produced
by
the
bells
of
cattle
at
night
in
the
pastures
this
noise
made
valjean
turn
round
he
looked
and
saw
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
garden
a
being
resembling
a
man
was
walking
amid
the
bell
glasses
of
the
melon
beds
rising
stooping
halting
with
regular
movements
as
though
he
were
dragging
or
spreading
out
something
on
the
ground
this
person
appeared
to
limp
jean
valjean
shuddered
with
the
continual
tremor
of
the
unhappy
for
them
everything
is
hostile
and
suspicious
they
distrust
the
day
because
it
enables
people
to
see
them
and
the
night
because
it
aids
in
surprising
them
a
little
while
before
he
had
shivered
because
the
garden
was
deserted
and
now
he
shivered
because
there
was
some
one
there
he
fell
back
from
chimerical
terrors
to
real
terrors
he
said
to
himself
that
javert
and
the
spies
had
perhaps
not
taken
their
departure
that
they
had
no
doubt
left
people
on
the
watch
in
the
street
that
if
this
man
should
discover
him
in
the
garden
he
would
cry
out
for
help
against
thieves
and
deliver
him
up
he
took
the
sleeping
cosette
gently
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
behind
a
heap
of
old
furniture
which
was
out
of
use
in
the
most
remote
corner
of
the
shed
cosette
did
not
stir
from
that
point
he
scrutinized
the
appearance
of
the
being
in
the
melon
patch
the
strange
thing
about
it
was
that
the
sound
of
the
bell
followed
each
of
this
man
s
movements
when
the
man
approached
the
sound
approached
when
the
man
retreated
the
sound
retreated
if
he
made
any
hasty
gesture
a
tremolo
accompanied
the
gesture
when
he
halted
the
sound
ceased
it
appeared
evident
that
the
bell
was
attached
to
that
man
but
what
could
that
signify
who
was
this
man
who
had
a
bell
suspended
about
him
like
a
ram
or
an
ox
as
he
put
these
questions
to
himself
he
touched
cosette
s
hands
they
were
icy
cold
ah
good
god
he
cried
he
spoke
to
her
in
a
low
voice
cosette
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
he
shook
her
vigorously
she
did
not
wake
is
she
dead
he
said
to
himself
and
sprang
to
his
feet
quivering
from
head
to
foot
the
most
frightful
thoughts
rushed
pell
mell
through
his
mind
there
are
moments
when
hideous
surmises
assail
us
like
a
cohort
of
furies
and
violently
force
the
partitions
of
our
brains
when
those
we
love
are
in
question
our
prudence
invents
every
sort
of
madness
he
remembered
that
sleep
in
the
open
air
on
a
cold
night
may
be
fatal
cosette
was
pale
and
had
fallen
at
full
length
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
without
a
movement
he
listened
to
her
breathing
she
still
breathed
but
with
a
respiration
which
seemed
to
him
weak
and
on
the
point
of
extinction
how
was
he
to
warm
her
back
to
life
how
was
he
to
rouse
her
all
that
was
not
connected
with
this
vanished
from
his
thoughts
he
rushed
wildly
from
the
ruin
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
cosette
should
be
in
bed
and
beside
a
fire
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
chapter
ix
the
man
with
the
bell
he
walked
straight
up
to
the
man
whom
he
saw
in
the
garden
he
had
taken
in
his
hand
the
roll
of
silver
which
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
the
man
s
head
was
bent
down
and
he
did
not
see
him
approaching
in
a
few
strides
jean
valjean
stood
beside
him
jean
valjean
accosted
him
with
the
cry
one
hundred
francs
the
man
gave
a
start
and
raised
his
eyes
you
can
earn
a
hundred
francs
went
on
jean
valjean
if
you
will
grant
me
shelter
for
this
night
the
moon
shone
full
upon
jean
valjean
s
terrified
countenance
what
so
it
is
you
father
madeleine
said
the
man
that
name
thus
pronounced
at
that
obscure
hour
in
that
unknown
spot
by
that
strange
man
made
jean
valjean
start
back
he
had
expected
anything
but
that
the
person
who
thus
addressed
him
was
a
bent
and
lame
old
man
dressed
almost
like
a
peasant
who
wore
on
his
left
knee
a
leather
knee
cap
whence
hung
a
moderately
large
bell
his
face
which
was
in
the
shadow
was
not
distinguishable
however
the
goodman
had
removed
his
cap
and
exclaimed
trembling
all
over
ah
good
god
how
come
you
here
father
madeleine
where
did
you
enter
dieu
jesus
did
you
fall
from
heaven
there
is
no
trouble
about
that
if
ever
you
do
fall
it
will
be
from
there
and
what
a
state
you
are
in
you
have
no
cravat
you
have
no
hat
you
have
no
coat
do
you
know
you
would
have
frightened
any
one
who
did
not
know
you
no
coat
lord
god
are
the
saints
going
mad
nowadays
but
how
did
you
get
in
here
his
words
tumbled
over
each
other
the
goodman
talked
with
a
rustic
volubility
in
which
there
was
nothing
alarming
all
this
was
uttered
with
a
mixture
of
stupefaction
and
naive
kindliness
who
are
you
and
what
house
is
this
demanded
jean
valjean
ah
pardieu
this
is
too
much
exclaimed
the
old
man
i
am
the
person
for
whom
you
got
the
place
here
and
this
house
is
the
one
where
you
had
me
placed
what
you
don
t
recognize
me
no
said
jean
valjean
and
how
happens
it
that
you
know
me
you
saved
my
life
said
the
man
he
turned
a
ray
of
moonlight
outlined
his
profile
and
jean
valjean
recognized
old
fauchelevent
ah
said
jean
valjean
so
it
is
you
yes
i
recollect
you
that
is
very
lucky
said
the
old
man
in
a
reproachful
tone
and
what
are
you
doing
here
resumed
jean
valjean
why
i
am
covering
my
melons
of
course
in
fact
at
the
moment
when
jean
valjean
accosted
him
old
fauchelevent
held
in
his
hand
the
end
of
a
straw
mat
which
he
was
occupied
in
spreading
over
the
melon
bed
during
the
hour
or
thereabouts
that
he
had
been
in
the
garden
he
had
already
spread
out
a
number
of
them
it
was
this
operation
which
had
caused
him
to
execute
the
peculiar
movements
observed
from
the
shed
by
jean
valjean
he
continued
i
said
to
myself
the
moon
is
bright
it
is
going
to
freeze
what
if
i
were
to
put
my
melons
into
their
greatcoats
and
he
added
looking
at
jean
valjean
with
a
broad
smile
pardieu
you
ought
to
have
done
the
same
but
how
do
you
come
here
jean
valjean
finding
himself
known
to
this
man
at
least
only
under
the
name
of
madeleine
thenceforth
advanced
only
with
caution
he
multiplied
his
questions
strange
to
say
their
roles
seemed
to
be
reversed
it
was
he
the
intruder
who
interrogated
and
what
is
this
bell
which
you
wear
on
your
knee
this
replied
fauchelevent
is
so
that
i
may
be
avoided
what
so
that
you
may
be
avoided
old
fauchelevent
winked
with
an
indescribable
air
ah
goodness
there
are
only
women
in
this
house
many
young
girls
it
appears
that
i
should
be
a
dangerous
person
to
meet
the
bell
gives
them
warning
when
i
come
they
go
what
house
is
this
come
you
know
well
enough
but
i
do
not
not
when
you
got
me
the
place
here
as
gardener
answer
me
as
though
i
knew
nothing
well
then
this
is
the
petit
picpus
convent
memories
recurred
to
jean
valjean
chance
that
is
to
say
providence
had
cast
him
into
precisely
that
convent
in
the
quartier
saint
antoine
where
old
fauchelevent
crippled
by
the
fall
from
his
cart
had
been
admitted
on
his
recommendation
two
years
previously
he
repeated
as
though
talking
to
himself
the
petit
picpus
convent
exactly
returned
old
fauchelevent
but
to
come
to
the
point
how
the
deuce
did
you
manage
to
get
in
here
you
father
madeleine
no
matter
if
you
are
a
saint
you
are
a
man
as
well
and
no
man
enters
here
you
certainly
are
here
there
is
no
one
but
me
still
said
jean
valjean
i
must
stay
here
ah
good
god
cried
fauchelevent
jean
valjean
drew
near
to
the
old
man
and
said
to
him
in
a
grave
voice
father
fauchelevent
i
saved
your
life
i
was
the
first
to
recall
it
returned
fauchelevent
well
you
can
do
to
day
for
me
that
which
i
did
for
you
in
the
olden
days
fauchelevent
took
in
his
aged
trembling
and
wrinkled
hands
jean
valjean
s
two
robust
hands
and
stood
for
several
minutes
as
though
incapable
of
speaking
at
length
he
exclaimed
oh
that
would
be
a
blessing
from
the
good
god
if
i
could
make
you
some
little
return
for
that
save
your
life
monsieur
le
maire
dispose
of
the
old
man
a
wonderful
joy
had
transfigured
this
old
man
his
countenance
seemed
to
emit
a
ray
of
light
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
he
resumed
that
i
will
explain
to
you
you
have
a
chamber
i
have
an
isolated
hovel
yonder
behind
the
ruins
of
the
old
convent
in
a
corner
which
no
one
ever
looks
into
there
are
three
rooms
in
it
the
hut
was
in
fact
so
well
hidden
behind
the
ruins
and
so
cleverly
arranged
to
prevent
it
being
seen
that
jean
valjean
had
not
perceived
it
good
said
jean
valjean
now
i
am
going
to
ask
two
things
of
you
what
are
they
mr
mayor
in
the
first
place
you
are
not
to
tell
any
one
what
you
know
about
me
in
the
second
you
are
not
to
try
to
find
out
anything
more
as
you
please
i
know
that
you
can
do
nothing
that
is
not
honest
that
you
have
always
been
a
man
after
the
good
god
s
heart
and
then
moreover
you
it
was
who
placed
me
here
that
concerns
you
i
am
at
your
service
that
is
settled
then
now
come
with
me
we
will
go
and
get
the
child
ah
said
fauchelevent
so
there
is
a
child
he
added
not
a
word
further
and
followed
jean
valjean
as
a
dog
follows
his
master
less
than
half
an
hour
afterwards
cosette
who
had
grown
rosy
again
before
the
flame
of
a
good
fire
was
lying
asleep
in
the
old
gardener
s
bed
jean
valjean
had
put
on
his
cravat
and
coat
once
more
his
hat
which
he
had
flung
over
the
wall
had
been
found
and
picked
up
while
jean
valjean
was
putting
on
his
coat
fauchelevent
had
removed
the
bell
and
kneecap
which
now
hung
on
a
nail
beside
a
vintage
basket
that
adorned
the
wall
the
two
men
were
warming
themselves
with
their
elbows
resting
on
a
table
upon
which
fauchelevent
had
placed
a
bit
of
cheese
black
bread
a
bottle
of
wine
and
two
glasses
and
the
old
man
was
saying
to
jean
valjean
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
latter
s
knee
ah
father
madeleine
you
did
not
recognize
me
immediately
you
save
people
s
lives
and
then
you
forget
them
that
is
bad
but
they
remember
you
you
are
an
ingrate
chapter
x
which
explains
how
javert
got
on
the
scent
the
events
of
which
we
have
just
beheld
the
reverse
side
so
to
speak
had
come
about
in
the
simplest
possible
manner
when
jean
valjean
on
the
evening
of
the
very
day
when
javert
had
arrested
him
beside
fantine
s
death
bed
had
escaped
from
the
town
jail
of
m
sur
m
the
police
had
supposed
that
he
had
betaken
himself
to
paris
paris
is
a
maelstrom
where
everything
is
lost
and
everything
disappears
in
this
belly
of
the
world
as
in
the
belly
of
the
sea
no
forest
hides
a
man
as
does
that
crowd
fugitives
of
every
sort
know
this
they
go
to
paris
as
to
an
abyss
there
are
gulfs
which
save
the
police
know
it
also
and
it
is
in
paris
that
they
seek
what
they
have
lost
elsewhere
they
sought
the
ex
mayor
of
m
sur
m
javert
was
summoned
to
paris
to
throw
light
on
their
researches
javert
had
in
fact
rendered
powerful
assistance
in
the
recapture
of
jean
valjean
javert
s
zeal
and
intelligence
on
that
occasion
had
been
remarked
by
m
chabouillet
secretary
of
the
prefecture
under
comte
angles
m
chabouillet
who
had
moreover
already
been
javert
s
patron
had
the
inspector
of
m
sur
m
attached
to
the
police
force
of
paris
there
javert
rendered
himself
useful
in
divers
and
though
the
word
may
seem
strange
for
such
services
honorable
manners
he
no
longer
thought
of
jean
valjean
the
wolf
of
to
day
causes
these
dogs
who
are
always
on
the
chase
to
forget
the
wolf
of
yesterday
when
in
december
1823
he
read
a
newspaper
he
who
never
read
newspapers
but
javert
a
monarchical
man
had
a
desire
to
know
the
particulars
of
the
triumphal
entry
of
the
prince
generalissimo
into
bayonne
just
as
he
was
finishing
the
article
which
interested
him
a
name
the
name
of
jean
valjean
attracted
his
attention
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
the
paper
announced
that
the
convict
jean
valjean
was
dead
and
published
the
fact
in
such
formal
terms
that
javert
did
not
doubt
it
he
confined
himself
to
the
remark
that
s
a
good
entry
then
he
threw
aside
the
paper
and
thought
no
more
about
it
some
time
afterwards
it
chanced
that
a
police
report
was
transmitted
from
the
prefecture
of
the
seine
et
oise
to
the
prefecture
of
police
in
paris
concerning
the
abduction
of
a
child
which
had
taken
place
under
peculiar
circumstances
as
it
was
said
in
the
commune
of
montfermeil
a
little
girl
of
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
the
report
said
who
had
been
intrusted
by
her
mother
to
an
inn
keeper
of
that
neighborhood
had
been
stolen
by
a
stranger
this
child
answered
to
the
name
of
cosette
and
was
the
daughter
of
a
girl
named
fantine
who
had
died
in
the
hospital
it
was
not
known
where
or
when
this
report
came
under
javert
s
eye
and
set
him
to
thinking
the
name
of
fantine
was
well
known
to
him
he
remembered
that
jean
valjean
had
made
him
javert
burst
into
laughter
by
asking
him
for
a
respite
of
three
days
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
fetch
that
creature
s
child
he
recalled
the
fact
that
jean
valjean
had
been
arrested
in
paris
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
stepping
into
the
coach
for
montfermeil
some
signs
had
made
him
suspect
at
the
time
that
this
was
the
second
occasion
of
his
entering
that
coach
and
that
he
had
already
on
the
previous
day
made
an
excursion
to
the
neighborhood
of
that
village
for
he
had
not
been
seen
in
the
village
itself
what
had
he
been
intending
to
do
in
that
region
of
montfermeil
it
could
not
even
be
surmised
javert
understood
it
now
fantine
s
daughter
was
there
jean
valjean
was
going
there
in
search
of
her
and
now
this
child
had
been
stolen
by
a
stranger
who
could
that
stranger
be
could
it
be
jean
valjean
but
jean
valjean
was
dead
javert
without
saying
anything
to
anybody
took
the
coach
from
the
pewter
platter
cul
de
sac
de
la
planchette
and
made
a
trip
to
montfermeil
he
expected
to
find
a
great
deal
of
light
on
the
subject
there
he
found
a
great
deal
of
obscurity
for
the
first
few
days
the
thenardiers
had
chattered
in
their
rage
the
disappearance
of
the
lark
had
created
a
sensation
in
the
village
he
immediately
obtained
numerous
versions
of
the
story
which
ended
in
the
abduction
of
a
child
hence
the
police
report
but
their
first
vexation
having
passed
off
thenardier
with
his
wonderful
instinct
had
very
quickly
comprehended
that
it
is
never
advisable
to
stir
up
the
prosecutor
of
the
crown
and
that
his
complaints
with
regard
to
the
abduction
of
cosette
would
have
as
their
first
result
to
fix
upon
himself
and
upon
many
dark
affairs
which
he
had
on
hand
the
glittering
eye
of
justice
the
last
thing
that
owls
desire
is
to
have
a
candle
brought
to
them
and
in
the
first
place
how
explain
the
fifteen
hundred
francs
which
he
had
received
he
turned
squarely
round
put
a
gag
on
his
wife
s
mouth
and
feigned
astonishment
when
the
stolen
child
was
mentioned
to
him
he
understood
nothing
about
it
no
doubt
he
had
grumbled
for
awhile
at
having
that
dear
little
creature
taken
from
him
so
hastily
he
should
have
liked
to
keep
her
two
or
three
days
longer
out
of
tenderness
but
her
grandfather
had
come
for
her
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
he
added
the
grandfather
which
produced
a
good
effect
this
was
the
story
that
javert
hit
upon
when
he
arrived
at
montfermeil
the
grandfather
caused
jean
valjean
to
vanish
nevertheless
javert
dropped
a
few
questions
like
plummets
into
thenardier
s
history
who
was
that
grandfather
and
what
was
his
name
thenardier
replied
with
simplicity
he
is
a
wealthy
farmer
i
saw
his
passport
i
think
his
name
was
m
guillaume
lambert
lambert
is
a
respectable
and
extremely
reassuring
name
thereupon
javert
returned
to
paris
jean
valjean
is
certainly
dead
said
he
and
i
am
a
ninny
he
had
again
begun
to
forget
this
history
when
in
the
course
of
march
1824
he
heard
of
a
singular
personage
who
dwelt
in
the
parish
of
saint
medard
and
who
had
been
surnamed
the
mendicant
who
gives
alms
this
person
the
story
ran
was
a
man
of
means
whose
name
no
one
knew
exactly
and
who
lived
alone
with
a
little
girl
of
eight
years
who
knew
nothing
about
herself
save
that
she
had
come
from
montfermeil
montfermeil
that
name
was
always
coming
up
and
it
made
javert
prick
up
his
ears
an
old
beggar
police
spy
an
ex
beadle
to
whom
this
person
had
given
alms
added
a
few
more
details
this
gentleman
of
property
was
very
shy
never
coming
out
except
in
the
evening
speaking
to
no
one
except
occasionally
to
the
poor
and
never
allowing
any
one
to
approach
him
he
wore
a
horrible
old
yellow
frock
coat
which
was
worth
many
millions
being
all
wadded
with
bank
bills
this
piqued
javert
s
curiosity
in
a
decided
manner
in
order
to
get
a
close
look
at
this
fantastic
gentleman
without
alarming
him
he
borrowed
the
beadle
s
outfit
for
a
day
and
the
place
where
the
old
spy
was
in
the
habit
of
crouching
every
evening
whining
orisons
through
his
nose
and
playing
the
spy
under
cover
of
prayer
the
suspected
individual
did
indeed
approach
javert
thus
disguised
and
bestow
alms
on
him
at
that
moment
javert
raised
his
head
and
the
shock
which
jean
valjean
received
on
recognizing
javert
was
equal
to
the
one
received
by
javert
when
he
thought
he
recognized
jean
valjean
however
the
darkness
might
have
misled
him
jean
valjean
s
death
was
official
javert
cherished
very
grave
doubts
and
when
in
doubt
javert
the
man
of
scruples
never
laid
a
finger
on
any
one
s
collar
he
followed
his
man
to
the
gorbeau
house
and
got
the
old
woman
to
talking
which
was
no
difficult
matter
the
old
woman
confirmed
the
fact
regarding
the
coat
lined
with
millions
and
narrated
to
him
the
episode
of
the
thousand
franc
bill
she
had
seen
it
she
had
handled
it
javert
hired
a
room
that
evening
he
installed
himself
in
it
he
came
and
listened
at
the
mysterious
lodger
s
door
hoping
to
catch
the
sound
of
his
voice
but
jean
valjean
saw
his
candle
through
the
key
hole
and
foiled
the
spy
by
keeping
silent
on
the
following
day
jean
valjean
decamped
but
the
noise
made
by
the
fall
of
the
five
franc
piece
was
noticed
by
the
old
woman
who
hearing
the
rattling
of
coin
suspected
that
he
might
be
intending
to
leave
and
made
haste
to
warn
javert
at
night
when
jean
valjean
came
out
javert
was
waiting
for
him
behind
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
with
two
men
javert
had
demanded
assistance
at
the
prefecture
but
he
had
not
mentioned
the
name
of
the
individual
whom
he
hoped
to
seize
that
was
his
secret
and
he
had
kept
it
for
three
reasons
in
the
first
place
because
the
slightest
indiscretion
might
put
jean
valjean
on
the
alert
next
because
to
lay
hands
on
an
ex
convict
who
had
made
his
escape
and
was
reputed
dead
on
a
criminal
whom
justice
had
formerly
classed
forever
as
among
malefactors
of
the
most
dangerous
sort
was
a
magnificent
success
which
the
old
members
of
the
parisian
police
would
assuredly
not
leave
to
a
new
comer
like
javert
and
he
was
afraid
of
being
deprived
of
his
convict
and
lastly
because
javert
being
an
artist
had
a
taste
for
the
unforeseen
he
hated
those
well
heralded
successes
which
are
talked
of
long
in
advance
and
have
had
the
bloom
brushed
off
he
preferred
to
elaborate
his
masterpieces
in
the
dark
and
to
unveil
them
suddenly
at
the
last
javert
had
followed
jean
valjean
from
tree
to
tree
then
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
street
and
had
not
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
single
instant
even
at
the
moments
when
jean
valjean
believed
himself
to
be
the
most
secure
javert
s
eye
had
been
on
him
why
had
not
javert
arrested
jean
valjean
because
he
was
still
in
doubt
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
that
epoch
the
police
was
not
precisely
at
its
ease
the
free
press
embarrassed
it
several
arbitrary
arrests
denounced
by
the
newspapers
had
echoed
even
as
far
as
the
chambers
and
had
rendered
the
prefecture
timid
interference
with
individual
liberty
was
a
grave
matter
the
police
agents
were
afraid
of
making
a
mistake
the
prefect
laid
the
blame
on
them
a
mistake
meant
dismissal
the
reader
can
imagine
the
effect
which
this
brief
paragraph
reproduced
by
twenty
newspapers
would
have
caused
in
paris
yesterday
an
aged
grandfather
with
white
hair
a
respectable
and
well
to
do
gentleman
who
was
walking
with
his
grandchild
aged
eight
was
arrested
and
conducted
to
the
agency
of
the
prefecture
as
an
escaped
convict
let
us
repeat
in
addition
that
javert
had
scruples
of
his
own
injunctions
of
his
conscience
were
added
to
the
injunctions
of
the
prefect
he
was
really
in
doubt
jean
valjean
turned
his
back
on
him
and
walked
in
the
dark
sadness
uneasiness
anxiety
depression
this
fresh
misfortune
of
being
forced
to
flee
by
night
to
seek
a
chance
refuge
in
paris
for
cosette
and
himself
the
necessity
of
regulating
his
pace
to
the
pace
of
the
child
all
this
without
his
being
aware
of
it
had
altered
jean
valjean
s
walk
and
impressed
on
his
bearing
such
senility
that
the
police
themselves
incarnate
in
the
person
of
javert
might
and
did
in
fact
make
a
mistake
the
impossibility
of
approaching
too
close
his
costume
of
an
emigre
preceptor
the
declaration
of
thenardier
which
made
a
grandfather
of
him
and
finally
the
belief
in
his
death
in
prison
added
still
further
to
the
uncertainty
which
gathered
thick
in
javert
s
mind
for
an
instant
it
occurred
to
him
to
make
an
abrupt
demand
for
his
papers
but
if
the
man
was
not
jean
valjean
and
if
this
man
was
not
a
good
honest
old
fellow
living
on
his
income
he
was
probably
some
merry
blade
deeply
and
cunningly
implicated
in
the
obscure
web
of
parisian
misdeeds
some
chief
of
a
dangerous
band
who
gave
alms
to
conceal
his
other
talents
which
was
an
old
dodge
he
had
trusty
fellows
accomplices
retreats
in
case
of
emergencies
in
which
he
would
no
doubt
take
refuge
all
these
turns
which
he
was
making
through
the
streets
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
not
a
simple
and
honest
man
to
arrest
him
too
hastily
would
be
to
kill
the
hen
that
laid
the
golden
eggs
where
was
the
inconvenience
in
waiting
javert
was
very
sure
that
he
would
not
escape
thus
he
proceeded
in
a
tolerably
perplexed
state
of
mind
putting
to
himself
a
hundred
questions
about
this
enigmatical
personage
it
was
only
quite
late
in
the
rue
de
pontoise
that
thanks
to
the
brilliant
light
thrown
from
a
dram
shop
he
decidedly
recognized
jean
valjean
there
are
in
this
world
two
beings
who
give
a
profound
start
the
mother
who
recovers
her
child
and
the
tiger
who
recovers
his
prey
javert
gave
that
profound
start
as
soon
as
he
had
positively
recognized
jean
valjean
the
formidable
convict
he
perceived
that
there
were
only
three
of
them
and
he
asked
for
reinforcements
at
the
police
station
of
the
rue

pontoise
one

before

this

and
the
halt
at
the
carrefour
rollin
to
consult
with
his
agents
came
near
causing
him
to
lose
the
trail
he
speedily
divined
however
that
jean
valjean
would
want
to
put
the
river
between
his
pursuers
and
himself
he
bent
his
head
and
reflected
like
a
blood
hound
who
puts
his
nose
to
the
ground
to
make
sure
that
he
is
on
the
right
scent
javert
with
his
powerful
rectitude
of
instinct
went
straight
to
the
bridge
of
austerlitz
a
word
with
the

keeper
furnished
him
with
the
information
which
he
required

with

him

replied
the

reached
the

to
see
jean

traverse
the
small

spot
on
the

side
of
the
water
leading
cosette
by
the

he
saw
him
enter

he
remembered
the

arranged
there
like
a
trap
and
of
the
sole
exit
of
the
rue
droit
mur
into
the
rue
petit
picpus
he
made
sure
of
his
back
burrows
as
huntsmen
say
he
hastily
despatched
one
of
his
agents
by
a
roundabout
way
to
guard
that
issue
a
patrol
which
was
returning
to
the
arsenal
post
having
passed
him
he
made
a
requisition
on
it
and
caused
it
to
accompany
him
in
such
games
soldiers

aces
moreover
the
principle
is
that
in
order
to
get
the
best
of

one
must
employ
the
science
of

and
plenty
of
dogs
these
combinations
having
been
effected
feeling
that
jean
valjean
was
caught
between
the
blind
alley
genrot
on
the
right
his
agent
on
the
left
and
himself
javert
in
the
rear
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
then
he
began
the
game
he
experienced
one
ecstatic
and
infernal
moment
he
allowed
his
man
to
go
on
ahead
knowing
that
he
had
him
safe
but
desirous
of
postponing
the
moment
of
arrest
as
long
as
possible
happy
at
the
thought
that
he
was
taken
and
yet
at
seeing
him
free
gloating
over
him
with
his
gaze
with
that
voluptuousness
of
the
spider
which
allows
the
fly
to
flutter
and
of
the
cat
which
lets
the
mouse
run
claws
and

possess

monstrous
sensuality
the
obscure
movements
of
the
creature
imprisoned
in
their
pincers
what
a
delight
this
strangling
is
javert
was
enjoying
himself
the
meshes
of
his
net
were
stoutly
knotted
he
was
sure
of
success
all
he
had
to
do
now
was
to
close
his
hand
accompanied
as
he
was
the
very

of
resistance
was

when

he
was
wrong
in

him
when
he
positively

him
in

it

in
that
after
he
had
picked
up

again
on

he
played
that
formidable

puerile
game
of
keeping
such

at
the

he
thought
himself

that

to

in
the

there
were

low

jean

evidently
must
have
fled
in

the
fact
is
that
had
he

little
further
in

he
would
probably
have
done
so

there
was
an

which
it
was
necessary
to
know
if
the

once
passed
one
entered
a
little
vestibule
on
the

on

opened
a
staircase
shut
in
between

narrow
that

crossed

a

took

doubled

one
arrived
a

paces
further

square
tiled
well
scrubbed
clean
cold
and
hung
with
nankin
paper
with
green
flowers
at
fifteen
sous
the
roll
a
white
dull
light
fell
from
a
large
window
with
tiny
panes
on
the
left
which
usurped
the
whole
width
of
the
room
one
gazed
about
but
saw
no
one
one
listened
one
heard
neither
a
footstep
nor
a
human
murmur
the
walls
were
bare
the
chamber
was
not
furnished
there
was
not
even
a
chair
one
looked
again
and
beheld
on
the
wall
facing
the
door
a
quadrangular
hole
about
a
foot
square
with
a
grating
of
interlacing
iron
bars
black
knotted
solid
which
formed
squares
i
had
almost
said
meshes
of
less
than
an
inch
and
a
half
in
diagonal
length
the
little
green
flowers
of
the
nankin
paper
ran
in
a
calm
and
orderly
manner
to
those
iron
bars
without
being
startled
or
thrown
into
confusion
by
their
funereal
contact
supposing
that
a
living
being
had
been
so
wonderfully
thin
as
to
essay
an
entrance
or
an
exit
through
the
square
hole
this
grating
would
have
prevented
it
it
did
not
allow
the
passage
of
the
body
but
it
did
allow
the
passage
of
the
eyes
that
is
to
say
of
the
mind
this
seems
to
have
occurred
to
them
for
it
had
been
re
enforced
by
a
sheet
of
tin
inserted
in
the
wall
a
little
in
the
rear
and
pierced
with
a
thousand
holes
more
microscopic
than
the
holes
of
a
strainer
at
the
bottom
of
this
plate
an
aperture
had
been
pierced
exactly
similar
to
the
orifice
of
a
letter
box
a
bit
of
tape
attached
to
a
bell
wire
hung
at
the
right
of
the
grated
opening
if
the
tape
was
pulled
a
bell
rang
and
one
heard
a
voice
very
near
at
hand
which
made
one
start
who
is
there
the
voice
demanded
it
was
a
woman
s
voice
a
gentle
voice
so
gentle
that
it
was
mournful
here
again
there
was
a
magical
word
which
it
was
necessary
to
know
if
one
did
not
know
it
the
voice
ceased
the
wall
became
silent
once
more
as
though
the
terrified
obscurity
of
the
sepulchre
had
been
on
the
other
side
of
it
if
one
knew
the
password
the
voice
resumed
enter
on
the
right
one
then
perceived
on
the
right
facing
the
window
a
glass
door
surmounted
by
a
frame
glazed
and
painted
gray
on
raising
the
latch
and
crossing
the
threshold
one
experienced
precisely
the
same
impression
as
when
one
enters
at
the
theatre
into
a
grated
baignoire
before
the
grating
is
lowered
and
the
chandelier
is
lighted
one
was
in
fact
in
a
sort
of
theatre
box
narrow
furnished
with
two
old
chairs
and
a
much
frayed
straw
matting
sparely
illuminated
by
the
vague
light
from
the
glass
door
a
regular
box
with
its
front
just
of
a
height
to
lean
upon
bearing
a
tablet
of
black
wood
this
box
was
grated
only
the
grating
of
it
was
not
of
gilded
wood
as
at
the
opera
it
was
a
monstrous
lattice
of
iron
bars
hideously
interlaced
and
riveted
to
the
wall
by
enormous
fastenings
which
resembled
clenched
fists
the
first
minutes
passed
when
one
s
eyes
began
to
grow
used
to
this
cellar
like
half
twilight
one
tried
to
pass
the
grating
but
got
no
further
than
six
inches
beyond
it
there
he
encountered
a
barrier
of
black
shutters
re
enforced
and
fortified
with
transverse
beams
of
wood
painted
a
gingerbread
yellow
these
shutters
were
divided
into
long
narrow
slats
and
they
masked
the
entire
length
of
the
grating
they
were
always
closed
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
moments
one
heard
a
voice
proceeding
from
behind
these
shutters
and
saying
i
am
here
what
do
you
wish
with
me
it
was
a
beloved
sometimes
an
adored
voice
no
one
was
visible
hardly
the
sound
of
a
breath
was
audible
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
a
spirit
which
had
been
evoked
that
was
speaking
to
you
across
the
walls
of
the
tomb
if
one
chanced
to
be
within
certain
prescribed
and
very
rare
conditions
the
slat
of
one
of
the
shutters
opened
opposite
you
the
evoked
spirit
became
an
apparition
behind
the
grating
behind
the
shutter
one
perceived
so
far
as
the
grating
permitted
sight
a
head
of
which
only
the
mouth
and
the
chin
were
visible
the
rest
was
covered
with
a
black
veil
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
guimpe
and
a
form
that
was
barely
defined
covered
with
a
black
shroud
that
head
spoke
with
you
but
did
not
look
at
you
and
never
smiled
at
you
the
light
which
came
from
behind
you
was
adjusted
in
such
a
manner
that
you
saw
her
in
the
white
and
she
saw
you
in
the
black
this
light
was
symbolical
nevertheless
your
eyes
plunged
eagerly
through
that
opening
which
was
made
in
that
place
shut
off
from
all
glances
a
profound
vagueness
enveloped
that
form
clad
in
mourning
your
eyes
searched
that
vagueness
and
sought
to
make
out
the
surroundings
of
the
apparition
at
the
expiration
of
a
very
short
time
you
discovered
that
you
could
see
nothing
what
you
beheld
was
night
emptiness
shadows
a
wintry
mist
mingled
with
a
vapor
from
the
tomb
a
sort
of
terrible
peace
a
silence
from
which
you
could
gather
nothing
not
even
sighs
a
gloom
in
which
you
could
distinguish
nothing
not
even
phantoms
what
you
beheld
was
the
interior
of
a
cloister
it
was
the
interior
of
that
severe
and
gloomy
edifice
which
was
called
the
convent
of
the
bernardines
of
the
perpetual
adoration
the
box
in
which
you
stood
was
the
parlor
the
first
voice
which
had
addressed
you
was
that
of
the
portress
who
always
sat
motionless
and
silent
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
near
the
square
opening
screened
by
the
iron
grating
and
the
plate
with
its
thousand
holes
as
by
a
double
visor
the
obscurity
which
bathed
the
grated
box
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
parlor
which
had
a
window
on
the
side
of
the
world
had
none
on
the
side
of
the
convent
profane
eyes
must
see
nothing
of
that
sacred
place
nevertheless
there
was
something
beyond
that
shadow
there
was
a
light
there
was
life
in
the
midst
of
that
death
although
this
was
the
most
strictly
walled
of
all
convents
we
shall
endeavor
to
make
our
way
into
it
and
to
take
the
reader
in
and
to
say
without
transgressing
the
proper
bounds
things
which
story
tellers
have
never
seen
and
have
therefore
never
described
chapter
ii
the
obedience
of
martin
verga
this
convent
which
in
1824
had
already
existed
for
many
a
long
year
in
the
rue
petit
picpus
was
a
community
of
bernardines
of
the
obedience
of
martin
verga
these
bernardines
were
attached
in
consequence
not
to
clairvaux
like
the
bernardine
monks
but
to
citeaux
like
the
benedictine
monks
in
other
words
they
were
the
subjects
not
of
saint
bernard
but
of
saint
benoit
any
one
who
has
turned
over
old
folios
to
any
extent
knows
that
martin
verga
founded
in
1425
a
congregation
of
bernardines
benedictines
with
salamanca
for
the
head
of
the
order
and
alcala
as
the
branch
establishment
this
congregation
had
sent
out
branches
throughout
all
the
catholic
countries
of
europe
there
is
nothing
unusual
in
the
latin
church
in
these
grafts
of
one
order
on
another
to
mention
only
a
single
order
of
saint
benoit
which
is
here
in
question
there
are
attached
to
this
order
without
counting
the
obedience
of
martin
verga
four
congregations
two
in
italy
mont
cassin
and
sainte
justine
of
padua
two
in
france
cluny
and
saint
maur
and
nine
orders
vallombrosa
granmont
the
celestins
the
camaldules
the
carthusians
the
humilies
the
olivateurs
the
silvestrins
and
lastly
citeaux
for
citeaux
itself
a
trunk
for
other
orders
is
only
an
offshoot
of
saint
benoit
citeaux
dates
from
saint
robert
abbe
de
molesme
in
the
diocese
of
langres
in
1098
now
it
was
in
529
that
the
devil
having
retired
to
the
desert
of
subiaco
he
was
old
had
he
turned
hermit
was
chased
from
the
ancient
temple
of
apollo
where
he
dwelt
by
saint
benoit
then
aged
seventeen
after
the
rule
of
the
carmelites
who
go
barefoot
wear
a
bit
of
willow
on
their
throats
and
never
sit
down
the
harshest
rule
is
that
of
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
martin
verga
they
are
clothed
in
black
with
a
guimpe
which
in
accordance
with
the
express
command
of
saint
benoit
mounts
to
the
chin
a
robe
of
serge
with
large
sleeves
a
large
woollen
veil
the
guimpe
which
mounts
to
the
chin
cut
square
on
the
breast
the
band
which
descends
over
their
brow
to
their
eyes
this
is
their
dress
all
is
black
except
the
band
which
is
white
the
novices
wear
the
same
habit
but
all
in
white
the
professed
nuns
also
wear
a
rosary
at
their
side
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
martin
verga
practise
the
perpetual
adoration
like
the
benedictines
called
ladies
of
the
holy
sacrament
who
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
had
two
houses
in
paris
one
at
the
temple
the
other
in
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
however
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
the
petit
picpus
of
whom
we
are
speaking
were
a
totally
different
order
from
the
ladies
of
the
holy
sacrament
cloistered
in
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
and
at
the
temple
there
were
numerous
differences
in
their
rule
there
were
some
in
their
costume
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
the
petit
picpus
wore
the
black
guimpe
and
the
benedictines
of
the
holy
sacrament
and
of
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
wore
a
white
one
and
had
besides
on
their
breasts
a
holy
sacrament
about
three
inches
long
in
silver
gilt
or
gilded
copper
the
nuns
of
the
petit
picpus
did
not
wear
this
holy
sacrament
the
perpetual
adoration
which
was
common
to
the
house
of
the
petit
picpus
and
to
the
house
of
the
temple
leaves
those
two
orders
perfectly
distinct
their
only
resemblance
lies
in
this
practice
of
the
ladies
of
the
holy
sacrament
and
the
bernardines
of
martin
verga
just
as
there
existed
a
similarity
in
the
study
and
the
glorification
of
all
the
mysteries
relating
to
the
infancy
the
life
and
death
of
jesus
christ
and
the
virgin
between
the
two
orders
which
were
nevertheless
widely
separated
and
on
occasion
even
hostile
the
oratory
of
italy
established
at
florence
by
philip
de
neri
and
the
oratory
of
france
established
by
pierre
de
berulle
the
oratory
of
france
claimed
the
precedence
since
philip
de
neri
was
only
a
saint
while
berulle
was
a
cardinal
let
us
return
to
the
harsh
spanish
rule
of
martin
verga
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
this
obedience
fast
all
the
year
round
abstain
from
meat
fast
in
lent
and
on
many
other
days
which
are
peculiar
to
them
rise
from
their
first
sleep
from
one
to
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
read
their
breviary
and
chant
matins
sleep
in
all
seasons
between
serge
sheets
and
on
straw
make
no
use
of
the
bath
never
light
a
fire
scourge
themselves
every
friday
observe
the
rule
of
silence
speak
to
each
other
only
during
the
recreation
hours
which
are
very
brief
and
wear
drugget
chemises
for
six
months
in
the
year
from
september
14th
which
is
the
exaltation
of
the
holy
cross
until
easter
these
six
months
are
a
modification
the
rule
says
all
the
year
but
this
drugget
chemise
intolerable
in
the
heat
of
summer
produced
fevers
and
nervous
spasms
the
use
of
it
had
to
be
restricted
even
with
this
palliation
when
the
nuns
put
on
this
chemise
on
the
14th
of
september
they
suffer
from
fever
for
three
or
four
days
obedience
poverty
chastity
perseverance
in
their
seclusion
these
are
their
vows
which
the
rule
greatly
aggravates
the
prioress
is
elected
for
three
years
by
the
mothers
who
are
called
meres
vocales
because
they
have
a
voice
in
the
chapter
a
prioress
can
only
be
re
elected
twice
which
fixes
the
longest
possible
reign
of
a
prioress
at
nine
years
they
never
see
the
officiating
priest
who
is
always
hidden
from
them
by
a
serge
curtain
nine
feet
in
height
during
the
sermon
when
the
preacher
is
in
the
chapel
they
drop
their
veils
over
their
faces
they
must
always
speak
low
walk
with
their
eyes
on
the
ground
and
their
heads
bowed
one
man
only
is
allowed
to
enter
the
convent
the
archbishop
of
the
diocese
there
is
really
one
other
the
gardener
but
he
is
always
an
old
man
