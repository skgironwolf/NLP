a
preface
to
the
first
edition
of
jane
eyre
being
unnecessary
i
gave
none
this
second
edition
demands
a
few
words
both
of
acknowledgment
and
miscellaneous
remark
my
thanks
are
due
in
three
quarters
to
the
public
for
the
indulgent
ear
it
has
inclined
to
a
plain
tale
with
few
pretensions
to
the
press
for
the
fair
field
its
honest
suffrage
has
opened
to
an
obscure
aspirant
to
my
publishers
for
the
aid
their
tact
their
energy
their
practical
sense
and
frank
liberality
have
afforded
an
unknown
and
unrecommended
author
the
press
and
the
public
are
but
vague
personifications
for
me
and
i
must
thank
them
in
vague
terms
but
my
publishers
are
definite
so
are
certain
generous
critics
who
have
encouraged
me
as
only
large
hearted
and
high
minded
men
know
how
to
encourage
a
struggling
stranger
to
them
i
e
to
my
publishers
and
the
select
reviewers
i
say
cordially
gentlemen
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
having
thus
acknowledged
what
i
owe
those
who
have
aided
and
approved
me
i
turn
to
another
class
a
small
one
so
far
as
i
know
but
not
therefore
to
be
overlooked
i
mean
the
timorous
or
carping
few
who
doubt
the
tendency
of
such
books
as
jane
eyre
in
whose
eyes
whatever
is
unusual
is
wrong
whose
ears
detect
in
each
protest
against
bigotry
that
parent
of
crime
an
insult
to
piety
that
regent
of
god
on
earth
i
would
suggest
to
such
doubters
certain
obvious
distinctions
i
would
remind
them
of
certain
simple
truths
conventionality
is
not
morality
self
righteousness
is
not
religion
to
attack
the
first
is
not
to
assail
the
last
to
pluck
the
mask
from
the
face
of
the
pharisee
is
not
to
lift
an
impious
hand
to
the
crown
of
thorns
these
things
and
deeds
are
diametrically
opposed
they
are
as
distinct
as
is
vice
from
virtue
men
too
often
confound
them
they
should
not
be
confounded
appearance
should
not
be
mistaken
for
truth
narrow
human
doctrines
that
only
tend
to
elate
and
magnify
a
few
should
not
be
substituted
for
the
world
redeeming
creed
of
christ
there
is
i
repeat
it
a
difference
and
it
is
a
good
and
not
a
bad
action
to
mark
broadly
and
clearly
the
line
of
separation
between
them
the
world
may
not
like
to
see
these
ideas
dissevered
for
it
has
been
accustomed
to
blend
them
finding
it
convenient
to
make
external
show
pass
for
sterling
worth
to
let
white
washed
walls
vouch
for
clean
shrines
it
may
hate
him
who
dares
to
scrutinise
and
expose
to
rase
the
gilding
and
show
base
metal
under
it
to
penetrate
the
sepulchre
and
reveal
charnel
relics
but
hate
as
it
will
it
is
indebted
to
him
ahab
did
not
like
micaiah
because
he
never
prophesied
good
concerning
him
but
evil
probably
he
liked
the
sycophant
son
of
chenaannah
better
yet
might
ahab
have
escaped
a
bloody
death
had
he
but
stopped
his
ears
to
flattery
and
opened
them
to
faithful
counsel
there
is
a
man
in
our
own
days
whose
words
are
not
framed
to
tickle
delicate
ears
who
to
my
thinking
comes
before
the
great
ones
of
society
much
as
the
son
of
imlah
came
before
the
throned
kings
of
judah
and
israel
and
who
speaks
truth
as
deep
with
a
power
as
prophet
like
and
as
vital
a
mien
as
dauntless
and
as
daring
is
the
satirist
of
vanity
fair
admired
in
high
places
i
cannot
tell
but
i
think
if
some
of
those
amongst
whom
he
hurls
the
greek
fire
of
his
sarcasm
and
over
whom
he
flashes
the
levin
brand
of
his
denunciation
were
to
take
his
warnings
in
time
they
or
their
seed
might
yet
escape
a
fatal
rimoth
gilead
why
have
i
alluded
to
this
man
i
have
alluded
to
him
reader
because
i
think
i
see
in
him
an
intellect
profounder
and
more
unique
than
his
contemporaries
have
yet
recognised
because
i
regard
him
as
the
first
social
regenerator
of
the
day
as
the
very
master
of
that
working
corps
who
would
restore
to
rectitude
the
warped
system
of
things
because
i
think
no
commentator
on
his
writings
has
yet
found
the
comparison
that
suits
him
the
terms
which
rightly
characterise
his
talent
they
say
he
is
like
fielding
they
talk
of
his
wit
humour
comic
powers
he
resembles
fielding
as
an
eagle
does
a
vulture
fielding
could
stoop
on
carrion
but
thackeray
never
does
his
wit
is
bright
his
humour
attractive
but
both
bear
the
same
relation
to
his
serious
genius
that
the
mere
lambent
sheet
lightning
playing
under
the
edge
of
the
summer
cloud
does
to
the
electric
death
spark
hid
in
its
womb
finally
i
have
alluded
to
mr
thackeray
because
to
him
if
he
will
accept
the
tribute
of
a
total
stranger
i
have
dedicated
this
second
edition
of
jane
eyre
currer

note
to
the
third
edition
i
avail
myself
of
the
opportunity
which
a
third
edition
of
jane
eyre
affords
me
of
again
addressing
a
word
to
the
public
to
explain
that
my
claim
to
the
title
of
novelist
rests
on
this
one
work
alone
if
therefore
the
authorship
of
other
works
of
fiction
has
been
attributed
to
me
an
honour
is
awarded
where
it
is
not
merited
and
consequently
denied
where
it
is
justly
due
this
explanation
will
serve
to
rectify
mistakes
which
may
already
have
been
made
and
to
prevent
future
errors

there
was
no
possibility
of
taking
a
walk
that
day
we
had
been
wandering
indeed
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
but
since
dinner
mrs
reed
when
there
was
no
company
dined
early
the
cold
winter
wind
had
brought
with
it
clouds
so
sombre
and
a
rain
so
penetrating
that
further
out
door
exercise
was
now
out
of
the
question
i
was
glad
of
it
i
never
liked
long
walks
especially
on
chilly
afternoons
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
with
nipped
fingers
and
toes
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidings
of
bessie
the
nurse
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
my
physical
inferiority
to
eliza
john
and
georgiana
reed
the
said
eliza
john
and
georgiana
were
now
clustered
round
their
mama
in
the
drawing
room
she
lay
reclined
on
a
sofa
by
the
fireside
and
with
her
darlings
about
her
for
the
time
neither
quarrelling
nor
crying
looked
perfectly
happy
me
she
had
dispensed
from
joining
the
group
saying
she
regretted
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
keeping
me
at
a
distance
but
that
until
she
heard
from
bessie
and
could
discover
by
her
own
observation
that
i
was
endeavouring
in
good
earnest
to
acquire
a
more
sociable
and
childlike
disposition
a
more
attractive
and
sprightly
manner
something
lighter
franker
more
natural
as
it
were
she
really
must
exclude
me
from
privileges
intended
only
for
contented
happy
little
children
what
does
bessie
say
i
have
done
i
asked
jane
i
don
t
like
cavillers
or
questioners
besides
there
is
something
truly
forbidding
in
a
child
taking
up
her
elders
in
that
manner
be
seated
somewhere
and
until
you
can
speak
pleasantly
remain
silent
a
breakfast
room
adjoined
the
drawing
room
i
slipped
in
there
it
contained
a
bookcase
i
soon
possessed
myself
of
a
volume
taking
care
that
it
should
be
one
stored
with
pictures
i
mounted
into
the
window
seat
gathering
up
my
feet
i
sat
cross
legged
like
a
turk
and
having
drawn
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
i
was
shrined
in
double
retirement
folds
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my
view
to
the
right
hand
to
the
left
were
the
clear
panes
of
glass
protecting
but
not
separating
me
from
the
drear
november
day
at
intervals
while
turning
over
the
leaves
of
my
book
i
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winter
afternoon
afar
it
offered
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
near
a
scene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
beat
shrub
with
ceaseless
rain
sweeping
away
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
i
returned
to
my
book
bewick
s
history
of
british
birds
the
letterpress
thereof
i
cared
little
for
generally
speaking
and
yet
there
were
certain
introductory
pages
that
child
as
i
was
i
could
not
pass
quite
as
a
blank
they
were
those
which
treat
of
the
haunts
of
sea
fowl
of
the
solitary
rocks
and
promontories
by
them
only
inhabited
of
the
coast
of
norway
studded
with
isles
from
its
southern
extremity
the
lindeness
or
naze
to
the
north
cape
where
the
northern
ocean
in
vast
whirls
boils
round
the
naked
melancholy
isles
of
farthest
thule
and
the
atlantic
surge
pours
in
among
the
stormy
hebrides
nor
could
i
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
of
lapland
siberia
spitzbergen
nova
zembla
iceland
greenland
with
the
vast
sweep
of
the
arctic
zone
and
those
forlorn
regions
of
dreary
space
that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
where
firm
fields
of
ice
the
accumulation
of
centuries
of
winters
glazed
in
alpine
heights
above
heights
surround
the
pole
and
concentre
the
multiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
of
these
death
white
realms
i
formed
an
idea
of
my
own
shadowy
like
all
the
half
comprehended
notions
that
float
dim
through
children
s
brains
but
strangely
impressive
the
words
in
these
introductory
pages
connected
themselves
with
the
succeeding
vignettes
and
gave
significance
to
the
rock
standing
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
to
the
broken
boat
stranded
on
a
desolate
coast
to
the
cold
and
ghastly
moon
glancing
through
bars
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sinking
i
cannot
tell
what
sentiment
haunted
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
with
its
inscribed
headstone
its
gate
its
two
trees
its
low
horizon
girdled
by
a
broken
wall
and
its
newly
risen
crescent
attesting
the
hour
of
eventide
the
two
ships
becalmed
on
a
torpid
sea
i
believed
to
be
marine
phantoms
the
fiend
pinning
down
the
thief
s
pack
behind
him
i
passed
over
quickly
it
was
an
object
of
terror
so
was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on
a
rock
surveying
a
distant
crowd
surrounding
a
gallows
each
picture
told
a
story
mysterious
often
to
my
undeveloped
understanding
and
imperfect
feelings
yet
ever
profoundly
interesting
as
interesting
as
the
tales
bessie
sometimes
narrated
on
winter
evenings
when
she
chanced
to
be
in
good
humour
and
when
having
brought
her
ironing
table
to
the
nursery
hearth
she
allowed
us
to
sit
about
it
and
while
she
got
up
mrs
reed
s
lace
frills
and
crimped
her
nightcap
borders
fed
our
eager
attention
with
passages
of
love
and
adventure
taken
from
old
fairy
tales
and
other
ballads
or
as
at
a
later
period
i
discovered
from
the
pages
of
pamela
and
henry
earl
of
moreland
with
bewick
on
my
knee
i
was
then
happy
happy
at
least
in
my
way
i
feared
nothing
but
interruption
and
that
came
too
soon
the
breakfast
room
door
opened
boh
madam
mope
cried
the
voice
of
john
reed
then
he
paused
he
found
the
room
apparently
empty
where
the
dickens
is
she
he
continued
lizzy
georgy
calling
to
his
sisters
joan
is
not
here
tell
mama
she
is
run
out
into
the
rain
bad
animal
it
is
well
i
drew
the
curtain
thought
i
and
i
wished
fervently
he
might
not
discover
my
hiding
place
nor
would
john
reed
have
found
it
out
himself
he
was
not
quick
either
of
vision
or
conception
but
eliza
just
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
at
once
she
is
in
the
window
seat
to
be
sure
jack
and
i
came
out
immediately
for
i
trembled
at
the
idea
of
being
dragged
forth
by
the
said
jack
what
do
you
want
i
asked
with
awkward
diffidence
say
what
do
you
want
master
reed
was
the
answer
i
want
you
to
come
here
and
seating
himself
in
an
arm
chair
he
intimated
by
a
gesture
that
i
was
to
approach
and
stand
before
him
john
reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
four
years
older
than
i
for
i
was
but
ten
large
and
stout
for
his
age
with
a
dingy
and
unwholesome
skin
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
heavy
limbs
and
large
extremities
he
gorged
himself
habitually
at
table
which
made
him
bilious
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eye
and
flabby
cheeks
he
ought
now
to
have
been
at
school
but
his
mama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
on
account
of
his
delicate
health
mr
miles
the
master
affirmed
that
he
would
do
very
well
if
he
had
fewer
cakes
and
sweetmeats
sent
him
from
home
but
the
mother
s
heart
turned
from
an
opinion
so
harsh
and
inclined
rather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
john
s
sallowness
was
owing
to
over
application
and
perhaps
to
pining
after
home
john
had
not
much
affection
for
his
mother
and
sisters
and
an
antipathy
to
me
he
bullied
and
punished
me
not
two
or
three
times
in
the
week
nor
once
or
twice
in
the
day
but
continually
every
nerve
i
had
feared
him
and
every
morsel
of
flesh
in
my
bones
shrank
when
he
came
near
there
were
moments
when
i
was
bewildered
by
the
terror
he
inspired
because
i
had
no
appeal
whatever
against
either
his
menaces
or
his
inflictions
the
servants
did
not
like
to
offend
their
young
master
by
taking
my
part
against
him
and
mrs
reed
was
blind
and
deaf
on
the
subject
she
never
saw
him
strike
or
heard
him
abuse
me
though
he
did
both
now
and
then
in
her
very
presence
more
frequently
however
behind
her
back
habitually
obedient
to
john
i
came
up
to
his
chair
he
spent
some
three
minutes
in
thrusting
out
his
tongue
at
me
as
far
as
he
could
without
damaging
the
roots
i
knew
he
would
soon
strike
and
while
dreading
the
blow
i
mused
on
the
disgusting
and
ugly
appearance
of
him
who
would
presently
deal
it
i
wonder
if
he
read
that
notion
in
my
face
for
all
at
once
without
speaking
he
struck
suddenly
and
strongly
i
tottered
and
on
regaining
my
equilibrium
retired
back
a
step
or
two
from
his
chair
that
is
for
your
impudence
in
answering
mama
awhile
since
said
he
and
for
your
sneaking
way
of
getting
behind
curtains
and
for
the
look
you
had
in
your
eyes
two
minutes
since
you
rat
accustomed
to
john
reed
s
abuse
i
never
had
an
idea
of
replying
to
it
my
care
was
how
to
endure
the
blow
which
would
certainly
follow
the
insult
what
were
you
doing
behind
the
curtain
he
asked
i
was
reading
show
the
book
i
returned
to
the
window
and
fetched
it
thence
you
have
no
business
to
take
our
books
you
are
a
dependent
mama
says
you
have
no
money
your
father
left
you
none
you
ought
to
beg
and
not
to
live
here
with
gentlemen
s
children
like
us
and
eat
the
same
meals
we
do
and
wear
clothes
at
our
mama
s
expense
now
i
ll
teach
you
to
rummage
my
bookshelves
for
they
are
mine
all
the
house
belongs
to
me
or
will
do
in
a
few
years
go
and
stand
by
the
door
out
of
the
way
of
the
mirror
and
the
windows
i
did
so
not
at
first
aware
what
was
his
intention
but
when
i
saw
him
lift
and
poise
the
book
and
stand
in
act
to
hurl
it
i
instinctively
started
aside
with
a
cry
of
alarm
not
soon
enough
however
the
volume
was
flung
it
hit
me
and
i
fell
striking
my
head
against
the
door
and
cutting
it
the
cut
bled
the
pain
was
sharp
my
terror
had
passed
its
climax
other
feelings
succeeded
wicked
and
cruel
boy
i
said
you
are
like
a
murderer
you
are
like
a
slave
driver
you
are
like
the
roman
emperors
i
had
read
goldsmith
s
history
of
rome
and
had
formed
my
opinion
of
nero
caligula
c
also
i
had
drawn
parallels
in
silence
which
i
never
thought
thus
to
have
declared
aloud
what
what
he
cried
did
she
say
that
to
me
did
you
hear
her
eliza
and
georgiana
won
t
i
tell
mama
but
first
he
ran
headlong
at
me
i
felt
him
grasp
my
hair
and
my
shoulder
he
had
closed
with
a
desperate
thing
i
really
saw
in
him
a
tyrant
a
murderer
i
felt
a
drop
or
two
of
blood
from
my
head
trickle
down
my
neck
and
was
sensible
of
somewhat
pungent
suffering
these
sensations
for
the
time
predominated
over
fear
and
i
received
him
in
frantic
sort
i
don
t
very
well
know
what
i
did
with
my
hands
but
he
called
me
rat
rat
and
bellowed
out
aloud
aid
was
near
him
eliza
and
georgiana
had
run
for
mrs
reed
who
was
gone
upstairs
she
now
came
upon
the
scene
followed
by
bessie
and
her
maid
abbot
we
were
parted
i
heard
the
words
dear
dear
what
a
fury
to
fly
at
master
john
did
ever
anybody
see
such
a
picture
of
passion
then
mrs
reed
subjoined
take
her
away
to
the
red
room
and
lock
her
in
there
four
hands
were
immediately
laid
upon
me
and
i
was
borne
upstairs
chapter
ii
i
resisted
all
the
way
a
new
thing
for
me
and
a
circumstance
which
greatly
strengthened
the
bad
opinion
bessie
and
miss
abbot
were
disposed
to
entertain
of
me
the
fact
is
i
was
a
trifle
beside
myself
or
rather
out
of
myself
as
the
french
would
say
i
was
conscious
that
a
moment
s
mutiny
had
already
rendered
me
liable
to
strange
penalties
and
like
any
other
rebel
slave
i
felt
resolved
in
my
desperation
to
go
all
lengths
hold
her
arms
miss
abbot
she
s
like
a
mad
cat
for
shame
for
shame
cried
the
lady
s
maid
what
shocking
conduct
miss
eyre
to
strike
a
young
gentleman
your
benefactress
s
son
your
young
master
master
how
is
he
my
master
am
i
a
servant
no
you
are
less
than
a
servant
for
you
do
nothing
for
your
keep
there
sit
down
and
think
over
your
wickedness
they
had
got
me
by
this
time
into
the
apartment
indicated
by
mrs
reed
and
had
thrust
me
upon
a
stool
my
impulse
was
to
rise
from
it
like
a
spring
their
two
pair
of
hands
arrested
me
instantly
if
you
don
t
sit
still
you
must
be
tied
down
said
bessie
miss
abbot
lend
me
your
garters
she
would
break
mine
directly
miss
abbot
turned
to
divest
a
stout
leg
of
the
necessary
ligature
this
preparation
for
bonds
and
the
additional
ignominy
it
inferred
took
a
little
of
the
excitement
out
of
me
don
t
take
them
off
i
cried
i
will
not
stir
in
guarantee
whereof
i
attached
myself
to
my
seat
by
my
hands
mind
you
don
t
said
bessie
and
when
she
had
ascertained
that
i
was
really
subsiding
she
loosened
her
hold
of
me
then
she
and
miss
abbot
stood
with
folded
arms
looking
darkly
and
doubtfully
on
my
face
as
incredulous
of
my
sanity
she
never
did
so
before
at
last
said
bessie
turning
to
the
abigail
but
it
was
always
in
her
was
the
reply
i
ve
told
missis
often
my
opinion
about
the
child
and
missis
agreed
with
me
she
s
an
underhand
little
thing
i
never
saw
a
girl
of
her
age
with
so
much
cover
bessie
answered
not
but
ere
long
addressing
me
she
said
you
ought
to
be
aware
miss
that
you
are
under
obligations
to
mrs
reed
she
keeps
you
if
she
were
to
turn
you
off
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
poorhouse
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
these
words
they
were
not
new
to
me
my
very
first
recollections
of
existence
included
hints
of
the
same
kind
this
reproach
of
my
dependence
had
become
a
vague
sing
song
in
my
ear
very
painful
and
crushing
but
only
half
intelligible
miss
abbot
joined
in
and
you
ought
not
to
think
yourself
on
an
equality
with
the
misses
reed
and
master
reed
because
missis
kindly
allows
you
to
be
brought
up
with
them
they
will
have
a
great
deal
of
money
and
you
will
have
none
it
is
your
place
to
be
humble
and
to
try
to
make
yourself
agreeable
to
them
what
we
tell
you
is
for
your
good
added
bessie
in
no
harsh
voice
you
should
try
to
be
useful
and
pleasant
then
perhaps
you
would
have
a
home
here
but
if
you
become
passionate
and
rude
missis
will
send
you
away
i
am
sure
besides
said
miss
abbot
god
will
punish
her
he
might
strike
her
dead
in
the
midst
of
her
tantrums
and
then
where
would
she
go
come
bessie
we
will
leave
her
i
wouldn
t
have
her
heart
for
anything
say
your
prayers
miss
eyre
when
you
are
by
yourself
for
if
you
don
t
repent
something
bad
might
be
permitted
to
come
down
the
chimney
and
fetch
you
away
they
went
shutting
the
door
and
locking
it
behind
them
the
red
room
was
a
square
chamber
very
seldom
slept
in
i
might
say
never
indeed
unless
when
a
chance
influx
of
visitors
at
gateshead
hall
rendered
it
necessary
to
turn
to
account
all
the
accommodation
it
contained
yet
it
was
one
of
the
largest
and
stateliest
chambers
in
the
mansion
a
bed
supported
on
massive
pillars
of
mahogany
hung
with
curtains
of
deep
red
damask
stood
out
like
a
tabernacle
in
the
centre
the
two
large
windows
with
their
blinds
always
drawn
down
were
half
shrouded
in
festoons
and
falls
of
similar
drapery
the
carpet
was
red
the
table
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
covered
with
a
crimson
cloth
the
walls
were
a
soft
fawn
colour
with
a
blush
of
pink
in
it
the
wardrobe
the
toilet
table
the
chairs
were
of
darkly
polished
old
mahogany
out
of
these
deep
surrounding
shades
rose
high
and
glared
white
the
piled
up
mattresses
and
pillows
of
the
bed
spread
with
a
snowy
marseilles
counterpane
scarcely
less
prominent
was
an
ample
cushioned
easy
chair
near
the
head
of
the
bed
also
white
with
a
footstool
before
it
and
looking
as
i
thought
like
a
pale
throne
this
room
was
chill
because
it
seldom
had
a
fire
it
was
silent
because
remote
from
the
nursery
and
kitchen
solemn
because
it
was
known
to
be
so
seldom
entered
the
house
maid
alone
came
here
on
saturdays
to
wipe
from
the
mirrors
and
the
furniture
a
week
s
quiet
dust
and
mrs
reed
herself
at
far
intervals
visited
it
to
review
the
contents
of
a
certain
secret
drawer
in
the
wardrobe
where
were
stored
divers
parchments
her
jewel
casket
and
a
miniature
of
her
deceased
husband
and
in
those
last
words
lies
the
secret
of
the
red
room
the
spell
which
kept
it
so
lonely
in
spite
of
its
grandeur
mr
reed
had
been
dead
nine
years
it
was
in
this
chamber
he
breathed
his
last
here
he
lay
in
state
hence
his
coffin
was
borne
by
the
undertaker
s
men
and
since
that
day
a
sense
of
dreary
consecration
had
guarded
it
from
frequent
intrusion
my
seat
to
which
bessie
and
the
bitter
miss
abbot
had
left
me
riveted
was
a
low
ottoman
near
the
marble
chimney
piece
the
bed
rose
before
me
to
my
right
hand
there
was
the
high
dark
wardrobe
with
subdued
broken
reflections
varying
the
gloss
of
its
panels
to
my
left
were
the
muffled
windows
a
great
looking
glass
between
them
repeated
the
vacant
majesty
of
the
bed
and
room
i
was
not
quite
sure
whether
they
had
locked
the
door
and
when
i
dared
move
i
got
up
and
went
to
see
alas
yes
no
jail
was
ever
more
secure
returning
i
had
to
cross
before
the
looking
glass
my
fascinated
glance
involuntarily
explored
the
depth
it
revealed
all
looked
colder
and
darker
in
that
visionary
hollow
than
in
reality
and
the
strange
little
figure
there
gazing
at
me
with
a
white
face
and
arms
specking
the
gloom
and
glittering
eyes
of
fear
moving
where
all
else
was
still
had
the
effect
of
a
real
spirit
i
thought
it
like
one
of
the
tiny
phantoms
half
fairy
half
imp
bessie
s
evening
stories
represented
as
coming
out
of
lone
ferny
dells
in
moors
and
appearing
before
the
eyes
of
belated
travellers
i
returned
to
my
stool
superstition
was
with
me
at
that
moment
but
it
was
not
yet
her
hour
for
complete
victory
my
blood
was
still
warm
the
mood
of
the
revolted
slave
was
still
bracing
me
with
its
bitter
vigour
i
had
to
stem
a
rapid
rush
of
retrospective
thought
before
i
quailed
to
the
dismal
present
all
john
reed
s
violent
tyrannies
all
his
sisters
proud
indifference
all
his
mother
s
aversion
all
the
servants
partiality
turned
up
in
my
disturbed
mind
like
a
dark
deposit
in
a
turbid
well
why
was
i
always
suffering
always
browbeaten
always
accused
for
ever
condemned
why
could
i
never
please
why
was
it
useless
to
try
to
win
any
one
s
favour
eliza
who
was
headstrong
and
selfish
was
respected
georgiana
who
had
a
spoiled
temper
a
very
acrid
spite
a
captious
and
insolent
carriage
was
universally
indulged
her
beauty
her
pink
cheeks
and
golden
curls
seemed
to
give
delight
to
all
who
looked
at
her
and
to
purchase
indemnity
for
every
fault
john
no
one
thwarted
much
less
punished
though
he
twisted
the
necks
of
the
pigeons
killed
the
little
pea
chicks
set
the
dogs
at
the
sheep
stripped
the
hothouse
vines
of
their
fruit
and
broke
the
buds
off
the
choicest
plants
in
the
conservatory
he
called
his
mother
old
girl
too
sometimes
reviled
her
for
her
dark
skin
similar
to
his
own
bluntly
disregarded
her
wishes
not
unfrequently
tore
and
spoiled
her
silk
attire
and
he
was
still
her
own
darling
i
dared
commit
no
fault
i
strove
to
fulfil
every
duty
and
i
was
termed
naughty
and
tiresome
sullen
and
sneaking
from
morning
to
noon
and
from
noon
to
night
my
head
still
ached
and
bled
with
the
blow
and
fall
i
had
received
no
one
had
reproved
john
for
wantonly
striking
me
and
because
i
had
turned
against
him
to
avert
farther
irrational
violence
i
was
loaded
with
general
opprobrium
unjust
unjust
said
my
reason
forced
by
the
agonising
stimulus
into
precocious
though
transitory
power
and
resolve
equally
wrought
up
instigated
some
strange
expedient
to
achieve
escape
from
insupportable
oppression
as
running
away
or
if
that
could
not
be
effected
never
eating
or
drinking
more
and
letting
myself
die
what
a
consternation
of
soul
was
mine
that
dreary
afternoon
how
all
my
brain
was
in
tumult
and
all
my
heart
in
insurrection
yet
in
what
darkness
what
dense
ignorance
was
the
mental
battle
fought
i
could
not
answer
the
ceaseless
inward
question
why
i
thus
suffered
now
at
the
distance
of
i
will
not
say
how
many
years
i
see
it
clearly
i
was
a
discord
in
gateshead
hall
i
was
like
nobody
there
i
had
nothing
in
harmony
with
mrs
reed
or
her
children
or
her
chosen
vassalage
if
they
did
not
love
me
in
fact
as
little
did
i
love
them
they
were
not
bound
to
regard
with
affection
a
thing
that
could
not
sympathise
with
one
amongst
them
a
heterogeneous
thing
opposed
to
them
in
temperament
in
capacity
in
propensities
a
useless
thing
incapable
of
serving
their
interest
or
adding
to
their
pleasure
a
noxious
thing
cherishing
the
germs
of
indignation
at
their
treatment
of
contempt
of
their
judgment
i
know
that
had
i
been
a
sanguine
brilliant
careless
exacting
handsome
romping
child
though
equally
dependent
and
friendless
mrs
reed
would
have
endured
my
presence
more
complacently
her
children
would
have
entertained
for
me
more
of
the
cordiality
of
fellow
feeling
the
servants
would
have
been
less
prone
to
make
me
the
scapegoat
of
the
nursery
daylight
began
to
forsake
the
red
room
it
was
past
four
o
clock
and
the
beclouded
afternoon
was
tending
to
drear
twilight
i
heard
the
rain
still
beating
continuously
on
the
staircase
window
and
the
wind
howling
in
the
grove
behind
the
hall
i
grew
by
degrees
cold
as
a
stone
and
then
my
courage
sank
my
habitual
mood
of
humiliation
self
doubt
forlorn
depression
fell
damp
on
the
embers
of
my
decaying
ire
all
said
i
was
wicked
and
perhaps
i
might
be
so
what
thought
had
i
been
but
just
conceiving
of
starving
myself
to
death
that
certainly
was
a
crime
and
was
i
fit
to
die
or
was
the
vault
under
the
chancel
of
gateshead
church
an
inviting
bourne
in
such
vault
i
had
been
told
did
mr
reed
lie
buried
and
led
by
this
thought
to
recall
his
idea
i
dwelt
on
it
with
gathering
dread
i
could
not
remember
him
but
i
knew
that
he
was
my
own
uncle
my
mother
s
brother
that
he
had
taken
me
when
a
parentless
infant
to
his
house
and
that
in
his
last
moments
he
had
required
a
promise
of
mrs
reed
that
she
would
rear
and
maintain
me
as
one
of
her
own
children
mrs
reed
probably
considered
she
had
kept
this
promise
and
so
she
had
i
dare
say
as
well
as
her
nature
would
permit
her
but
how
could
she
really
like
an
interloper
not
of
her
race
and
unconnected
with
her
after
her
husband
s
death
by
any
tie
it
must
have
been
most
irksome
to
find
herself
bound
by
a
hard
wrung
pledge
to
stand
in
the
stead
of
a
parent
to
a
strange
child
she
could
not
love
and
to
see
an
uncongenial
alien
permanently
intruded
on
her
own
family
group
a
singular
notion
dawned
upon
me
i
doubted
not
never
doubted
that
if
mr
reed
had
been
alive
he
would
have
treated
me
kindly
and
now
as
i
sat
looking
at
the
white
bed
and
overshadowed
walls
occasionally
also
turning
a
fascinated
eye
towards
the
dimly
gleaning
mirror
i
began
to
recall
what
i
had
heard
of
dead
men
troubled
in
their
graves
by
the
violation
of
their
last
wishes
revisiting
the
earth
to
punish
the
perjured
and
avenge
the
oppressed
and
i
thought
mr
reed
s
spirit
harassed
by
the
wrongs
of
his
sister
s
child
might
quit
its
abode
whether
in
the
church
vault
or
in
the
unknown
world
of
the
departed
and
rise
before
me
in
this
chamber
i
wiped
my
tears
and
hushed
my
sobs
fearful
lest
any
sign
of
violent
grief
might
waken
a
preternatural
voice
to
comfort
me
or
elicit
from
the
gloom
some
haloed
face
bending
over
me
with
strange
pity
this
idea
consolatory
in
theory
i
felt
would
be
terrible
if
realised
with
all
my
might
i
endeavoured
to
stifle
it
i
endeavoured
to
be
firm
shaking
my
hair
from
my
eyes
i
lifted
my
head
and
tried
to
look
boldly
round
the
dark
room
at
this
moment
a
light
gleamed
on
the
wall
was
it
i
asked
myself
a
ray
from
the
moon
penetrating
some
aperture
in
the
blind
no
moonlight
was
still
and
this
stirred
while
i
gazed
it
glided
up
to
the
ceiling
and
quivered
over
my
head
i
can
now
conjecture
readily
that
this
streak
of
light
was
in
all
likelihood
a
gleam
from
a
lantern
carried
by
some
one
across
the
lawn
but
then
prepared
as
my
mind
was
for
horror
shaken
as
my
nerves
were
by
agitation
i
thought
the
swift
darting
beam
was
a
herald
of
some
coming
vision
from
another
world
my
heart
beat
thick
my
head
grew
hot
a
sound
filled
my
ears
which
i
deemed
the
rushing
of
wings
something
seemed
near
me
i
was
oppressed
suffocated
endurance
broke
down
i
rushed
to
the
door
and
shook
the
lock
in
desperate
effort
steps
came
running
along
the
outer
passage
the
key
turned
bessie
and
abbot
entered
miss
eyre
are
you
ill
said
bessie
what
a
dreadful
noise
it
went
quite
through
me
exclaimed
abbot
take
me
out
let
me
go
into
the
nursery
was
my
cry
what
for
are
you
hurt
have
you
seen
something
again
demanded
bessie
oh
i
saw
a
light
and
i
thought
a
ghost
would
come
i
had
now
got
hold
of
bessie
s
hand
and
she
did
not
snatch
it
from
me
she
has
screamed
out
on
purpose
declared
abbot
in
some
disgust
and
what
a
scream
if
she
had
been
in
great
pain
one
would
have
excused
it
but
she
only
wanted
to
bring
us
all
here
i
know
her
naughty
tricks
what
is
all
this
demanded
another
voice
peremptorily
and
mrs
reed
came
along
the
corridor
her
cap
flying
wide
her
gown
rustling
stormily
abbot
and
bessie
i
believe
i
gave
orders
that
jane
eyre
should
be
left
in
the
red
room
till
i
came
to
her
myself
miss
jane
screamed
so
loud
ma
am
pleaded
bessie
let
her
go
was
the
only
answer
loose
bessie
s
hand
child
you
cannot
succeed
in
getting
out
by
these
means
be
assured
i
abhor
artifice
particularly
in
children
it
is
my
duty
to
show
you
that
tricks
will
not
answer
you
will
now
stay
here
an
hour
longer
and
it
is
only
on
condition
of
perfect
submission
and
stillness
that
i
shall
liberate
you
then
o
aunt
have
pity
forgive
me
i
cannot
endure
it
let
me
be
punished
some
other
way
i
shall
be
killed
if
silence
this
violence
is
all
most
repulsive
and
so
no
doubt
she
felt
it
i
was
a
precocious
actress
in
her
eyes
she
sincerely
looked
on
me
as
a
compound
of
virulent
passions
mean
spirit
and
dangerous
duplicity
bessie
and
abbot
having
retreated
mrs
reed
impatient
of
my
now
frantic
anguish
and
wild
sobs
abruptly
thrust
me
back
and
locked
me
in
without
farther
parley
i
heard
her
sweeping
away
and
soon
after
she
was
gone
i
suppose
i
had
a
species
of
fit
unconsciousness
closed
the
scene
chapter
iii
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
waking
up
with
a
feeling
as
if
i
had
had
a
frightful
nightmare
and
seeing
before
me
a
terrible
red
glare
crossed
with
thick
black
bars
i
heard
voices
too
speaking
with
a
hollow
sound
and
as
if
muffled
by
a
rush
of
wind
or
water
agitation
uncertainty
and
an
all
predominating
sense
of
terror
confused
my
faculties
ere
long
i
became
aware
that
some
one
was
handling
me
lifting
me
up
and
supporting
me
in
a
sitting
posture
and
that
more
tenderly
than
i
had
ever
been
raised
or
upheld
before
i
rested
my
head
against
a
pillow
or
an
arm
and
felt
easy
in
five
minutes
more
the
cloud
of
bewilderment
dissolved
i
knew
quite
well
that
i
was
in
my
own
bed
and
that
the
red
glare
was
the
nursery
fire
it
was
night
a
candle
burnt
on
the
table
bessie
stood
at
the
bed
foot
with
a
basin
in
her
hand
and
a
gentleman
sat
in
a
chair
near
my
pillow
leaning
over
me
i
felt
an
inexpressible
relief
a
soothing
conviction
of
protection
and
security
when
i
knew
that
there
was
a
stranger
in
the
room
an
individual
not
belonging
to
gateshead
and
not
related
to
mrs
reed
turning
from
bessie
though
her
presence
was
far
less
obnoxious
to
me
than
that
of
abbot
for
instance
would
have
been
i
scrutinised
the
face
of
the
gentleman
i
knew
him
it
was
mr
lloyd
an
apothecary
sometimes
called
in
by
mrs
reed
when
the
servants
were
ailing
for
herself
and
the
children
she
employed
a
physician
well
who
am
i
he
asked
i
pronounced
his
name
offering
him
at
the
same
time
my
hand
he
took
it
smiling
and
saying
we
shall
do
very
well
by
and
by
then
he
laid
me
down
and
addressing
bessie
charged
her
to
be
very
careful
that
i
was
not
disturbed
during
the
night
having
given
some
further
directions
and
intimates
that
he
should
call
again
the
next
day
he
departed
to
my
grief
i
felt
so
sheltered
and
befriended
while
he
sat
in
the
chair
near
my
pillow
and
as
he
closed
the
door
after
him
all
the
room
darkened
and
my
heart
again
sank
inexpressible
sadness
weighed
it
down
do
you
feel
as
if
you
should
sleep
miss
asked
bessie
rather
softly
scarcely
dared
i
answer
her
for
i
feared
the
next
sentence
might
be
rough
i
will
try
would
you
like
to
drink
or
could
you
eat
anything
no
thank
you
bessie
then
i
think
i
shall
go
to
bed
for
it
is
past
twelve
o
clock
but
you
may
call
me
if
you
want
anything
in
the
night
wonderful
civility
this
it
emboldened
me
to
ask
a
question
bessie
what
is
the
matter
with
me
am
i
ill
you
fell
sick
i
suppose
in
the
red
room
with
crying
you
ll
be
better
soon
no
doubt
bessie
went
into
the
housemaid
s
apartment
which
was
near
i
heard
her
say
sarah
come
and
sleep
with
me
in
the
nursery
i
daren
t
for
my
life
be
alone
with
that
poor
child
to
night
she
might
die
it
s
such
a
strange
thing
she
should
have
that
fit
i
wonder
if
she
saw
anything
missis
was
rather
too
hard
sarah
came
back
with
her
they
both
went
to
bed
they
were
whispering
together
for
half
an
hour
before
they
fell
asleep
i
caught
scraps
of
their
conversation
from
which
i
was
able
only
too
distinctly
to
infer
the
main
subject
discussed
something
passed
her
all
dressed
in
white
and
vanished
a
great
black
dog
behind
him
three
loud
raps
on
the
chamber
door
a
light
in
the
churchyard
just
over
his
grave
c
c
at
last
both
slept
the
fire
and
the
candle
went
out
for
me
the
watches
of
that
long
night
passed
in
ghastly
wakefulness
strained
by
dread
such
dread
as
children
only
can
feel
no
severe
or
prolonged
bodily
illness
followed
this
incident
of
the
red
room
it
only
gave
my
nerves
a
shock
of
which
i
feel
the
reverberation
to
this
day
yes
mrs
reed
to
you
i
owe
some
fearful
pangs
of
mental
suffering
but
i
ought
to
forgive
you
for
you
knew
not
what
you
did
while
rending
my
heart
strings
you
thought
you
were
only
uprooting
my
bad
propensities
next
day
by
noon
i
was
up
and
dressed
and
sat
wrapped
in
a
shawl
by
the
nursery
hearth
i
felt
physically
weak
and
broken
down
but
my
worse
ailment
was
an
unutterable
wretchedness
of
mind
a
wretchedness
which
kept
drawing
from
me
silent
tears
no
sooner
had
i
wiped
one
salt
drop
from
my
cheek
than
another
followed
yet
i
thought
i
ought
to
have
been
happy
for
none
of
the
reeds
were
there
they
were
all
gone
out
in
the
carriage
with
their
mama
abbot
too
was
sewing
in
another
room
and
bessie
as
she
moved
hither
and
thither
putting
away
toys
and
arranging
drawers
addressed
to
me
every
now
and
then
a
word
of
unwonted
kindness
this
state
of
things
should
have
been
to
me
a
paradise
of
peace
accustomed
as
i
was
to
a
life
of
ceaseless
reprimand
and
thankless
fagging
but
in
fact
my
racked
nerves
were
now
in
such
a
state
that
no
calm
could
soothe
and
no
pleasure
excite
them
agreeably
bessie
had
been
down
into
the
kitchen
and
she
brought
up
with
her
a
tart
on
a
certain
brightly
painted
china
plate
whose
bird
of
paradise
nestling
in
a
wreath
of
convolvuli
and
rosebuds
had
been
wont
to
stir
in
me
a
most
enthusiastic
sense
of
admiration
and
which
plate
i
had
often
petitioned
to
be
allowed
to
take
in
my
hand
in
order
to
examine
it
more
closely
but
had
always
hitherto
been
deemed
unworthy
of
such
a
privilege
this
precious
vessel
was
now
placed
on
my
knee
and
i
was
cordially
invited
to
eat
the
circlet
of
delicate
pastry
upon
it
vain
favour
coming
like
most
other
favours
long
deferred
and
often
wished
for
too
late
i
could
not
eat
the
tart
and
the
plumage
of
the
bird
the
tints
of
the
flowers
seemed
strangely
faded
i
put
both
plate
and
tart
away
bessie
asked
if
i
would
have
a
book
the
word
book
acted
as
a
transient
stimulus
and
i
begged
her
to
fetch
gulliver
s
travels
from
the
library
this
book
i
had
again
and
again
perused
with
delight
i
considered
it
a
narrative
of
facts
and
discovered
in
it
a
vein
of
interest
deeper
than
what
i
found
in
fairy
tales
for
as
to
the
elves
having
sought
them
in
vain
among
foxglove
leaves
and
bells
under
mushrooms
and
beneath
the
ground
ivy
mantling
old
wall
nooks
i
had
at
length
made
up
my
mind
to
the
sad
truth
that
they
were
all
gone
out
of
england
to
some
savage
country
where
the
woods
were
wilder
and
thicker
and
the
population
more
scant
whereas
lilliput
and
brobdignag
being
in
my
creed
solid
parts
of
the
earth
s
surface
i
doubted
not
that
i
might
one
day
by
taking
a
long
voyage
see
with
my
own
eyes
the
little
fields
houses
and
trees
the
diminutive
people
the
tiny
cows
sheep
and
birds
of
the
one
realm
and
the
corn
fields
forest
high
the
mighty
mastiffs
the
monster
cats
the
tower
like
men
and
women
of
the
other
yet
when
this
cherished
volume
was
now
placed
in
my
hand
when
i
turned
over
its
leaves
and
sought
in
its
marvellous
pictures
the
charm
i
had
till
now
never
failed
to
find
all
was
eerie
and
dreary
the
giants
were
gaunt
goblins
the
pigmies
malevolent
and
fearful
imps
gulliver
a
most
desolate
wanderer
in
most
dread
and
dangerous
regions
i
closed
the
book
which
i
dared
no
longer
peruse
and
put
it
on
the
table
beside
the
untasted
tart
bessie
had
now
finished
dusting
and
tidying
the
room
and
having
washed
her
hands
she
opened
a
certain
little
drawer
full
of
splendid
shreds
of
silk
and
satin
and
began
making
a
new
bonnet
for
georgiana
s
doll
meantime
she
sang
her
song
was
in
the
days
when
we
went
gipsying
a
long
time
ago
i
had
often
heard
the
song
before
and
always
with
lively
delight
for
bessie
had
a
sweet
voice
at
least
i
thought
so
but
now
though
her
voice
was
still
sweet
i
found
in
its
melody
an
indescribable
sadness
sometimes
preoccupied
with
her
work
she
sang
the
refrain
very
low
very
lingeringly
a
long
time
ago
came
out
like
the
saddest
cadence
of
a
funeral
hymn
she
passed
into
another
ballad
this
time
a
really
doleful
one
my
feet
they
are
sore
and
my
limbs
they
are
weary
long
is
the
way
and
the
mountains
are
wild
soon
will
the
twilight
close
moonless
and
dreary
over
the
path
of
the
poor
orphan
child
why
did
they
send
me
so
far
and
so
lonely
up
where
the
moors
spread
and
grey
rocks
are
piled
men
are
hard
hearted
and
kind
angels
only
watch
o
er
the
steps
of
a
poor
orphan
child
yet
distant
and
soft
the
night
breeze
is
blowing
clouds
there
are
none
and
clear
stars
beam
mild
god
in
his
mercy
protection
is
showing
comfort
and
hope
to
the
poor
orphan
child
ev
n
should
i
fall
o
er
the
broken
bridge
passing
or
stray
in
the
marshes
by
false
lights
beguiled
still
will
my
father
with
promise
and
blessing
take
to
his
bosom
the
poor
orphan
child
there
is
a
thought
that
for
strength
should
avail
me
though
both
of
shelter
and
kindred
despoiled
heaven
is
a
home
and
a
rest
will
not
fail
me
god
is
a
friend
to
the
poor
orphan
child
come
miss
jane
don
t
cry
said
bessie
as
she
finished
she
might
as
well
have
said
to
the
fire
don
t
burn
but
how
could
she
divine
the
morbid
suffering
to
which
i
was
a
prey
in
the
course
of
the
morning
mr
lloyd
came
again
what
already
up
said
he
as
he
entered
the
nursery
well
nurse
how
is
she
bessie
answered
that
i
was
doing
very
well
then
she
ought
to
look
more
cheerful
come
here
miss
jane
your
name
is
jane
is
it
not
yes
sir
jane
eyre
well
you
have
been
crying
miss
jane
eyre
can
you
tell
me
what
about
have
you
any
pain
no
sir
oh
i
daresay
she
is
crying
because
she
could
not
go
out
with
missis
in
the
carriage
interposed
bessie
surely
not
why
she
is
too
old
for
such
pettishness
i
thought
so
too
and
my
self
esteem
being
wounded
by
the
false
charge
i
answered
promptly
i
never
cried
for
such
a
thing
in
my
life
i
hate
going
out
in
the
carriage
i
cry
because
i
am
miserable
oh
fie
miss
said
bessie
the
good
apothecary
appeared
a
little
puzzled
i
was
standing
before
him
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
very
steadily
his
eyes
were
small
and
grey
not
very
bright
but
i
dare
say
i
should
think
them
shrewd
now
he
had
a
hard
featured
yet
good
natured
looking
face
having
considered
me
at
leisure
he
said
what
made
you
ill
yesterday
she
had
a
fall
said
bessie
again
putting
in
her
word
fall
why
that
is
like
a
baby
again
can
t
she
manage
to
walk
at
her
age
she
must
be
eight
or
nine
years
old
i
was
knocked
down
was
the
blunt
explanation
jerked
out
of
me
by
another
pang
of
mortified
pride
but
that
did
not
make
me
ill
i
added
while
mr
lloyd
helped
himself
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
as
he
was
returning
the
box
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
loud
bell
rang
for
the
servants
dinner
he
knew
what
it
was
that
s
for
you
nurse
said
he
you
can
go
down
i
ll
give
miss
jane
a
lecture
till
you
come
back
bessie
would
rather
have
stayed
but
she
was
obliged
to
go
because
punctuality
at
meals
was
rigidly
enforced
at
gateshead
hall
the
fall
did
not
make
you
ill
what
did
then
pursued
mr
lloyd
when
bessie
was
gone
i
was
shut
up
in
a
room
where
there
is
a
ghost
till
after
dark
i
saw
mr
lloyd
smile
and
frown
at
the
same
time
ghost
what
you
are
a
baby
after
all
you
are
afraid
of
ghosts
of
mr
reed
s
ghost
i
am
he
died
in
that
room
and
was
laid
out
there
neither
bessie
nor
any
one
else
will
go
into
it
at
night
if
they
can
help
it
and
it
was
cruel
to
shut
me
up
alone
without
a
candle
so
cruel
that
i
think
i
shall
never
forget
it
nonsense
and
is
it
that
makes
you
so
miserable
are
you
afraid
now
in
daylight
no
but
night
will
come
again
before
long
and
besides
i
am
unhappy
very
unhappy
for
other
things
what
other
things
can
you
tell
me
some
of
them
how
much
i
wished
to
reply
fully
to
this
question
how
difficult
it
was
to
frame
any
answer
children
can
feel
but
they
cannot
analyse
their
feelings
and
if
the
analysis
is
partially
effected
in
thought
they
know
not
how
to
express
the
result
of
the
process
in
words
fearful
however
of
losing
this
first
and
only
opportunity
of
relieving
my
grief
by
imparting
it
i
after
a
disturbed
pause
contrived
to
frame
a
meagre
though
as
far
as
it
went
true
response
for
one
thing
i
have
no
father
or
mother
brothers
or
sisters
you
have
a
kind
aunt
and
cousins
again
i
paused
then
bunglingly
enounced
but
john
reed
knocked
me
down
and
my
aunt
shut
me
up
in
the
red
room
mr
lloyd
a
second
time
produced
his
snuff
box
don
t
you
think
gateshead
hall
a
very
beautiful
house
asked
he
are
you
not
very
thankful
to
have
such
a
fine
place
to
live
at
it
is
not
my
house
sir
and
abbot
says
i
have
less
right
to
be
here
than
a
servant
pooh
you
can
t
be
silly
enough
to
wish
to
leave
such
a
splendid
place
if
i
had
anywhere
else
to
go
i
should
be
glad
to
leave
it
but
i
can
never
get
away
from
gateshead
till
i
am
a
woman
perhaps
you
may
who
knows
have
you
any
relations
besides
mrs
reed
i
think
not
sir
none
belonging
to
your
father
i
don
t
know
i
asked
aunt
reed
once
and
she
said
possibly
i
might
have
some
poor
low
relations
called
eyre
but
she
knew
nothing
about
them
if
you
had
such
would
you
like
to
go
to
them
i
reflected
poverty
looks
grim
to
grown
people
still
more
so
to
children
they
have
not
much
idea
of
industrious
working
respectable
poverty
they
think
of
the
word
only
as
connected
with
ragged
clothes
scanty
food
fireless
grates
rude
manners
and
debasing
vices
poverty
for
me
was
synonymous
with
degradation
no
i
should
not
like
to
belong
to
poor
people
was
my
reply
not
even
if
they
were
kind
to
you
i
shook
my
head
i
could
not
see
how
poor
people
had
the
means
of
being
kind
and
then
to
learn
to
speak
like
them
to
adopt
their
manners
to
be
uneducated
to
grow
up
like
one
of
the
poor
women
i
saw
sometimes
nursing
their
children
or
washing
their
clothes
at
the
cottage
doors
of
the
village
of
gateshead
no
i
was
not
heroic
enough
to
purchase
liberty
at
the
price
of
caste
but
are
your
relatives
so
very
poor
are
they
working
people
i
cannot
tell
aunt
reed
says
if
i
have
any
they
must
be
a
beggarly
set
i
should
not
like
to
go
a
begging
would
you
like
to
go
to
school
again
i
reflected
i
scarcely
knew
what
school
was
bessie
sometimes
spoke
of
it
as
a
place
where
young
ladies
sat
in
the
stocks
wore
backboards
and
were
expected
to
be
exceedingly
genteel
and
precise
john
reed
hated
his
school
and
abused
his
master
but
john
reed
s
tastes
were
no
rule
for
mine
and
if
bessie
s
accounts
of
school
discipline
gathered
from
the
young
ladies
of
a
family
where
she
had
lived
before
coming
to
gateshead
were
somewhat
appalling
her
details
of
certain
accomplishments
attained
by
these
same
young
ladies
were
i
thought
equally
attractive
she
boasted
of
beautiful
paintings
of
landscapes
and
flowers
by
them
executed
of
songs
they
could
sing
and
pieces
they
could
play
of
purses
they
could
net
of
french
books
they
could
translate
till
my
spirit
was
moved
to
emulation
as
i
listened
besides
school
would
be
a
complete
change
it
implied
a
long
journey
an
entire
separation
from
gateshead
an
entrance
into
a
new
life
i
should
indeed
like
to
go
to
school
was
the
audible
conclusion
of
my
musings
well
well
who
knows
what
may
happen
said
mr
lloyd
as
he
got
up
the
child
ought
to
have
change
of
air
and
scene
he
added
speaking
to
himself
nerves
not
in
a
good
state
bessie
now
returned
at
the
same
moment
the
carriage
was
heard
rolling
up
the
gravel
walk
is
that
your
mistress
nurse
asked
mr
lloyd
i
should
like
to
speak
to
her
before
i
go
bessie
invited
him
to
walk
into
the
breakfast
room
and
led
the
way
out
in
the
interview
which
followed
between
him
and
mrs
reed
i
presume
from
after
occurrences
that
the
apothecary
ventured
to
recommend
my
being
sent
to
school
and
the
recommendation
was
no
doubt
readily
enough
adopted
for
as
abbot
said
in
discussing
the
subject
with
bessie
when
both
sat
sewing
in
the
nursery
one
night
after
i
was
in
bed
and
as
they
thought
asleep
missis
was
she
dared
say
glad
enough
to
get
rid
of
such
a
tiresome
ill
conditioned
child
who
always
looked
as
if
she
were
watching
everybody
and
scheming
plots
underhand
abbot
i
think
gave
me
credit
for
being
a
sort
of
infantine
guy
fawkes
on
that
same
occasion
i
learned
for
the
first
time
from
miss
abbot
s
communications
to
bessie
that
my
father
had
been
a
poor
clergyman
that
my
mother
had
married
him
against
the
wishes
of
her
friends
who
considered
the
match
beneath
her
that
my
grandfather
reed
was
so
irritated
at
her
disobedience
he
cut
her
off
without
a
shilling
that
after
my
mother
and
father
had
been
married
a
year
the
latter
caught
the
typhus
fever
while
visiting
among
the
poor
of
a
large
manufacturing
town
where
his
curacy
was
situated
and
where
that
disease
was
then
prevalent
that
my
mother
took
the
infection
from
him
and
both
died
within
a
month
of
each
other
bessie
when
she
heard
this
narrative
sighed
and
said
poor
miss
jane
is
to
be
pitied
too
abbot
yes
responded
abbot
if
she
were
a
nice
pretty
child
one
might
compassionate
her
forlornness
but
one
really
cannot
care
for
such
a
little
toad
as
that
not
a
great
deal
to
be
sure
agreed
bessie
at
any
rate
a
beauty
like
miss
georgiana
would
be
more
moving
in
the
same
condition
yes
i
doat
on
miss
georgiana
cried
the
fervent
abbot
little
darling
with
her
long
curls
and
her
blue
eyes
and
such
a
sweet
colour
as
she
has
just
as
if
she
were
painted
bessie
i
could
fancy
a
welsh
rabbit
for
supper
so
could
i
with
a
roast
onion
come
we
ll
go
down
they
went
chapter
iv
from
my
discourse
with
mr
lloyd
and
from
the
above
reported
conference
between
bessie
and
abbot
i
gathered
enough
of
hope
to
suffice
as
a
motive
for
wishing
to
get
well
a
change
seemed
near
i
desired
and
waited
it
in
silence
it
tarried
however
days
and
weeks
passed
i
had
regained
my
normal
state
of
health
but
no
new
allusion
was
made
to
the
subject
over
which
i
brooded
mrs
reed
surveyed
me
at
times
with
a
severe
eye
but
seldom
addressed
me
since
my
illness
she
had
drawn
a
more
marked
line
of
separation
than
ever
between
me
and
her
own
children
appointing
me
a
small
closet
to
sleep
in
by
myself
condemning
me
to
take
my
meals
alone
and
pass
all
my
time
in
the
nursery
while
my
cousins
were
constantly
in
the
drawing
room
not
a
hint
however
did
she
drop
about
sending
me
to
school
still
i
felt
an
instinctive
certainty
that
she
would
not
long
endure
me
under
the
same
roof
with
her
for
her
glance
now
more
than
ever
when
turned
on
me
expressed
an
insuperable
and
rooted
aversion
eliza
and
georgiana
evidently
acting
according
to
orders
spoke
to
me
as
little
as
possible
john
thrust
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
whenever
he
saw
me
and
once
attempted
chastisement
but
as
i
instantly
turned
against
him
roused
by
the
same
sentiment
of
deep
ire
and
desperate
revolt
which
had
stirred
my
corruption
before
he
thought
it
better
to
desist
and
ran
from
me
tittering
execrations
and
vowing
i
had
burst
his
nose
i
had
indeed
levelled
at
that
prominent
feature
as
hard
a
blow
as
my
knuckles
could
inflict
and
when
i
saw
that
either
that
or
my
look
daunted
him
i
had
the
greatest
inclination
to
follow
up
my
advantage
to
purpose
but
he
was
already
with
his
mama
i
heard
him
in
a
blubbering
tone
commence
the
tale
of
how
that
nasty
jane
eyre
had
flown
at
him
like
a
mad
cat
he
was
stopped
rather
harshly
don
t
talk
to
me
about
her
john
i
told
you
not
to
go
near
her
she
is
not
worthy
of
notice
i
do
not
choose
that
either
you
or
your
sisters
should
associate
with
her
here
leaning
over
the
banister
i
cried
out
suddenly
and
without
at
all
deliberating
on
my
words
they
are
not
fit
to
associate
with
me
mrs
reed
was
rather
a
stout
woman
but
on
hearing
this
strange
and
audacious
declaration
she
ran
nimbly
up
the
stair
swept
me
like
a
whirlwind
into
the
nursery
and
crushing
me
down
on
the
edge
of
my
crib
dared
me
in
an
emphatic
voice
to
rise
from
that
place
or
utter
one
syllable
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
what
would
uncle
reed
say
to
you
if
he
were
alive
was
my
scarcely
voluntary
demand
i
say
scarcely
voluntary
for
it
seemed
as
if
my
tongue
pronounced
words
without
my
will
consenting
to
their
utterance
something
spoke
out
of
me
over
which
i
had
no
control
what
said
mrs
reed
under
her
breath
her
usually
cold
composed
grey
eye
became
troubled
with
a
look
like
fear
she
took
her
hand
from
my
arm
and
gazed
at
me
as
if
she
really
did
not
know
whether
i
were
child
or
fiend
i
was
now
in
for
it
my
uncle
reed
is
in
heaven
and
can
see
all
you
do
and
think
and
so
can
papa
and
mama
they
know
how
you
shut
me
up
all
day
long
and
how
you
wish
me
dead
mrs
reed
soon
rallied
her
spirits
she
shook
me
most
soundly
she
boxed
both
my
ears
and
then
left
me
without
a
word
bessie
supplied
the
hiatus
by
a
homily
of
an
hour
s
length
in
which
she
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
i
was
the
most
wicked
and
abandoned
child
ever
reared
under
a
roof
i
half
believed
her
for
i
felt
indeed
only
bad
feelings
surging
in
my
breast
november
december
and
half
of
january
passed
away
christmas
and
the
new
year
had
been
celebrated
at
gateshead
with
the
usual
festive
cheer
presents
had
been
interchanged
dinners
and
evening
parties
given
from
every
enjoyment
i
was
of
course
excluded
my
share
of
the
gaiety
consisted
in
witnessing
the
daily
apparelling
of
eliza
and
georgiana
and
seeing
them
descend
to
the
drawing
room
dressed
out
in
thin
muslin
frocks
and
scarlet
sashes
with
hair
elaborately
ringletted
and
afterwards
in
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
piano
or
the
harp
played
below
to
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
the
butler
and
footman
to
the
jingling
of
glass
and
china
as
refreshments
were
handed
to
the
broken
hum
of
conversation
as
the
drawing
room
door
opened
and
closed
when
tired
of
this
occupation
i
would
retire
from
the
stairhead
to
the
solitary
and
silent
nursery
there
though
somewhat
sad
i
was
not
miserable
to
speak
truth
i
had
not
the
least
wish
to
go
into
company
for
in
company
i
was
very
rarely
noticed
and
if
bessie
had
but
been
kind
and
companionable
i
should
have
deemed
it
a
treat
to
spend
the
evenings
quietly
with
her
instead
of
passing
them
under
the
formidable
eye
of
mrs
reed
in
a
room
full
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
but
bessie
as
soon
as
she
had
dressed
her
young
ladies
used
to
take
herself
off
to
the
lively
regions
of
the
kitchen
and
housekeeper
s
room
generally
bearing
the
candle
along
with
her
i
then
sat
with
my
doll
on
my
knee
till
the
fire
got
low
glancing
round
occasionally
to
make
sure
that
nothing
worse
than
myself
haunted
the
shadowy
room
and
when
the
embers
sank
to
a
dull
red
i
undressed
hastily
tugging
at
knots
and
strings
as
i
best
might
and
sought
shelter
from
cold
and
darkness
in
my
crib
to
this
crib
i
always
took
my
doll
human
beings
must
love
something
and
in
the
dearth
of
worthier
objects
of
affection
i
contrived
to
find
a
pleasure
in
loving
and
cherishing
a
faded
graven
image
shabby
as
a
miniature
scarecrow
it
puzzles
me
now
to
remember
with
what
absurd
sincerity
i
doated
on
this
little
toy
half
fancying
it
alive
and
capable
of
sensation
i
could
not
sleep
unless
it
was
folded
in
my
night
gown
and
when
it
lay
there
safe
and
warm
i
was
comparatively
happy
believing
it
to
be
happy
likewise
long
did
the
hours
seem
while
i
waited
the
departure
of
the
company
and
listened
for
the
sound
of
bessie
s
step
on
the
stairs
sometimes
she
would
come
up
in
the
interval
to
seek
her
thimble
or
her
scissors
or
perhaps
to
bring
me
something
by
way
of
supper
a
bun
or
a
cheese
cake
then
she
would
sit
on
the
bed
while
i
ate
it
and
when
i
had
finished
she
would
tuck
the
clothes
round
me
and
twice
she
kissed
me
and
said
good
night
miss
jane
when
thus
gentle
bessie
seemed
to
me
the
best
prettiest
kindest
being
in
the
world
and
i
wished
most
intensely
that
she
would
always
be
so
pleasant
and
amiable
and
never
push
me
about
or
scold
or
task
me
unreasonably
as
she
was
too
often
wont
to
do
bessie
lee
must
i
think
have
been
a
girl
of
good
natural
capacity
for
she
was
smart
in
all
she
did
and
had
a
remarkable
knack
of
narrative
so
at
least
i
judge
from
the
impression
made
on
me
by
her
nursery
tales
she
was
pretty
too
if
my
recollections
of
her
face
and
person
are
correct
i
remember
her
as
a
slim
young
woman
with
black
hair
dark
eyes
very
nice
features
and
good
clear
complexion
but
she
had
a
capricious
and
hasty
temper
and
indifferent
ideas
of
principle
or
justice
still
such
as
she
was
i
preferred
her
to
any
one
else
at
gateshead
hall
it
was
the
fifteenth
of
january
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
bessie
was
gone
down
to
breakfast
my
cousins
had
not
yet
been
summoned
to
their
mama
eliza
was
putting
on
her
bonnet
and
warm
garden
coat
to
go
and
feed
her
poultry
an
occupation
of
which
she
was
fond
and
not
less
so
of
selling
the
eggs
to
the
housekeeper
and
hoarding
up
the
money
she
thus
obtained
she
had
a
turn
for
traffic
and
a
marked
propensity
for
saving
shown
not
only
in
the
vending
of
eggs
and
chickens
but
also
in
driving
hard
bargains
with
the
gardener
about
flower
roots
seeds
and
slips
of
plants
that
functionary
having
orders
from
mrs
reed
to
buy
of
his
young
lady
all
the
products
of
her
parterre
she
wished
to
sell
and
eliza
would
have
sold
the
hair
off
her
head
if
she
could
have
made
a
handsome
profit
thereby
as
to
her
money
she
first
secreted
it
in
odd
corners
wrapped
in
a
rag
or
an
old
curl
paper
but
some
of
these
hoards
having
been
discovered
by
the
housemaid
eliza
fearful
of
one
day
losing
her
valued
treasure
consented
to
intrust
it
to
her
mother
at
a
usurious
rate
of
interest
fifty
or
sixty
per
cent
which
interest
she
exacted
every
quarter
keeping
her
accounts
in
a
little
book
with
anxious
accuracy
georgiana
sat
on
a
high
stool
dressing
her
hair
at
the
glass
and
interweaving
her
curls
with
artificial
flowers
and
faded
feathers
of
which
she
had
found
a
store
in
a
drawer
in
the
attic
i
was
making
my
bed
having
received
strict
orders
from
bessie
to
get
it
arranged
before
she
returned
for
bessie
now
frequently
employed
me
as
a
sort
of
under
nurserymaid
to
tidy
the
room
dust
the
chairs
c
having
spread
the
quilt
and
folded
my
night
dress
i
went
to
the
window
seat
to
put
in
order
some
picture
books
and
doll
s
house
furniture
scattered
there
an
abrupt
command
from
georgiana
to
let
her
playthings
alone
for
the
tiny
chairs
and
mirrors
the
fairy
plates
and
cups
were
her
property
stopped
my
proceedings
and
then
for
lack
of
other
occupation
i
fell
to
breathing
on
the
frost
flowers
with
which
the
window
was
fretted
and
thus
clearing
a
space
in
the
glass
through
which
i
might
look
out
on
the
grounds
where
all
was
still
and
petrified
under
the
influence
of
a
hard
frost
from
this
window
were
visible
the
porter
s
lodge
and
the
carriage
road
and
just
as
i
had
dissolved
so
much
of
the
silver
white
foliage
veiling
the
panes
as
left
room
to
look
out
i
saw
the
gates
thrown
open
and
a
carriage
roll
through
i
watched
it
ascending
the
drive
with
indifference
carriages
often
came
to
gateshead
but
none
ever
brought
visitors
in
whom
i
was
interested
it
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
the
door
bell
rang
loudly
the
new
comer
was
admitted
all
this
being
nothing
to
me
my
vacant
attention
soon
found
livelier
attraction
in
the
spectacle
of
a
little
hungry
robin
which
came
and
chirruped
on
the
twigs
of
the
leafless
cherry
tree
nailed
against
the
wall
near
the
casement
the
remains
of
my
breakfast
of
bread
and
milk
stood
on
the
table
and
having
crumbled
a
morsel
of
roll
i
was
tugging
at
the
sash
to
put
out
the
crumbs
on
the
window
sill
when
bessie
came
running
upstairs
into
the
nursery
miss
jane
take
off
your
pinafore
what
are
you
doing
there
have
you
washed
your
hands
and
face
this
morning
i
gave
another
tug
before
i
answered
for
i
wanted
the
bird
to
be
secure
of
its
bread
the
sash
yielded
i
scattered
the
crumbs
some
on
the
stone
sill
some
on
the
cherry
tree
bough
then
closing
the
window
i
replied
no
bessie
i
have
only
just
finished
dusting
troublesome
careless
child
and
what
are
you
doing
now
you
look
quite
red
as
if
you
had
been
about
some
mischief
what
were
you
opening
the
window
for
i
was
spared
the
trouble
of
answering
for
bessie
seemed
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
listen
to
explanations
she
hauled
me
to
the
washstand
inflicted
a
merciless
but
happily
brief
scrub
on
my
face
and
hands
with
soap
water
and
a
coarse
towel
disciplined
my
head
with
a
bristly
brush
denuded
me
of
my
pinafore
and
then
hurrying
me
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
bid
me
go
down
directly
as
i
was
wanted
in
the
breakfast
room
i
would
have
asked
who
wanted
me
i
would
have
demanded
if
mrs
reed
was
there
but
bessie
was
already
gone
and
had
closed
the
nursery
door
upon
me
i
slowly
descended
for
nearly
three
months
i
had
never
been
called
to
mrs
reed
s
presence
restricted
so
long
to
the
nursery
the
breakfast
dining
and
drawing
rooms
were
become
for
me
awful
regions
on
which
it
dismayed
me
to
intrude
i
now
stood
in
the
empty
hall
before
me
was
the
breakfast
room
door
and
i
stopped
intimidated
and
trembling
what
a
miserable
little
poltroon
had
fear
engendered
of
unjust
punishment
made
of
me
in
those
days
i
feared
to
return
to
the
nursery
and
feared
to
go
forward
to
the
parlour
ten
minutes
i
stood
in
agitated
hesitation
the
vehement
ringing
of
the
breakfast
room
bell
decided
me
i
must
enter
who
could
want
me
i
asked
inwardly
as
with
both
hands
i
turned
the
stiff
door
handle
which
for
a
second
or
two
resisted
my
efforts
what
should
i
see
besides
aunt
reed
in
the
apartment
a
man
or
a
woman
the
handle
turned
the
door
unclosed
and
passing
through
and
curtseying
low
i
looked
up
at
a
black
pillar
such
at
least
appeared
to
me
at
first
sight
the
straight
narrow
sable
clad
shape
standing
erect
on
the
rug
the
grim
face
at
the
top
was
like
a
carved
mask
placed
above
the
shaft
by
way
of
capital
mrs
reed
occupied
her
usual
seat
by
the
fireside
she
made
a
signal
to
me
to
approach
i
did
so
and
she
introduced
me
to
the
stony
stranger
with
the
words
this
is
the
little
girl
respecting
whom
i
applied
to
you
he
for
it
was
a
man
turned
his
head
slowly
towards
where
i
stood
and
having
examined
me
with
the
two
inquisitive
looking
grey
eyes
which
twinkled
under
a
pair
of
bushy
brows
said
solemnly
and
in
a
bass
voice
her
size
is
small
what
is
her
age
ten
years
so
much
was
the
doubtful
answer
and
he
prolonged
his
scrutiny
for
some
minutes
presently
he
addressed
me
your
name
little
girl
jane
eyre
sir
in
uttering
these
words
i
looked
up
he
seemed
to
me
a
tall
gentleman
but
then
i
was
very
little
his
features
were
large
and
they
and
all
the
lines
of
his
frame
were
equally
harsh
and
prim
well
jane
eyre
and
are
you
a
good
child
impossible
to
reply
to
this
in
the
affirmative
my
little
world
held
a
contrary
opinion
i
was
silent
mrs
reed
answered
for
me
by
an
expressive
shake
of
the
head
adding
soon
perhaps
the
less
said
on
that
subject
the
better
mr
brocklehurst
sorry
indeed
to
hear
it
she
and
i
must
have
some
talk
and
bending
from
the
perpendicular
he
installed
his
person
in
the
arm
chair
opposite
mrs
reed
s
come
here
he
said
i
stepped
across
the
rug
he
placed
me
square
and
straight
before
him
what
a
face
he
had
now
that
it
was
almost
on
a
level
with
mine
what
a
great
nose
and
what
a
mouth
and
what
large
prominent
teeth
no
sight
so
sad
as
that
of
a
naughty
child
he
began
especially
a
naughty
little
girl
do
you
know
where
the
wicked
go
after
death
they
go
to
hell
was
my
ready
and
orthodox
answer
and
what
is
hell
can
you
tell
me
that
a
pit
full
of
fire
and
should
you
like
to
fall
into
that
pit
and
to
be
burning
there
for
ever
no
sir
what
must
you
do
to
avoid
it
i
deliberated
a
moment
my
answer
when
it
did
come
was
objectionable
i
must
keep
in
good
health
and
not
die
how
can
you
keep
in
good
health
children
younger
than
you
die
daily
i
buried
a
little
child
of
five
years
old
only
a
day
or
two
since
a
good
little
child
whose
soul
is
now
in
heaven
it
is
to
be
feared
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
you
were
you
to
be
called
hence
not
being
in
a
condition
to
remove
his
doubt
i
only
cast
my
eyes
down
on
the
two
large
feet
planted
on
the
rug
and
sighed
wishing
myself
far
enough
away
i
hope
that
sigh
is
from
the
heart
and
that
you
repent
of
ever
having
been
the
occasion
of
discomfort
to
your
excellent
benefactress
benefactress
benefactress
said
i
inwardly
they
all
call
mrs
reed
my
benefactress
if
so
a
benefactress
is
a
disagreeable
thing
do
you
say
your
prayers
night
and
morning
continued
my
interrogator
yes
sir
do
you
read
your
bible
sometimes
with
pleasure
are
you
fond
of
it
i
like
revelations
and
the
book
of
daniel
and
genesis
and
samuel
and
a
little
bit
of
exodus
and
some
parts
of
kings
and
chronicles
and
job
and
jonah
and
the
psalms
i
hope
you
like
them
no
sir
no
oh
shocking
i
have
a
little
boy
younger
than
you
who
knows
six
psalms
by
heart
and
when
you
ask
him
which
he
would
rather
have
a
gingerbread
nut
to
eat
or
a
verse
of
a
psalm
to
learn
he
says
oh
the
verse
of
a
psalm
angels
sing
psalms
says
he
i
wish
to
be
a
little
angel
here
below
he
then
gets
two
nuts
in
recompense
for
his
infant
piety
psalms
are
not
interesting
i
remarked
that
proves
you
have
a
wicked
heart
and
you
must
pray
to
god
to
change
it
to
give
you
a
new
and
clean
one
to
take
away
your
heart
of
stone
and
give
you
a
heart
of
flesh
i
was
about
to
propound
a
question
touching
the
manner
in
which
that
operation
of
changing
my
heart
was
to
be
performed
when
mrs
reed
interposed
telling
me
to
sit
down
she
then
proceeded
to
carry
on
the
conversation
herself
mr
brocklehurst
i
believe
i
intimated
in
the
letter
which
i
wrote
to
you
three
weeks
ago
that
this
little
girl
has
not
quite
the
character
and
disposition
i
could
wish
should
you
admit
her
into
lowood
school
i
should
be
glad
if
the
superintendent
and
teachers
were
requested
to
keep
a
strict
eye
on
her
and
above
all
to
guard
against
her
worst
fault
a
tendency
to
deceit
i
mention
this
in
your
hearing
jane
that
you
may
not
attempt
to
impose
on
mr
brocklehurst
well
might
i
dread
well
might
i
dislike
mrs
reed
for
it
was
her
nature
to
wound
me
cruelly
never
was
i
happy
in
her
presence
however
carefully
i
obeyed
however
strenuously
i
strove
to
please
her
my
efforts
were
still
repulsed
and
repaid
by
such
sentences
as
the
above
now
uttered
before
a
stranger
the
accusation
cut
me
to
the
heart
i
dimly
perceived
that
she
was
already
obliterating
hope
from
the
new
phase
of
existence
which
she
destined
me
to
enter
i
felt
though
i
could
not
have
expressed
the
feeling
that
she
was
sowing
aversion
and
unkindness
along
my
future
path
i
saw
myself
transformed
under
mr
brocklehurst
s
eye
into
an
artful
noxious
child
and
what
could
i
do
to
remedy
the
injury
nothing
indeed
thought
i
as
i
struggled
to
repress
a
sob
and
hastily
wiped
away
some
tears
the
impotent
evidences
of
my
anguish
deceit
is
indeed
a
sad
fault
in
a
child
said
mr
brocklehurst
it
is
akin
to
falsehood
and
all
liars
will
have
their
portion
in
the
lake
burning
with
fire
and
brimstone
she
shall
however
be
watched
mrs
reed
i
will
speak
to
miss
temple
and
the
teachers
i
should
wish
her
to
be
brought
up
in
a
manner
suiting
her
prospects
continued
my
benefactress
to
be
made
useful
to
be
kept
humble
as
for
the
vacations
she
will
with
your
permission
spend
them
always
at
lowood
your
decisions
are
perfectly
judicious
madam
returned
mr
brocklehurst
humility
is
a
christian
grace
and
one
peculiarly
appropriate
to
the
pupils
of
lowood
i
therefore
direct
that
especial
care
shall
be
bestowed
on
its
cultivation
amongst
them
i
have
studied
how
best
to
mortify
in
them
the
worldly
sentiment
of
pride
and
only
the
other
day
i
had
a
pleasing
proof
of
my
success
my
second
daughter
augusta
went
with
her
mama
to
visit
the
school
and
on
her
return
she
exclaimed
oh
dear
papa
how
quiet
and
plain
all
the
girls
at
lowood
look
with
their
hair
combed
behind
their
ears
and
their
long
pinafores
and
those
little
holland
pockets
outside
their
frocks
they
are
almost
like
poor
people
s
children
and
said
she
they
looked
at
my
dress
and
mama
s
as
if
they
had
never
seen
a
silk
gown
before
this
is
the
state
of
things
i
quite
approve
returned
mrs
reed
had
i
sought
all
england
over
i
could
scarcely
have
found
a
system
more
exactly
fitting
a
child
like
jane
eyre
consistency
my
dear
mr
brocklehurst
i
advocate
consistency
in
all
things
consistency
madam
is
the
first
of
christian
duties
and
it
has
been
observed
in
every
arrangement
connected
with
the
establishment
of
lowood
plain
fare
simple
attire
unsophisticated
accommodations
hardy
and
active
habits
such
is
the
order
of
the
day
in
the
house
and
its
inhabitants
quite
right
sir
i
may
then
depend
upon
this
child
being
received
as
a
pupil
at
lowood
and
there
being
trained
in
conformity
to
her
position
and
prospects
madam
you
may
she
shall
be
placed
in
that
nursery
of
chosen
plants
and
i
trust
she
will
show
herself
grateful
for
the
inestimable
privilege
of
her
election
i
will
send
her
then
as
soon
as
possible
mr
brocklehurst
for
i
assure
you
i
feel
anxious
to
be
relieved
of
a
responsibility
that
was
becoming
too
irksome
no
doubt
no
doubt
madam
and
now
i
wish
you
good
morning
i
shall
return
to
brocklehurst
hall
in
the
course
of
a
week
or
two
my
good
friend
the
archdeacon
will
not
permit
me
to
leave
him
sooner
i
shall
send
miss
temple
notice
that
she
is
to
expect
a
new
girl
so
that
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
receiving
her
good
bye
good
bye
mr
brocklehurst
remember
me
to
mrs
and
miss
brocklehurst
and
to
augusta
and
theodore
and
master
broughton
brocklehurst
i
will
madam
little
girl
here
is
a
book
entitled
the
child
s
guide
read
it
with
prayer
especially
that
part
containing
an
account
of
the
awfully
sudden
death
of
martha
g
a
naughty
child
addicted
to
falsehood
and
deceit
with
these
words
mr
brocklehurst
put
into
my
hand
a
thin
pamphlet
sewn
in
a
cover
and
having
rung
for
his
carriage
he
departed
mrs
reed
and
i
were
left
alone
some
minutes
passed
in
silence
she
was
sewing
i
was
watching
her
mrs
reed
might
be
at
that
time
some
six
or
seven
and
thirty
she
was
a
woman
of
robust
frame
square
shouldered
and
strong
limbed
not
tall
and
though
stout
not
obese
she
had
a
somewhat
large
face
the
under
jaw
being
much
developed
and
very
solid
her
brow
was
low
her
chin
large
and
prominent
mouth
and
nose
sufficiently
regular
under
her
light
eyebrows
glimmered
an
eye
devoid
of
ruth
her
skin
was
dark
and
opaque
her
hair
nearly
flaxen
her
constitution
was
sound
as
a
bell
illness
never
came
near
her
she
was
an
exact
clever
manager
her
household
and
tenantry
were
thoroughly
under
her
control
her
children
only
at
times
defied
her
authority
and
laughed
it
to
scorn
she
dressed
well
and
had
a
presence
and
port
calculated
to
set
off
handsome
attire
sitting
on
a
low
stool
a
few
yards
from
her
arm
chair
i
examined
her
figure
i
perused
her
features
in
my
hand
i
held
the
tract
containing
the
sudden
death
of
the
liar
to
which
narrative
my
attention
had
been
pointed
as
to
an
appropriate
warning
what
had
just
passed
what
mrs
reed
had
said
concerning
me
to
mr
brocklehurst
the
whole
tenor
of
their
conversation
was
recent
raw
and
stinging
in
my
mind
i
had
felt
every
word
as
acutely
as
i
had
heard
it
plainly
and
a
passion
of
resentment
fomented
now
within
me
mrs
reed
looked
up
from
her
work
her
eye
settled
on
mine
her
fingers
at
the
same
time
suspended
their
nimble
movements
go
out
of
the
room
return
to
the
nursery
was
her
mandate
my
look
or
something
else
must
have
struck
her
as
offensive
for
she
spoke
with
extreme
though
suppressed
irritation
i
got
up
i
went
to
the
door
i
came
back
again
i
walked
to
the
window
across
the
room
then
close
up
to
her
speak
i
must
i
had
been
trodden
on
severely
and
must
turn
but
how
what
strength
had
i
to
dart
retaliation
at
my
antagonist
i
gathered
my
energies
and
launched
them
in
this
blunt
sentence
i
am
not
deceitful
if
i
were
i
should
say
i
loved
you
but
i
declare
i
do
not
love
you
i
dislike
you
the
worst
of
anybody
in
the
world
except
john
reed
and
this
book
about
the
liar
you
may
give
to
your
girl
georgiana
for
it
is
she
who
tells
lies
and
not
i
mrs
reed
s
hands
still
lay
on
her
work
inactive
her
eye
of
ice
continued
to
dwell
freezingly
on
mine
what
more
have
you
to
say
she
asked
rather
in
the
tone
in
which
a
person
might
address
an
opponent
of
adult
age
than
such
as
is
ordinarily
used
to
a
child
that
eye
of
hers
that
voice
stirred
every
antipathy
i
had
shaking
from
head
to
foot
thrilled
with
ungovernable
excitement
i
continued
i
am
glad
you
are
no
relation
of
mine
i
will
never
call
you
aunt
again
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
never
come
to
see
you
when
i
am
grown
up
and
if
any
one
asks
me
how
i
liked
you
and
how
you
treated
me
i
will
say
the
very
thought
of
you
makes
me
sick
and
that
you
treated
me
with
miserable
cruelty
how
dare
you
affirm
that
jane
eyre
how
dare
i
mrs
reed
how
dare
i
because
it
is
the
truth
you
think
i
have
no
feelings
and
that
i
can
do
without
one
bit
of
love
or
kindness
but
i
cannot
live
so
and
you
have
no
pity
i
shall
remember
how
you
thrust
me
back
roughly
and
violently
thrust
me
back
into
the
red
room
and
locked
me
up
there
to
my
dying
day
though
i
was
in
agony
though
i
cried
out
while
suffocating
with
distress
have
mercy
have
mercy
aunt
reed
and
that
punishment
you
made
me
suffer
because
your
wicked
boy
struck
me
knocked
me
down
for
nothing
i
will
tell
anybody
who
asks
me
questions
this
exact
tale
people
think
you
a
good
woman
but
you
are
bad
hard
hearted
you
are
deceitful
how
dare
i
mrs
ried
how
dare
i
because
it
is
the
truth

ere
i
had
finished
this
reply
my
soul
began
to
expand
to
exult
with
the
strangest
sense
of
freedom
of
triumph
i
ever
felt
it
seemed
as
if
an
invisible
bond
had
burst
and
that
i
had
struggled
out
into
unhoped
for
liberty
not
without
cause
was
this
sentiment
mrs
reed
looked
frightened
her
work
had
slipped
from
her
knee
she
was
lifting
up
her
hands
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
even
twisting
her
face
as
if
she
would
cry
jane
you
are
under
a
mistake
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
do
you
tremble
so
violently
would
you
like
to
drink
some
water
no
mrs
reed
is
there
anything
else
you
wish
for
jane
i
assure
you
i
desire
to
be
your
friend
not
you
you
told
mr
brocklehurst
i
had
a
bad
character
a
deceitful
disposition
and
i
ll
let
everybody
at
lowood
know
what
you
are
and
what
you
have
done
jane
you
don
t
understand
these
things
children
must
be
corrected
for
their
faults
deceit
is
not
my
fault
i
cried
out
in
a
savage
high
voice
but
you
are
passionate
jane
that
you
must
allow
and
now
return
to
the
nursery
there
s
a
dear
and
lie
down
a
little
i
am
not
your
dear
i
cannot
lie
down
send
me
to
school
soon
mrs
reed
for
i
hate
to
live
here
i
will
indeed
send
her
to
school
soon
murmured
mrs
reed
sotto
voce
and
gathering
up
her
work
she
abruptly
quitted
the
apartment
i
was
left
there
alone
winner
of
the
field
it
was
the
hardest
battle
i
had
fought
and
the
first
victory
i
had
gained
i
stood
awhile
on
the
rug
where
mr
brocklehurst
had
stood
and
i
enjoyed
my
conqueror
s
solitude
first
i
smiled
to
myself
and
felt
elate
but
this
fierce
pleasure
subsided
in
me
as
fast
as
did
the
accelerated
throb
of
my
pulses
a
child
cannot
quarrel
with
its
elders
as
i
had
done
cannot
give
its
furious
feelings
uncontrolled
play
as
i
had
given
mine
without
experiencing
afterwards
the
pang
of
remorse
and
the
chill
of
reaction
a
ridge
of
lighted
heath
alive
glancing
devouring
would
have
been
a
meet
emblem
of
my
mind
when
i
accused
and
menaced
mrs
reed
the
same
ridge
black
and
blasted
after
the
flames
are
dead
would
have
represented
as
meetly
my
subsequent
condition
when
half
an
hour
s
silence
and
reflection
had
shown
me
the
madness
of
my
conduct
and
the
dreariness
of
my
hated
and
hating
position
something
of
vengeance
i
had
tasted
for
the
first
time
as
aromatic
wine
it
seemed
on
swallowing
warm
and
racy
its
after
flavour
metallic
and
corroding
gave
me
a
sensation
as
if
i
had
been
poisoned
willingly
would
i
now
have
gone
and
asked
mrs
reed
s
pardon
but
i
knew
partly
from
experience
and
partly
from
instinct
that
was
the
way
to
make
her
repulse
me
with
double
scorn
thereby
re
exciting
every
turbulent
impulse
of
my
nature
i
would
fain
exercise
some
better
faculty
than
that
of
fierce
speaking
fain
find
nourishment
for
some
less
fiendish
feeling
than
that
of
sombre
indignation
i
took
a
book
some
arabian
tales
i
sat
down
and
endeavoured
to
read
i
could
make
no
sense
of
the
subject
my
own
thoughts
swam
always
between
me
and
the
page
i
had
usually
found
fascinating
i
opened
the
glass
door
in
the
breakfast
room
the
shrubbery
was
quite
still
the
black
frost
reigned
unbroken
by
sun
or
breeze
through
the
grounds
i
covered
my
head
and
arms
with
the
skirt
of
my
frock
and
went
out
to
walk
in
a
part
of
the
plantation
which
was
quite
sequestrated
but
i
found
no
pleasure
in
the
silent
trees
the
falling
fir
cones
the
congealed
relics
of
autumn
russet
leaves
swept
by
past
winds
in
heaps
and
now
stiffened
together
i
leaned
against
a
gate
and
looked
into
an
empty
field
where
no
sheep
were
feeding
where
the
short
grass
was
nipped
and
blanched
it
was
a
very
grey
day
a
most
opaque
sky
onding
on
snaw
canopied
all
thence
flakes
felt
it
intervals
which
settled
on
the
hard
path
and
on
the
hoary
lea
without
melting
i
stood
a
wretched
child
enough
whispering
to
myself
over
and
over
again
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
all
at
once
i
heard
a
clear
voice
call
miss
jane
where
are
you
come
to
lunch
it
was
bessie
i
knew
well
enough
but
i
did
not
stir
her
light
step
came
tripping
down
the
path
you
naughty
little
thing
she
said
why
don
t
you
come
when
you
are
called
bessie
s
presence
compared
with
the
thoughts
over
which
i
had
been
brooding
seemed
cheerful
even
though
as
usual
she
was
somewhat
cross
the
fact
is
after
my
conflict
with
and
victory
over
mrs
reed
i
was
not
disposed
to
care
much
for
the
nursemaid
s
transitory
anger
and
i
was
disposed
to
bask
in
her
youthful
lightness
of
heart
i
just
put
my
two
arms
round
her
and
said
come
bessie
don
t
scold
the
action
was
more
frank
and
fearless
than
any
i
was
habituated
to
indulge
in
somehow
it
pleased
her
you
are
a
strange
child
miss
jane
she
said
as
she
looked
down
at
me
a
little
roving
solitary
thing
and
you
are
going
to
school
i
suppose
i
nodded
and
won
t
you
be
sorry
to
leave
poor
bessie
what
does
bessie
care
for
me
she
is
always
scolding
me
because
you
re
such
a
queer
frightened
shy
little
thing
you
should
be
bolder
what
to
get
more
knocks
nonsense
but
you
are
rather
put
upon
that
s
certain
my
mother
said
when
she
came
to
see
me
last
week
that
she
would
not
like
a
little
one
of
her
own
to
be
in
your
place
now
come
in
and
i
ve
some
good
news
for
you
i
don
t
think
you
have
bessie
child
what
do
you
mean
what
sorrowful
eyes
you
fix
on
me
well
but
missis
and
the
young
ladies
and
master
john
are
going
out
to
tea
this
afternoon
and
you
shall
have
tea
with
me
i
ll
ask
cook
to
bake
you
a
little
cake
and
then
you
shall
help
me
to
look
over
your
drawers
for
i
am
soon
to
pack
your
trunk
missis
intends
you
to
leave
gateshead
in
a
day
or
two
and
you
shall
choose
what
toys
you
like
to
take
with
you
bessie
you
must
promise
not
to
scold
me
any
more
till
i
go
well
i
will
but
mind
you
are
a
very
good
girl
and
don
t
be
afraid
of
me
don
t
start
when
i
chance
to
speak
rather
sharply
it
s
so
provoking
i
don
t
think
i
shall
ever
be
afraid
of
you
again
bessie
because
i
have
got
used
to
you
and
i
shall
soon
have
another
set
of
people
to
dread
if
you
dread
them
they
ll
dislike
you
as
you
do
bessie
i
don
t
dislike
you
miss
i
believe
i
am
fonder
of
you
than
of
all
the
others
you
don
t
show
it
you
little
sharp
thing
you
ve
got
quite
a
new
way
of
talking
what
makes
you
so
venturesome
and
hardy
why
i
shall
soon
be
away
from
you
and
besides
i
was
going
to
say
something
about
what
had
passed
between
me
and
mrs
reed
but
on
second
thoughts
i
considered
it
better
to
remain
silent
on
that
head
and
so
you
re
glad
to
leave
me
not
at
all
bessie
indeed
just
now
i
m
rather
sorry
just
now
and
rather
how
coolly
my
little
lady
says
it
i
dare
say
now
if
i
were
to
ask
you
for
a
kiss
you
wouldn
t
give
it
me
you
d
say
you
d
rather
not
i
ll
kiss
you
and
welcome
bend
your
head
down
bessie
stooped
we
mutually
embraced
and
i
followed
her
into
the
house
quite
comforted
that
afternoon
lapsed
in
peace
and
harmony
and
in
the
evening
bessie
told
me
some
of
her
most
enchanting
stories
and
sang
me
some
of
her
sweetest
songs
even
for
me
life
had
its
gleams
of
sunshine
chapter
v
five
o
clock
had
hardly
struck
on
the
morning
of
the
19th
of
january
when
bessie
brought
a
candle
into
my
closet
and
found
me
already
up
and
nearly
dressed
i
had
risen
half
an
hour
before
her
entrance
and
had
washed
my
face
and
put
on
my
clothes
by
the
light
of
a
half
moon
just
setting
whose
rays
streamed
through
the
narrow
window
near
my
crib
i
was
to
leave
gateshead
that
day
by
a
coach
which
passed
the
lodge
gates
at
six
a
m
bessie
was
the
only
person
yet
risen
she
had
lit
a
fire
in
the
nursery
where
she
now
proceeded
to
make
my
breakfast
few
children
can
eat
when
excited
with
the
thoughts
of
a
journey
nor
could
i
bessie
having
pressed
me
in
vain
to
take
a
few
spoonfuls
of
the
boiled
milk
and
bread
she
had
prepared
for
me
wrapped
up
some
biscuits
in
a
paper
and
put
them
into
my
bag
then
she
helped
me
on
with
my
pelisse
and
bonnet
and
wrapping
herself
in
a
shawl
she
and
i
left
the
nursery
as
we
passed
mrs
reed
s
bedroom
she
said
will
you
go
in
and
bid
missis
good
bye
no
bessie
she
came
to
my
crib
last
night
when
you
were
gone
down
to
supper
and
said
i
need
not
disturb
her
in
the
morning
or
my
cousins
either
and
she
told
me
to
remember
that
she
had
always
been
my
best
friend
and
to
speak
of
her
and
be
grateful
to
her
accordingly
what
did
you
say
miss
nothing
i
covered
my
face
with
the
bedclothes
and
turned
from
her
to
the
wall
that
was
wrong
miss
jane
it
was
quite
right
bessie
your
missis
has
not
been
my
friend
she
has
been
my
foe
o
miss
jane
don
t
say
so
good
bye
to
gateshead
cried
i
as
we
passed
through
the
hall
and
went
out
at
the
front
door
the
moon
was
set
and
it
was
very
dark
bessie
carried
a
lantern
whose
light
glanced
on
wet
steps
and
gravel
road
sodden
by
a
recent
thaw
raw
and
chill
was
the
winter
morning
my
teeth
chattered
as
i
hastened
down
the
drive
there
was
a
light
in
the
porter
s
lodge
when
we
reached
it
we
found
the
porter
s
wife
just
kindling
her
fire
my
trunk
which
had
been
carried
down
the
evening
before
stood
corded
at
the
door
it
wanted
but
a
few
minutes
of
six
and
shortly
after
that
hour
had
struck
the
distant
roll
of
wheels
announced
the
coming
coach
i
went
to
the
door
and
watched
its
lamps
approach
rapidly
through
the
gloom
is
she
going
by
herself
asked
the
porter
s
wife
yes
and
how
far
is
it
fifty
miles
what
a
long
way
i
wonder
mrs
reed
is
not
afraid
to
trust
her
so
far
alone
the
coach
drew
up
there
it
was
at
the
gates
with
its
four
horses
and
its
top
laden
with
passengers
the
guard
and
coachman
loudly
urged
haste
my
trunk
was
hoisted
up
i
was
taken
from
bessie
s
neck
to
which
i
clung
with
kisses
be
sure
and
take
good
care
of
her
cried
she
to
the
guard
as
he
lifted
me
into
the
inside
ay
ay
was
the
answer
the
door
was
slapped
to
a
voice
exclaimed
all
right
and
on
we
drove
thus
was
i
severed
from
bessie
and
gateshead
thus
whirled
away
to
unknown
and
as
i
then
deemed
remote
and
mysterious
regions
i
remember
but
little
of
the
journey
i
only
know
that
the
day
seemed
to
me
of
a
preternatural
length
and
that
we
appeared
to
travel
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
road
we
passed
through
several
towns
and
in
one
a
very
large
one
the
coach
stopped
the
horses
were
taken
out
and
the
passengers
alighted
to
dine
i
was
carried
into
an
inn
where
the
guard
wanted
me
to
have
some
dinner
but
as
i
had
no
appetite
he
left
me
in
an
immense
room
with
a
fireplace
at
each
end
a
chandelier
pendent
from
the
ceiling
and
a
little
red
gallery
high
up
against
the
wall
filled
with
musical
instruments
here
i
walked
about
for
a
long
time
feeling
very
strange
and
mortally
apprehensive
of
some
one
coming
in
and
kidnapping
me
for
i
believed
in
kidnappers
their
exploits
having
frequently
figured
in
bessie
s
fireside
chronicles
at
last
the
guard
returned
once
more
i
was
stowed
away
in
the
coach
my
protector
mounted
his
own
seat
sounded
his
hollow
horn
and
away
we
rattled
over
the
stony
street
of
l
the
afternoon
came
on
wet
and
somewhat
misty
as
it
waned
into
dusk
i
began
to
feel
that
we
were
getting
very
far
indeed
from
gateshead
we
ceased
to
pass
through
towns
the
country
changed
great
grey
hills
heaved
up
round
the
horizon
as
twilight
deepened
we
descended
a
valley
dark
with
wood
and
long
after
night
had
overclouded
the
prospect
i
heard
a
wild
wind
rushing
amongst
trees
lulled
by
the
sound
i
at
last
dropped
asleep
i
had
not
long
slumbered
when
the
sudden
cessation
of
motion
awoke
me
the
coach
door
was
open
and
a
person
like
a
servant
was
standing
at
it
i
saw
her
face
and
dress
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
is
there
a
little
girl
called
jane
eyre
here
she
asked
i
answered
yes
and
was
then
lifted
out
my
trunk
was
handed
down
and
the
coach
instantly
drove
away
i
was
stiff
with
long
sitting
and
bewildered
with
the
noise
and
motion
of
the
coach
gathering
my
faculties
i
looked
about
me
rain
wind
and
darkness
filled
the
air
nevertheless
i
dimly
discerned
a
wall
before
me
and
a
door
open
in
it
through
this
door
i
passed
with
my
new
guide
she
shut
and
locked
it
behind
her
there
was
now
visible
a
house
or
houses
for
the
building
spread
far
with
many
windows
and
lights
burning
in
some
we
went
up
a
broad
pebbly
path
splashing
wet
and
were
admitted
at
a
door
then
the
servant
led
me
through
a
passage
into
a
room
with
a
fire
where
she
left
me
alone
i
stood
and
warmed
my
numbed
fingers
over
the
blaze
then
i
looked
round
there
was
no
candle
but
the
uncertain
light
from
the
hearth
showed
by
intervals
papered
walls
carpet
curtains
shining
mahogany
furniture
it
was
a
parlour
not
so
spacious
or
splendid
as
the
drawing
room
at
gateshead
but
comfortable
enough
i
was
puzzling
to
make
out
the
subject
of
a
picture
on
the
wall
when
the
door
opened
and
an
individual
carrying
a
light
entered
another
followed
close
behind
the
first
was
a
tall
lady
with
dark
hair
dark
eyes
and
a
pale
and
large
forehead
her
figure
was
partly
enveloped
in
a
shawl
her
countenance
was
grave
her
bearing
erect
the
child
is
very
young
to
be
sent
alone
said
she
putting
her
candle
down
on
the
table
she
considered
me
attentively
for
a
minute
or
two
then
further
added
she
had
better
be
put
to
bed
soon
she
looks
tired
are
you
tired
she
asked
placing
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
a
little
ma
am
and
hungry
too
no
doubt
let
her
have
some
supper
before
she
goes
to
bed
miss
miller
is
this
the
first
time
you
have
left
your
parents
to
come
to
school
my
little
girl
i
explained
to
her
that
i
had
no
parents
she
inquired
how
long
they
had
been
dead
then
how
old
i
was
what
was
my
name
whether
i
could
read
write
and
sew
a
little
then
she
touched
my
cheek
gently
with
her
forefinger
and
saying
she
hoped
i
should
be
a
good
child
dismissed
me
along
with
miss
miller
the
lady
i
had
left
might
be
about
twenty
nine
the
one
who
went
with
me
appeared
some
years
younger
the
first
impressed
me
by
her
voice
look
and
air
miss
miller
was
more
ordinary
ruddy
in
complexion
though
of
a
careworn
countenance
hurried
in
gait
and
action
like
one
who
had
always
a
multiplicity
of
tasks
on
hand
she
looked
indeed
what
i
afterwards
found
she
really
was
an
under
teacher
led
by
her
i
passed
from
compartment
to
compartment
from
passage
to
passage
of
a
large
and
irregular
building
till
emerging
from
the
total
and
somewhat
dreary
silence
pervading
that
portion
of
the
house
we
had
traversed
we
came
upon
the
hum
of
many
voices
and
presently
entered
a
wide
long
room
with
great
deal
tables
two
at
each
end
on
each
of
which
burnt
a
pair
of
candles
and
seated
all
round
on
benches
a
congregation
of
girls
of
every
age
from
nine
or
ten
to
twenty
seen
by
the
dim
light
of
the
dips
their
number
to
me
appeared
countless
though
not
in
reality
exceeding
eighty
they
were
uniformly
dressed
in
brown
stuff
frocks
of
quaint
fashion
and
long
holland
pinafores
it
was
the
hour
of
study
they
were
engaged
in
conning
over
their
to
morrow
s
task
and
the
hum
i
had
heard
was
the
combined
result
of
their
whispered
repetitions
miss
miller
signed
to
me
to
sit
on
a
bench
near
the
door
then
walking
up
to
the
top
of
the
long
room
she
cried
out
monitors
collect
the
lesson
books
and
put
them
away
four
tall
girls
arose
from
different
tables
and
going
round
gathered
the
books
and
removed
them
miss
miller
again
gave
the
word
of
command
monitors
fetch
the
supper
trays
the
tall
girls
went
out
and
returned
presently
each
bearing
a
tray
with
portions
of
something
i
knew
not
what
arranged
thereon
and
a
pitcher
of
water
and
mug
in
the
middle
of
each
tray
the
portions
were
handed
round
those
who
liked
took
a
draught
of
the
water
the
mug
being
common
to
all
when
it
came
to
my
turn
i
drank
for
i
was
thirsty
but
did
not
touch
the
food
excitement
and
fatigue
rendering
me
incapable
of
eating
i
now
saw
however
that
it
was
a
thin
oaten
cake
shared
into
fragments
the
meal
over
prayers
were
read
by
miss
miller
and
the
classes
filed
off
two
and
two
upstairs
overpowered
by
this
time
with
weariness
i
scarcely
noticed
what
sort
of
a
place
the
bedroom
was
except
that
like
the
schoolroom
i
saw
it
was
very
long
to
night
i
was
to
be
miss
miller
s
bed
fellow
she
helped
me
to
undress
when
laid
down
i
glanced
at
the
long
rows
of
beds
each
of
which
was
quickly
filled
with
two
occupants
in
ten
minutes
the
single
light
was
extinguished
and
amidst
silence
and
complete
darkness
i
fell
asleep
the
night
passed
rapidly
i
was
too
tired
even
to
dream
i
only
once
awoke
to
hear
the
wind
rave
in
furious
gusts
and
the
rain
fall
in
torrents
and
to
be
sensible
that
miss
miller
had
taken
her
place
by
my
side
when
i
again
unclosed
my
eyes
a
loud
bell
was
ringing
the
girls
were
up
and
dressing
day
had
not
yet
begun
to
dawn
and
a
rushlight
or
two
burned
in
the
room
i
too
rose
reluctantly
it
was
bitter
cold
and
i
dressed
as
well
as
i
could
for
shivering
and
washed
when
there
was
a
basin
at
liberty
which
did
not
occur
soon
as
there
was
but
one
basin
to
six
girls
on
the
stands
down
the
middle
of
the
room
again
the
bell
rang
all
formed
in
file
two
and
two
and
in
that
order
descended
the
stairs
and
entered
the
cold
and
dimly
lit
schoolroom
here
prayers
were
read
by
miss
miller
afterwards
she
called
out
form
classes
a
great
tumult
succeeded
for
some
minutes
during
which
miss
miller
repeatedly
exclaimed
silence
and
order
when
it
subsided
i
saw
them
all
drawn
up
in
four
semicircles
before
four
chairs
placed
at
the
four
tables
all
held
books
in
their
hands
and
a
great
book
like
a
bible
lay
on
each
table
before
the
vacant
seat
a
pause
of
some
seconds
succeeded
filled
up
by
the
low
vague
hum
of
numbers
miss
miller
walked
from
class
to
class
hushing
this
indefinite
sound
a
distant
bell
tinkled
immediately
three
ladies
entered
the
room
each
walked
to
a
table
and
took
her
seat
miss
miller
assumed
the
fourth
vacant
chair
which
was
that
nearest
the
door
and
around
which
the
smallest
of
the
children
were
assembled
to
this
inferior
class
i
was
called
and
placed
at
the
bottom
of
it
business
now
began
the
day
s
collect
was
repeated
then
certain
texts
of
scripture
were
said
and
to
these
succeeded
a
protracted
reading
of
chapters
in
the
bible
which
lasted
an
hour
by
the
time
that
exercise
was
terminated
day
had
fully
dawned
the
indefatigable
bell
now
sounded
for
the
fourth
time
the
classes
were
marshalled
and
marched
into
another
room
to
breakfast
how
glad
i
was
to
behold
a
prospect
of
getting
something
to
eat
i
was
now
nearly
sick
from
inanition
having
taken
so
little
the
day
before
the
refectory
was
a
great
low
ceiled
gloomy
room
on
two
long
tables
smoked
basins
of
something
hot
which
however
to
my
dismay
sent
forth
an
odour
far
from
inviting
i
saw
a
universal
manifestation
of
discontent
when
the
fumes
of
the
repast
met
the
nostrils
of
those
destined
to
swallow
it
from
the
van
of
the
procession
the
tall
girls
of
the
first
class
rose
the
whispered
words
disgusting
the
porridge
is
burnt
again
silence
ejaculated
a
voice
not
that
of
miss
miller
but
one
of
the
upper
teachers
a
little
and
dark
personage
smartly
dressed
but
of
somewhat
morose
aspect
who
installed
herself
at
the
top
of
one
table
while
a
more
buxom
lady
presided
at
the
other
i
looked
in
vain
for
her
i
had
first
seen
the
night
before
she
was
not
visible
miss
miller
occupied
the
foot
of
the
table
where
i
sat
and
a
strange
foreign
looking
elderly
lady
the
french
teacher
as
i
afterwards
found
took
the
corresponding
seat
at
the
other
board
a
long
grace
was
said
and
a
hymn
sung
then
a
servant
brought
in
some
tea
for
the
teachers
and
the
meal
began
ravenous
and
now
very
faint
i
devoured
a
spoonful
or
two
of
my
portion
without
thinking
of
its
taste
but
the
first
edge
of
hunger
blunted
i
perceived
i
had
got
in
hand
a
nauseous
mess
burnt
porridge
is
almost
as
bad
as
rotten
potatoes
famine
itself
soon
sickens
over
it
the
spoons
were
moved
slowly
i
saw
each
girl
taste
her
food
and
try
to
swallow
it
but
in
most
cases
the
effort
was
soon
relinquished
breakfast
was
over
and
none
had
breakfasted
thanks
being
returned
for
what
we
had
not
got
and
a
second
hymn
chanted
the
refectory
was
evacuated
for
the
schoolroom
i
was
one
of
the
last
to
go
out
and
in
passing
the
tables
i
saw
one
teacher
take
a
basin
of
the
porridge
and
taste
it
she
looked
at
the
others
all
their
countenances
expressed
displeasure
and
one
of
them
the
stout
one
whispered
abominable
stuff
how
shameful
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
before
lessons
again
began
during
which
the
schoolroom
was
in
a
glorious
tumult
for
that
space
of
time
it
seemed
to
be
permitted
to
talk
loud
and
more
freely
and
they
used
their
privilege
the
whole
conversation
ran
on
the
breakfast
which
one
and
all
abused
roundly
poor
things
it
was
the
sole
consolation
they
had
miss
miller
was
now
the
only
teacher
in
the
room
a
group
of
great
girls
standing
about
her
spoke
with
serious
and
sullen
gestures
i
heard
the
name
of
mr
brocklehurst
pronounced
by
some
lips
at
which
miss
miller
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
but
she
made
no
great
effort
to
check
the
general
wrath
doubtless
she
shared
in
it
a
clock
in
the
schoolroom
struck
nine
miss
miller
left
her
circle
and
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
cried
silence
to
your
seats
discipline
prevailed
in
five
minutes
the
confused
throng
was
resolved
into
order
and
comparative
silence
quelled
the
babel
clamour
of
tongues
the
upper
teachers
now
punctually
resumed
their
posts
but
still
all
seemed
to
wait
ranged
on
benches
down
the
sides
of
the
room
the
eighty
girls
sat
motionless
and
erect
a
quaint
assemblage
they
appeared
all
with
plain
locks
combed
from
their
faces
not
a
curl
visible
in
brown
dresses
made
high
and
surrounded
by
a
narrow
tucker
about
the
throat
with
little
pockets
of
holland
shaped
something
like
a
highlander
s
purse
tied
in
front
of
their
frocks
and
destined
to
serve
the
purpose
of
a
work
bag
all
too
wearing
woollen
stockings
and
country
made
shoes
fastened
with
brass
buckles
above
twenty
of
those
clad
in
this
costume
were
full
grown
girls
or
rather
young
women
it
suited
them
ill
and
gave
an
air
of
oddity
even
to
the
prettiest
i
was
still
looking
at
them
and
also
at
intervals
examining
the
teachers
none
of
whom
precisely
pleased
me
for
the
stout
one
was
a
little
coarse
the
dark
one
not
a
little
fierce
the
foreigner
harsh
and
grotesque
and
miss
miller
poor
thing
looked
purple
weather
beaten
and
over
worked
when
as
my
eye
wandered
from
face
to
face
the
whole
school
rose
simultaneously
as
if
moved
by
a
common
spring
what
was
the
matter
i
had
heard
no
order
given
i
was
puzzled
ere
i
had
gathered
my
wits
the
classes
were
again
seated
but
as
all
eyes
were
now
turned
to
one
point
mine
followed
the
general
direction
and
encountered
the
personage
who
had
received
me
last
night
she
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
room
on
the
hearth
for
there
was
a
fire
at
each
end
she
surveyed
the
two
rows
of
girls
silently
and
gravely
miss
miller
approaching
seemed
to
ask
her
a
question
and
having
received
her
answer
went
back
to
her
place
and
said
aloud
monitor
of
the
first
class
fetch
the
globes
while
the
direction
was
being
executed
the
lady
consulted
moved
slowly
up
the
room
i
suppose
i
have
a
considerable
organ
of
veneration
for
i
retain
yet
the
sense
of
admiring
awe
with
which
my
eyes
traced
her
steps
seen
now
in
broad
daylight
she
looked
tall
fair
and
shapely
brown
eyes
with
a
benignant
light
in
their
irids
and
a
fine
pencilling
of
long
lashes
round
relieved
the
whiteness
of
her
large
front
on
each
of
her
temples
her
hair
of
a
very
dark
brown
was
clustered
in
round
curls
according
to
the
fashion
of
those
times
when
neither
smooth
bands
nor
long
ringlets
were
in
vogue
her
dress
also
in
the
mode
of
the
day
was
of
purple
cloth
relieved
by
a
sort
of
spanish
trimming
of
black
velvet
a
gold
watch
watches
were
not
so
common
then
as
now
shone
at
her
girdle
let
the
reader
add
to
complete
the
picture
refined
features
a
complexion
if
pale
clear
and
a
stately
air
and
carriage
and
he
will
have
at
least
as
clearly
as
words
can
give
it
a
correct
idea
of
the
exterior
of
miss
temple
maria
temple
as
i
afterwards
saw
the
name
written
in
a
prayer
book
intrusted
to
me
to
carry
to
church
the
superintendent
of
lowood
for
such
was
this
lady
having
taken
her
seat
before
a
pair
of
globes
placed
on
one
of
the
tables
summoned
the
first
class
round
her
and
commenced
giving
a
lesson
on
geography
the
lower
classes
were
called
by
the
teachers
repetitions
in
history
grammar
c
went
on
for
an
hour
writing
and
arithmetic
succeeded
and
music
lessons
were
given
by
miss
temple
to
some
of
the
elder
girls
the
duration
of
each
lesson
was
measured
by
the
clock
which
at
last
struck
twelve
the
superintendent
rose
i
have
a
word
to
address
to
the
pupils
said
she
the
tumult
of
cessation
from
lessons
was
already
breaking
forth
but
it
sank
at
her
voice
she
went
on
you
had
this
morning
a
breakfast
which
you
could
not
eat
you
must
be
hungry
i
have
ordered
that
a
lunch
of
bread
and
cheese
shall
be
served
to
all
the
teachers
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
surprise
it
is
to
be
done
on
my
responsibility
she
added
in
an
explanatory
tone
to
them
and
immediately
afterwards
left
the
room
the
bread
and
cheese
was
presently
brought
in
and
distributed
to
the
high
delight
and
refreshment
of
the
whole
school
the
order
was
now
given
to
the
garden
each
put
on
a
coarse
straw
bonnet
with
strings
of
coloured
calico
and
a
cloak
of
grey
frieze
i
was
similarly
equipped
and
following
the
stream
i
made
my
way
into
the
open
air
the
garden
was
a
wide
inclosure
surrounded
with
walls
so
high
as
to
exclude
every
glimpse
of
prospect
a
covered
verandah
ran
down
one
side
and
broad
walks
bordered
a
middle
space
divided
into
scores
of
little
beds
these
beds
were
assigned
as
gardens
for
the
pupils
to
cultivate
and
each
bed
had
an
owner
when
full
of
flowers
they
would
doubtless
look
pretty
but
now
at
the
latter
end
of
january
all
was
wintry
blight
and
brown
decay
i
shuddered
as
i
stood
and
looked
round
me
it
was
an
inclement
day
for
outdoor
exercise
not
positively
rainy
but
darkened
by
a
drizzling
yellow
fog
all
under
foot
was
still
soaking
wet
with
the
floods
of
yesterday
the
stronger
among
the
girls
ran
about
and
engaged
in
active
games
but
sundry
pale
and
thin
ones
herded
together
for
shelter
and
warmth
in
the
verandah
and
amongst
these
as
the
dense
mist
penetrated
to
their
shivering
frames
i
heard
frequently
the
sound
of
a
hollow
cough
as
yet
i
had
spoken
to
no
one
nor
did
anybody
seem
to
take
notice
of
me
i
stood
lonely
enough
but
to
that
feeling
of
isolation
i
was
accustomed
it
did
not
oppress
me
much
i
leant
against
a
pillar
of
the
verandah
drew
my
grey
mantle
close
about
me
and
trying
to
forget
the
cold
which
nipped
me
without
and
the
unsatisfied
hunger
which
gnawed
me
within
delivered
myself
up
to
the
employment
of
watching
and
thinking
my
reflections
were
too
undefined
and
fragmentary
to
merit
record
i
hardly
yet
knew
where
i
was
gateshead
and
my
past
life
seemed
floated
away
to
an
immeasurable
distance
the
present
was
vague
and
strange
and
of
the
future
i
could
form
no
conjecture
i
looked
round
the
convent
like
garden
and
then
up
at
the
house
a
large
building
half
of
which
seemed
grey
and
old
the
other
half
quite
new
the
new
part
containing
the
schoolroom
and
dormitory
was
lit
by
mullioned
and
latticed
windows
which
gave
it
a
church
like
aspect
a
stone
tablet
over
the
door
bore
this
inscription

let

your
good

i
read
these
words
over
and
over
again
i
felt
that
an
explanation
belonged
to
them
and
was
unable
fully
to
penetrate
their
import
i
was
still
pondering
the
signification
of
institution
and
endeavouring
to
make
out
a
connection
between
the
first
words
and
the
verse
of
scripture
when
the
sound
of
a
cough
close
behind
me
made
me
turn
my
head
i
saw
a
girl
sitting
on
a
stone
bench
near
she
was
bent
over
a
book
on
the
perusal
of
which
she
seemed
intent
from
where
i
stood
i
could
see
the
title
it
was
rasselas
a
name
that
struck
me
as
strange
and
consequently
attractive
in
turning
a
leaf
she
happened
to
look
up
and
i
said
to
her
directly
is
your
book
interesting
i
had
already
formed
the
intention
of
asking
her
to
lend
it
to
me
some
day
i
like
it
she
answered
after
a
pause
of
a
second
or
two
during
which
she
examined
me
what
is
it
about
i
continued
i
hardly
know
where
i
found
the
hardihood
thus
to
open
a
conversation
with
a
stranger
the
step
was
contrary
to
my
nature
and
habits
but
i
think
her
occupation
touched
a
chord
of
sympathy
somewhere
for
i
too
liked
reading
though
of
a
frivolous
and
childish
kind
i
could
not
digest
or
comprehend
the
serious
or
substantial
you
may
look
at
it
replied
the
girl
offering
me
the
book
i
did
so
a
brief
examination
convinced
me
that
the
contents
were
less
taking
than
the
title
rasselas
looked
dull
to
my
trifling
taste
i
saw
nothing
about
fairies
nothing
about
genii
no
bright
variety
seemed
spread
over
the
closely
printed
pages
i
returned
it
to
her
she
received
it
quietly
and
without
saying
anything
she
was
about
to
relapse
into
her
former
studious
mood
again
i
ventured
to
disturb
her
can
you
tell
me
what
the
writing
on
that
stone
over
the
door
means
what
is
lowood
institution
this
house
where
you
are
come
to
live
and
why
do
they
call
it
institution
is
it
in
any
way
different
from
other
schools
it
is
partly
a
charity
school
you
and
i
and
all
the
rest
of
us
are
charity
children
i
suppose
you
are
an
orphan
are
not
either
your
father
or
your
mother
dead
both
died
before
i
can
remember
well
all
the
girls
here
have
lost
either
one
or
both
parents
and
this
is
called
an
institution
for
educating
orphans
do
we
pay
no
money
do
they
keep
us
for
nothing
we
pay
or
our
friends
pay
fifteen
pounds
a
year
for
each
then
why
do
they
call
us
charity
children
because
fifteen
pounds
is
not
enough
for
board
and
teaching
and
the
deficiency
is
supplied
by
subscription
who
subscribes
different
benevolent
minded
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
this
neighbourhood
and
in
london
who
was
naomi
brocklehurst
the
lady
who
built
the
new
part
of
this
house
as
that
tablet
records
and
whose
son
overlooks
and
directs
everything
here
why
because
he
is
treasurer
and
manager
of
the
establishment
then
this
house
does
not
belong
to
that
tall
lady
who
wears
a
watch
and
who
said
we
were
to
have
some
bread
and
cheese
to
miss
temple
oh
no
i
wish
it
did
she
has
to
answer
to
mr
brocklehurst
for
all
she
does
mr
brocklehurst
buys
all
our
food
and
all
our
clothes
does
he
live
here
no
two
miles
off
at
a
large
hall
is
he
a
good
man
he
is
a
clergyman
and
is
said
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
did
you
say
that
tall
lady
was
called
miss
temple
yes
and
what
are
the
other
teachers
called
the
one
with
red
cheeks
is
called
miss
smith
she
attends
to
the
work
and
cuts
out
for
we
make
our
own
clothes
our
frocks
and
pelisses
and
everything
the
little
one
with
black
hair
is
miss
scatcherd
she
teaches
history
and
grammar
and
hears
the
second
class
repetitions
and
the
one
who
wears
a
shawl
and
has
a
pocket
handkerchief
tied
to
her
side
with
a
yellow
ribband
is
madame
pierrot
she
comes
from
lisle
in
france
and
teaches
french
do
you
like
the
teachers
well
enough
do
you
like
the
little
black
one
and
the
madame
i
cannot
pronounce
her
name
as
you
do
miss
scatcherd
is
hasty
you
must
take
care
not
to
offend
her
madame
pierrot
is
not
a
bad
sort
of
person
but
miss
temple
is
the
best
isn
t
she
miss
temple
is
very
good
and
very
clever
she
is
above
the
rest
because
she
knows
far
more
than
they
do
have
you
been
long
here
two
years
are
you
an
orphan
my
mother
is
dead
are
you
happy
here
you
ask
rather
too
many
questions
i
have
given
you
answers
enough
for
the
present
now
i
want
to
read
but
at
that
moment
the
summons
sounded
for
dinner
all
re
entered
the
house
the
odour
which
now
filled
the
refectory
was
scarcely
more
appetising
than
that
which
had
regaled
our
nostrils
at
breakfast
the
dinner
was
served
in
two
huge
tin
plated
vessels
whence
rose
a
strong
steam
redolent
of
rancid
fat
i
found
the
mess
to
consist
of
indifferent
potatoes
and
strange
shreds
of
rusty
meat
mixed
and
cooked
together
of
this
preparation
a
tolerably
abundant
plateful
was
apportioned
to
each
pupil
i
ate
what
i
could
and
wondered
within
myself
whether
every
day
s
fare
would
be
like
this
after
dinner
we
immediately
adjourned
to
the
schoolroom
lessons
recommenced
and
were
continued
till
five
o
clock
the
only
marked
event
of
the
afternoon
was
that
i
saw
the
girl
with
whom
i
had
conversed
in
the
verandah
dismissed
in
disgrace
by
miss
scatcherd
from
a
history
class
and
sent
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
large
schoolroom
the
punishment
seemed
to
me
in
a
high
degree
ignominious
especially
for
so
great
a
girl
she
looked
thirteen
or
upwards
i
expected
she
would
show
signs
of
great
distress
and
shame
but
to
my
surprise
she
neither
wept
nor
blushed
composed
though
grave
she
stood
the
central
mark
of
all
eyes
how
can
she
bear
it
so
quietly
so
firmly
i
asked
of
myself
were
i
in
her
place
it
seems
to
me
i
should
wish
the
earth
to
open
and
swallow
me
up
she
looks
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
something
beyond
her
punishment
beyond
her
situation
of
something
not
round
her
nor
before
her
i
have
heard
of
day
dreams
is
she
in
a
day
dream
now
her
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
floor
but
i
am
sure
they
do
not
see
it
her
sight
seems
turned
in
gone
down
into
her
heart
she
is
looking
at
what
she
can
remember
i
believe
not
at
what
is
really
present
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
girl
she
is
whether
good
or
naughty
soon
after
five
p
m
we
had
another
meal
consisting
of
a
small
mug
of
coffee
and
half
a
slice
of
brown
bread
i
devoured
my
bread
and
drank
my
coffee
with
relish
but
i
should
have
been
glad
of
as
much
more
i
was
still
hungry
half
an
hour
s
recreation
succeeded
then
study
then
the
glass
of
water
and
the
piece
of
oat
cake
prayers
and
bed
such
was
my
first
day
at
lowood
chapter
vi
the
next
day
commenced
as
before
getting
up
and
dressing
by
rushlight
but
this
morning
we
were
obliged
to
dispense
with
the
ceremony
of
washing
the
water
in
the
pitchers
was
frozen
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
weather
the
preceding
evening
and
a
keen
north
east
wind
whistling
through
the
crevices
of
our
bedroom
windows
all
night
long
had
made
us
shiver
in
our
beds
and
turned
the
contents
of
the
ewers
to
ice
before
the
long
hour
and
a
half
of
prayers
and
bible
reading
was
over
i
felt
ready
to
perish
with
cold
breakfast
time
came
at
last
and
this
morning
the
porridge
was
not
burnt
the
quality
was
eatable
the
quantity
small
how
small
my
portion
seemed
i
wished
it
had
been
doubled
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
was
enrolled
a
member
of
the
fourth
class
and
regular
tasks
and
occupations
were
assigned
me
hitherto
i
had
only
been
a
spectator
of
the
proceedings
at
lowood
i
was
now
to
become
an
actor
therein
at
first
being
little
accustomed
to
learn
by
heart
the
lessons
appeared
to
me
both
long
and
difficult
the
frequent
change
from
task
to
task
too
bewildered
me
and
i
was
glad
when
about
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
miss
smith
put
into
my
hands
a
border
of
muslin
two
yards
long
together
with
needle
thimble
c
and
sent
me
to
sit
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
schoolroom
with
directions
to
hem
the
same
at
that
hour
most
of
the
others
were
sewing
likewise
but
one
class
still
stood
round
miss
scatcherd
s
chair
reading
and
as
all
was
quiet
the
subject
of
their
lessons
could
be
heard
together
with
the
manner
in
which
each
girl
acquitted
herself
and
the
animadversions
or
commendations
of
miss
scatcherd
on
the
performance
it
was
english
history
among
the
readers
i
observed
my
acquaintance
of
the
verandah
at
the
commencement
of
the
lesson
her
place
had
been
at
the
top
of
the
class
but
for
some
error
of
pronunciation
or
some
inattention
to
stops
she
was
suddenly
sent
to
the
very
bottom
even
in
that
obscure
position
miss
scatcherd
continued
to
make
her
an
object
of
constant
notice
she
was
continually
addressing
to
her
such
phrases
as
the
following
burns
such
it
seems
was
her
name
the
girls
here
were
all
called
by
their
surnames
as
boys
are
elsewhere
burns
you
are
standing
on
the
side
of
your
shoe
turn
your
toes
out
immediately
burns
you
poke
your
chin
most
unpleasantly
draw
it
in
burns
i
insist
on
your
holding
your
head
up
i
will
not
have
you
before
me
in
that
attitude
c
c
a
chapter
having
been
read
through
twice
the
books
were
closed
and
the
girls
examined
the
lesson
had
comprised
part
of
the
reign
of
charles
i
and
there
were
sundry
questions
about
tonnage
and
poundage
and
ship
money
which
most
of
them
appeared
unable
to
answer
still
every
little
difficulty
was
solved
instantly
when
it
reached
burns
her
memory
seemed
to
have
retained
the
substance
of
the
whole
lesson
and
she
was
ready
with
answers
on
every
point
i
kept
expecting
that
miss
scatcherd
would
praise
her
attention
but
instead
of
that
she
suddenly
cried
out
you
dirty
disagreeable
girl
you
have
never
cleaned
your
nails
this
morning
burns
made
no
answer
i
wondered
at
her
silence
why
thought
i
does
she
not
explain
that
she
could
neither
clean
her
nails
nor
wash
her
face
as
the
water
was
frozen
my
attention
was
now
called
off
by
miss
smith
desiring
me
to
hold
a
skein
of
thread
while
she
was
winding
it
she
talked
to
me
from
time
to
time
asking
whether
i
had
ever
been
at
school
before
whether
i
could
mark
stitch
knit
c
till
she
dismissed
me
i
could
not
pursue
my
observations
on
miss
scatcherd
s
movements
when
i
returned
to
my
seat
that
lady
was
just
delivering
an
order
of
which
i
did
not
catch
the
import
but
burns
immediately
left
the
class
and
going
into
the
small
inner
room
where
the
books
were
kept
returned
in
half
a
minute
carrying
in
her
hand
a
bundle
of
twigs
tied
together
at
one
end
this
ominous
tool
she
presented
to
miss
scatcherd
with
a
respectful
curtesy
then
she
quietly
and
without
being
told
unloosed
her
pinafore
and
the
teacher
instantly
and
sharply
inflicted
on
her
neck
a
dozen
strokes
with
the
bunch
of
twigs
not
a
tear
rose
to
burns
eye
and
while
i
paused
from
my
sewing
because
my
fingers
quivered
at
this
spectacle
with
a
sentiment
of
unavailing
and
impotent
anger
not
a
feature
of
her
pensive
face
altered
its
ordinary
expression
hardened
girl
exclaimed
miss
scatcherd
nothing
can
correct
you
of
your
slatternly
habits
carry
the
rod
away
burns
obeyed
i
looked
at
her
narrowly
as
she
emerged
from
the
book
closet
she
was
just
putting
back
her
handkerchief
into
her
pocket
and
the
trace
of
a
tear
glistened
on
her
thin
cheek
the
play
hour
in
the
evening
i
thought
the
pleasantest
fraction
of
the
day
at
lowood
the
bit
of
bread
the
draught
of
coffee
swallowed
at
five
o
clock
had
revived
vitality
if
it
had
not
satisfied
hunger
the
long
restraint
of
the
day
was
slackened
the
schoolroom
felt
warmer
than
in
the
morning
its
fires
being
allowed
to
burn
a
little
more
brightly
to
supply
in
some
measure
the
place
of
candles
not
yet
introduced
the
ruddy
gloaming
the
licensed
uproar
the
confusion
of
many
voices
gave
one
a
welcome
sense
of
liberty
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
i
had
seen
miss
scatcherd
flog
her
pupil
burns
i
wandered
as
usual
among
the
forms
and
tables
and
laughing
groups
without
a
companion
yet
not
feeling
lonely
when
i
passed
the
windows
i
now
and
then
lifted
a
blind
and
looked
out
it
snowed
fast
a
drift
was
already
forming
against
the
lower
panes
putting
my
ear
close
to
the
window
i
could
distinguish
from
the
gleeful
tumult
within
the
disconsolate
moan
of
the
wind
outside
probably
if
i
had
lately
left
a
good
home
and
kind
parents
this
would
have
been
the
hour
when
i
should
most
keenly
have
regretted
the
separation
that
wind
would
then
have
saddened
my
heart
this
obscure
chaos
would
have
disturbed
my
peace
as
it
was
i
derived
from
both
a
strange
excitement
and
reckless
and
feverish
i
wished
the
wind
to
howl
more
wildly
the
gloom
to
deepen
to
darkness
and
the
confusion
to
rise
to
clamour
jumping
over
forms
and
creeping
under
tables
i
made
my
way
to
one
of
the
fire
places
there
kneeling
by
the
high
wire
fender
i
found
burns
absorbed
silent
abstracted
from
all
round
her
by
the
companionship
of
a
book
which
she
read
by
the
dim
glare
of
the
embers
is
it
still
rasselas
i
asked
coming
behind
her
yes
she
said
and
i
have
just
finished
it
and
in
five
minutes
more
she
shut
it
up
i
was
glad
of
this
now
thought
i
i
can
perhaps
get
her
to
talk
i
sat
down
by
her
on
the
floor
what
is
your
name
besides
burns
helen
do
you
come
a
long
way
from
here
i
come
from
a
place
farther
north
quite
on
the
borders
of
scotland
will
you
ever
go
back
i
hope
so
but
nobody
can
be
sure
of
the
future
you
must
wish
to
leave
lowood
no
why
should
i
i
was
sent
to
lowood
to
get
an
education
and
it
would
be
of
no
use
going
away
until
i
have
attained
that
object
but
that
teacher
miss
scatcherd
is
so
cruel
to
you
cruel
not
at
all
she
is
severe
she
dislikes
my
faults
and
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
dislike
her
i
should
resist
her
if
she
struck
me
with
that
rod
i
should
get
it
from
her
hand
i
should
break
it
under
her
nose
probably
you
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
but
if
you
did
mr
brocklehurst
would
expel
you
from
the
school
that
would
be
a
great
grief
to
your
relations
it
is
far
better
to
endure
patiently
a
smart
which
nobody
feels
but
yourself
than
to
commit
a
hasty
action
whose
evil
consequences
will
extend
to
all
connected
with
you
and
besides
the
bible
bids
us
return
good
for
evil
but
then
it
seems
disgraceful
to
be
flogged
and
to
be
sent
to
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
room
full
of
people
and
you
are
such
a
great
girl
i
am
far
younger
than
you
and
i
could
not
bear
it
yet
it
would
be
your
duty
to
bear
it
if
you
could
not
avoid
it
it
is
weak
and
silly
to
say
you
cannot
bear
what
it
is
your
fate
to
be
required
to
bear
i
heard
her
with
wonder
i
could
not
comprehend
this
doctrine
of
endurance
and
still
less
could
i
understand
or
sympathise
with
the
forbearance
she
expressed
for
her
chastiser
still
i
felt
that
helen
burns
considered
things
by
a
light
invisible
to
my
eyes
i
suspected
she
might
be
right
and
i
wrong
but
i
would
not
ponder
the
matter
deeply
like
felix
i
put
it
off
to
a
more
convenient
season
you
say
you
have
faults
helen
what
are
they
to
me
you
seem
very
good
then
learn
from
me
not
to
judge
by
appearances
i
am
as
miss
scatcherd
said
slatternly
i
seldom
put
and
never
keep
things
in
order
i
am
careless
i
forget
rules
i
read
when
i
should
learn
my
lessons
i
have
no
method
and
sometimes
i
say
like
you
i
cannot
bear
to
be
subjected
to
systematic
arrangements
this
is
all
very
provoking
to
miss
scatcherd
who
is
naturally
neat
punctual
and
particular
and
cross
and
cruel
i
added
but
helen
burns
would
not
admit
my
addition
she
kept
silence
is
miss
temple
as
severe
to
you
as
miss
scatcherd
at
the
utterance
of
miss
temple
s
name
a
soft
smile
flitted
over
her
grave
face
miss
temple
is
full
of
goodness
it
pains
her
to
be
severe
to
any
one
even
the
worst
in
the
school
she
sees
my
errors
and
tells
me
of
them
gently
and
if
i
do
anything
worthy
of
praise
she
gives
me
my
meed
liberally
one
strong
proof
of
my
wretchedly
defective
nature
is
that
even
her
expostulations
so
mild
so
rational
have
not
influence
to
cure
me
of
my
faults
and
even
her
praise
though
i
value
it
most
highly
cannot
stimulate
me
to
continued
care
and
foresight
that
is
curious
said
i
it
is
so
easy
to
be
careful
for
you
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
i
observed
you
in
your
class
this
morning
and
saw
you
were
closely
attentive
your
thoughts
never
seemed
to
wander
while
miss
miller
explained
the
lesson
and
questioned
you
now
mine
continually
rove
away
when
i
should
be
listening
to
miss
scatcherd
and
collecting
all
she
says
with
assiduity
often
i
lose
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
i
fall
into
a
sort
of
dream
sometimes
i
think
i
am
in
northumberland
and
that
the
noises
i
hear
round
me
are
the
bubbling
of
a
little
brook
which
runs
through
deepden
near
our
house
then
when
it
comes
to
my
turn
to
reply
i
have
to
be
awakened
and
having
heard
nothing
of
what
was
read
for
listening
to
the
visionary
brook
i
have
no
answer
ready
yet
how
well
you
replied
this
afternoon
it
was
mere
chance
the
subject
on
which
we
had
been
reading
had
interested
me
this
afternoon
instead
of
dreaming
of
deepden
i
was
wondering
how
a
man
who
wished
to
do
right
could
act
so
unjustly
and
unwisely
as
charles
the
first
sometimes
did
and
i
thought
what
a
pity
it
was
that
with
his
integrity
and
conscientiousness
he
could
see
no
farther
than
the
prerogatives
of
the
crown
if
he
had
but
been
able
to
look
to
a
distance
and
see
how
what
they
call
the
spirit
of
the
age
was
tending
still
i
like
charles
i
respect
him
i
pity
him
poor
murdered
king
yes
his
enemies
were
the
worst
they
shed
blood
they
had
no
right
to
shed
how
dared
they
kill
him
helen
was
talking
to
herself
now
she
had
forgotten
i
could
not
very
well
understand
her
that
i
was
ignorant
or
nearly
so
of
the
subject
she
discussed
i
recalled
her
to
my
level
and
when
miss
temple
teaches
you
do
your
thoughts
wander
then
no
certainly
not
often
because
miss
temple
has
generally
something
to
say
which
is
newer
than
my
own
reflections
her
language
is
singularly
agreeable
to
me
and
the
information
she
communicates
is
often
just
what
i
wished
to
gain
well
then
with
miss
temple
you
are
good
yes
in
a
passive
way
i
make
no
effort
i
follow
as
inclination
guides
me
there
is
no
merit
in
such
goodness
a
great
deal
you
are
good
to
those
who
are
good
to
you
it
is
all
i
ever
desire
to
be
if
people
were
always
kind
and
obedient
to
those
who
are
cruel
and
unjust
the
wicked
people
would
have
it
all
their
own
way
they
would
never
feel
afraid
and
so
they
would
never
alter
but
would
grow
worse
and
worse
when
we
are
struck
at
without
a
reason
we
should
strike
back
again
very
hard
i
am
sure
we
should
so
hard
as
to
teach
the
person
who
struck
us
never
to
do
it
again
you
will
change
your
mind
i
hope
when
you
grow
older
as
yet
you
are
but
a
little
untaught
girl
but
i
feel
this
helen
i
must
dislike
those
who
whatever
i
do
to
please
them
persist
in
disliking
me
i
must
resist
those
who
punish
me
unjustly
it
is
as
natural
as
that
i
should
love
those
who
show
me
affection
or
submit
to
punishment
when
i
feel
it
is
deserved
heathens
and
savage
tribes
hold
that
doctrine
but
christians
and
civilised
nations
disown
it
how
i
don
t
understand
it
is
not
violence
that
best
overcomes
hate
nor
vengeance
that
most
certainly
heals
injury
what
then
read
the
new
testament
and
observe
what
christ
says
and
how
he
acts
make
his
word
your
rule
and
his
conduct
your
example
what
does
he
say
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
despitefully
use
you
then
i
should
love
mrs
reed
which
i
cannot
do
i
should
bless
her
son
john
which
is
impossible
in
her
turn
helen
burns
asked
me
to
explain
and
i
proceeded
forthwith
to
pour
out
in
my
own
way
the
tale
of
my
sufferings
and
resentments
bitter
and
truculent
when
excited
i
spoke
as
i
felt
without
reserve
or
softening
helen
heard
me
patiently
to
the
end
i
expected
she
would
then
make
a
remark
but
she
said
nothing
well
i
asked
impatiently
is
not
mrs
reed
a
hard
hearted
bad
woman
she
has
been
unkind
to
you
no
doubt
because
you
see
she
dislikes
your
cast
of
character
as
miss
scatcherd
does
mine
but
how
minutely
you
remember
all
she
has
done
and
said
to
you
what
a
singularly
deep
impression
her
injustice
seems
to
have
made
on
your
heart
no
ill
usage
so
brands
its
record
on
my
feelings
would
you
not
be
happier
if
you
tried
to
forget
her
severity
together
with
the
passionate
emotions
it
excited
life
appears
to
me
too
short
to
be
spent
in
nursing
animosity
or
registering
wrongs
we
are
and
must
be
one
and
all
burdened
with
faults
in
this
world
but
the
time
will
soon
come
when
i
trust
we
shall
put
them
off
in
putting
off
our
corruptible
bodies
when
debasement
and
sin
will
fall
from
us
with
this
cumbrous
frame
of
flesh
and
only
the
spark
of
the
spirit
will
remain
the
impalpable
principle
of
light
and
thought
pure
as
when
it
left
the
creator
to
inspire
the
creature
whence
it
came
it
will
return
perhaps
again
to
be
communicated
to
some
being
higher
than
man
perhaps
to
pass
through
gradations
of
glory
from
the
pale
human
soul
to
brighten
to
the
seraph
surely
it
will
never
on
the
contrary
be
suffered
to
degenerate
from
man
to
fiend
no
i
cannot
believe
that
i
hold
another
creed
which
no
one
ever
taught
me
and
which
i
seldom
mention
but
in
which
i
delight
and
to
which
i
cling
for
it
extends
hope
to
all
it
makes
eternity
a
rest
a
mighty
home
not
a
terror
and
an
abyss
besides
with
this
creed
i
can
so
clearly
distinguish
between
the
criminal
and
his
crime
i
can
so
sincerely
forgive
the
first
while
i
abhor
the
last
with
this
creed
revenge
never
worries
my
heart
degradation
never
too
deeply
disgusts
me
injustice
never
crushes
me
too
low
i
live
in
calm
looking
to
the
end
helen
s
head
always
drooping
sank
a
little
lower
as
she
finished
this
sentence
i
saw
by
her
look
she
wished
no
longer
to
talk
to
me
but
rather
to
converse
with
her
own
thoughts
she
was
not
allowed
much
time
for
meditation
a
monitor
a
great
rough
girl
presently
came
up
exclaiming
in
a
strong
cumberland
accent
helen
burns
if
you
don
t
go
and
put
your
drawer
in
order
and
fold
up
your
work
this
minute
i
ll
tell
miss
scatcherd
to
come
and
look
at
it
helen
sighed
as
her
reverie
fled
and
getting
up
obeyed
the
monitor
without
reply
as
without
delay
chapter
vii
my
first
quarter
at
lowood
seemed
an
age
and
not
the
golden
age
either
it
comprised
an
irksome
struggle
with
difficulties
in
habituating
myself
to
new
rules
and
unwonted
tasks
the
fear
of
failure
in
these
points
harassed
me
worse
than
the
physical
hardships
of
my
lot
though
these
were
no
trifles
during
january
february
and
part
of
march
the
deep
snows
and
after
their
melting
the
almost
impassable
roads
prevented
our
stirring
beyond
the
garden
walls
except
to
go
to
church
but
within
these
limits
we
had
to
pass
an
hour
every
day
in
the
open
air
our
clothing
was
insufficient
to
protect
us
from
the
severe
cold
we
had
no
boots
the
snow
got
into
our
shoes
and
melted
there
our
ungloved
hands
became
numbed
and
covered
with
chilblains
as
were
our
feet
i
remember
well
the
distracting
irritation
i
endured
from
this
cause
every
evening
when
my
feet
inflamed
and
the
torture
of
thrusting
the
swelled
raw
and
stiff
toes
into
my
shoes
in
the
morning
then
the
scanty
supply
of
food
was
distressing
with
the
keen
appetites
of
growing
children
we
had
scarcely
sufficient
to
keep
alive
a
delicate
invalid
from
this
deficiency
of
nourishment
resulted
an
abuse
which
pressed
hardly
on
the
younger
pupils
whenever
the
famished
great
girls
had
an
opportunity
they
would
coax
or
menace
the
little
ones
out
of
their
portion
many
a
time
i
have
shared
between
two
claimants
the
precious
morsel
of
brown
bread
distributed
at
tea
time
and
after
relinquishing
to
a
third
half
the
contents
of
my
mug
of
coffee
i
have
swallowed
the
remainder
with
an
accompaniment
of
secret
tears
forced
from
me
by
the
exigency
of
hunger
sundays
were
dreary
days
in
that
wintry
season
we
had
to
walk
two
miles
to
brocklebridge
church
where
our
patron
officiated
we
set
out
cold
we
arrived
at
church
colder
during
the
morning
service
we
became
almost
paralysed
it
was
too
far
to
return
to
dinner
and
an
allowance
of
cold
meat
and
bread
in
the
same
penurious
proportion
observed
in
our
ordinary
meals
was
served
round
between
the
services
at
the
close
of
the
afternoon
service
we
returned
by
an
exposed
and
hilly
road
where
the
bitter
winter
wind
blowing
over
a
range
of
snowy
summits
to
the
north
almost
flayed
the
skin
from
our
faces
i
can
remember
miss
temple
walking
lightly
and
rapidly
along
our
drooping
line
her
plaid
cloak
which
the
frosty
wind
fluttered
gathered
close
about
her
and
encouraging
us
by
precept
and
example
to
keep
up
our
spirits
and
march
forward
as
she
said
like
stalwart
soldiers
the
other
teachers
poor
things
were
generally
themselves
too
much
dejected
to
attempt
the
task
of
cheering
others
how
we
longed
for
the
light
and
heat
of
a
blazing
fire
when
we
got
back
but
to
the
little
ones
at
least
this
was
denied
each
hearth
in
the
schoolroom
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
double
row
of
great
girls
and
behind
them
the
younger
children
crouched
in
groups
wrapping
their
starved
arms
in
their
pinafores
a
little
solace
came
at
tea
time
in
the
shape
of
a
double
ration
of
bread
a
whole
instead
of
a
half
slice
with
the
delicious
addition
of
a
thin
scrape
of
butter
it
was
the
hebdomadal
treat
to
which
we
all
looked
forward
from
sabbath
to
sabbath
i
generally
contrived
to
reserve
a
moiety
of
this
bounteous
repast
for
myself
but
the
remainder
i
was
invariably
obliged
to
part
with
the
sunday
evening
was
spent
in
repeating
by
heart
the
church
catechism
and
the
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
chapters
of
st
matthew
and
in
listening
to
a
long
sermon
read
by
miss
miller
whose
irrepressible
yawns
attested
her
weariness
a
frequent
interlude
of
these
performances
was
the
enactment
of
the
part
of
eutychus
by
some
half
dozen
of
little
girls
who
overpowered
with
sleep
would
fall
down
if
not
out
of
the
third
loft
yet
off
the
fourth
form
and
be
taken
up
half
dead
the
remedy
was
to
thrust
them
forward
into
the
centre
of
the
schoolroom
and
oblige
them
to
stand
there
till
the
sermon
was
finished
sometimes
their
feet
failed
them
and
they
sank
together
in
a
heap
they
were
then
propped
up
with
the
monitors
high
stools
i
have
not
yet
alluded
to
the
visits
of
mr
brocklehurst
and
indeed
that
gentleman
was
from
home
during
the
greater
part
of
the
first
month
after
my
arrival
perhaps
prolonging
his
stay
with
his
friend
the
archdeacon
his
absence
was
a
relief
to
me
i
need
not
say
that
i
had
my
own
reasons
for
dreading
his
coming
but
come
he
did
at
last
one
afternoon
i
had
then
been
three
weeks
at
lowood
as
i
was
sitting
with
a
slate
in
my
hand
puzzling
over
a
sum
in
long
division
my
eyes
raised
in
abstraction
to
the
window
caught
sight
of
a
figure
just
passing
i
recognised
almost
instinctively
that
gaunt
outline
and
when
two
minutes
after
all
the
school
teachers
included
rose
en
masse
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
look
up
in
order
to
ascertain
whose
entrance
they
thus
greeted
a
long
stride
measured
the
schoolroom
and
presently
beside
miss
temple
who
herself
had
risen
stood
the
same
black
column
which
had
frowned
on
me
so
ominously
from
the
hearthrug
of
gateshead
i
now
glanced
sideways
at
this
piece
of
architecture
yes
i
was
right
it
was
mr
brocklehurst
buttoned
up
in
a
surtout
and
looking
longer
narrower
and
more
rigid
than
ever
i
had
my
own
reasons
for
being
dismayed
at
this
apparition
too
well
i
remembered
the
perfidious
hints
given
by
mrs
reed
about
my
disposition
c
the
promise
pledged
by
mr
brocklehurst
to
apprise
miss
temple
and
the
teachers
of
my
vicious
nature
all
along
i
had
been
dreading
the
fulfilment
of
this
promise
i
had
been
looking
out
daily
for
the
coming
man
whose
information
respecting
my
past
life
and
conversation
was
to
brand
me
as
a
bad
child
for
ever
now
there
he
was
he
stood
at
miss
temple
s
side
he
was
speaking
low
in
her
ear
i
did
not
doubt
he
was
making
disclosures
of
my
villainy
and
i
watched
her
eye
with
painful
anxiety
expecting
every
moment
to
see
its
dark
orb
turn
on
me
a
glance
of
repugnance
and
contempt
i
listened
too
and
as
i
happened
to
be
seated
quite
at
the
top
of
the
room
i
caught
most
of
what
he
said
its
import
relieved
me
from
immediate
apprehension
i
suppose
miss
temple
the
thread
i
bought
at
lowton
will
do
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
just
of
the
quality
for
the
calico
chemises
and
i
sorted
the
needles
to
match
you
may
tell
miss
smith
that
i
forgot
to
make
a
memorandum
of
the
darning
needles
but
she
shall
have
some
papers
sent
in
next
week
and
she
is
not
on
any
account
to
give
out
more
than
one
at
a
time
to
each
pupil
if
they
have
more
they
are
apt
to
be
careless
and
lose
them
and
o
ma
am
i
wish
the
woollen
stockings
were
better
looked
to
when
i
was
here
last
i
went
into
the
kitchen
garden
and
examined
the
clothes
drying
on
the
line
there
was
a
quantity
of
black
hose
in
a
very
bad
state
of
repair
from
the
size
of
the
holes
in
them
i
was
sure
they
had
not
been
well
mended
from
time
to
time
he
paused
your
directions
shall
be
attended
to
sir
said
miss
temple
and
ma
am
he
continued
the
laundress
tells
me
some
of
the
girls
have
two
clean
tuckers
in
the
week
it
is
too
much
the
rules
limit
them
to
one
i
think
i
can
explain
that
circumstance
sir
agnes
and
catherine
johnstone
were
invited
to
take
tea
with
some
friends
at
lowton
last
thursday
and
i
gave
them
leave
to
put
on
clean
tuckers
for
the
occasion
mr
brocklehurst
nodded
well
for
once
it
may
pass
but
please
not
to
let
the
circumstance
occur
too
often
and
there
is
another
thing
which
surprised
me
i
find
in
settling
accounts
with
the
housekeeper
that
a
lunch
consisting
of
bread
and
cheese
has
twice
been
served
out
to
the
girls
during
the
past
fortnight
how
is
this
i
looked
over
the
regulations
and
i
find
no
such
meal
as
lunch
mentioned
who
introduced
this
innovation
and
by
what
authority
i
must
be
responsible
for
the
circumstance
sir
replied
miss
temple
the
breakfast
was
so
ill
prepared
that
the
pupils
could
not
possibly
eat
it
and
i
dared
not
allow
them
to
remain
fasting
till
dinner
time
madam
allow
me
an
instant
you
are
aware
that
my
plan
in
bringing
up
these
girls
is
not
to
accustom
them
to
habits
of
luxury
and
indulgence
but
to
render
them
hardy
patient
self
denying
should
any
little
accidental
disappointment
of
the
appetite
occur
such
as
the
spoiling
of
a
meal
the
under
or
the
over
dressing
of
a
dish
the
incident
ought
not
to
be
neutralised
by
replacing
with
something
more
delicate
the
comfort
lost
thus
pampering
the
body
and
obviating
the
aim
of
this
institution
it
ought
to
be
improved
to
the
spiritual
edification
of
the
pupils
by
encouraging
them
to
evince
fortitude
under
temporary
privation
a
brief
address
on
those
occasions
would
not
be
mistimed
wherein
a
judicious
instructor
would
take
the
opportunity
of
referring
to
the
sufferings
of
the
primitive
christians
to
the
torments
of
martyrs
to
the
exhortations
of
our
blessed
lord
himself
calling
upon
his
disciples
to
take
up
their
cross
and
follow
him
to
his
warnings
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
to
his
divine
consolations
if
ye
suffer
hunger
or
thirst
for
my
sake
happy
are
ye
oh
madam
when
you
put
bread
and
cheese
instead
of
burnt
porridge
into
these
children
s
mouths
you
may
indeed
feed
their
vile
bodies
but
you
little
think
how
you
starve
their
immortal
souls
mr
brocklehurst
again
paused
perhaps
overcome
by
his
feelings
miss
temple
had
looked
down
when
he
first
began
to
speak
to
her
but
she
now
gazed
straight
before
her
and
her
face
naturally
pale
as
marble
appeared
to
be
assuming
also
the
coldness
and
fixity
of
that
material
especially
her
mouth
closed
as
if
it
would
have
required
a
sculptor
s
chisel
to
open
it
and
her
brow
settled
gradually
into
petrified
severity
meantime
mr
brocklehurst
standing
on
the
hearth
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
majestically
surveyed
the
whole
school
suddenly
his
eye
gave
a
blink
as
if
it
had
met
something
that
either
dazzled
or
shocked
its
pupil
turning
he
said
in
more
rapid
accents
than
he
had
hitherto
used
miss
temple
miss
temple
what
what
is
that
girl
with
curled
hair
red
hair
ma
am
curled
curled
all
over
and
extending
his
cane
he
pointed
to
the
awful
object
his
hand
shaking
as
he
did
so
it
is
julia
severn
replied
miss
temple
very
quietly
julia
severn
ma
am
and
why
has
she
or
any
other
curled
hair
why
in
defiance
of
every
precept
and
principle
of
this
house
does
she
conform
to
the
world
so
openly
here
in
an
evangelical
charitable
establishment
as
to
wear
her
hair
one
mass
of
curls
julia
s
hair
curls
naturally
returned
miss
temple
still
more
quietly
naturally
yes
but
we
are
not
to
conform
to
nature
i
wish
these
girls
to
be
the
children
of
grace
and
why
that
abundance
i
have
again
and
again
intimated
that
i
desire
the
hair
to
be
arranged
closely
modestly
plainly
miss
temple
that
girl
s
hair
must
be
cut
off
entirely
i
will
send
a
barber
to
morrow
and
i
see
others
who
have
far
too
much
of
the
excrescence
that
tall
girl
tell
her
to
turn
round
tell
all
the
first
form
to
rise
up
and
direct
their
faces
to
the
wall
miss
temple
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
lips
as
if
to
smooth
away
the
involuntary
smile
that
curled
them
she
gave
the
order
however
and
when
the
first
class
could
take
in
what
was
required
of
them
they
obeyed
leaning
a
little
back
on
my
bench
i
could
see
the
looks
and
grimaces
with
which
they
commented
on
this
manoeuvre
it
was
a
pity
mr
brocklehurst
could
not
see
them
too
he
would
perhaps
have
felt
that
whatever
he
might
do
with
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
the
inside
was
further
beyond
his
interference
than
he
imagined
he
scrutinised
the
reverse
of
these
living
medals
some
five
minutes
then
pronounced
sentence
these
words
fell
like
the
knell
of
doom
all
those
top
knots
must
be
cut
off
miss
temple
seemed
to
remonstrate
madam
he
pursued
i
have
a
master
to
serve
whose
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
my
mission
is
to
mortify
in
these
girls
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
to
teach
them
to
clothe
themselves
with
shame
facedness
and
sobriety
not
with
braided
hair
and
costly
apparel
and
each
of
the
young
persons
before
us
has
a
string
of
hair
twisted
in
plaits
which
vanity
itself
might
have
woven
these
i
repeat
must
be
cut
off
think
of
the
time
wasted
of
mr
brocklehurst
was
here
interrupted
three
other
visitors
ladies
now
entered
the
room
they
ought
to
have
come
a
little
sooner
to
have
heard
his
lecture
on
dress
for
they
were
splendidly
attired
in
velvet
silk
and
furs
the
two
younger
of
the
trio
fine
girls
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
had
grey
beaver
hats
then
in
fashion
shaded
with
ostrich
plumes
and
from
under
the
brim
of
this
graceful
head
dress
fell
a
profusion
of
light
tresses
elaborately
curled
the
elder
lady
was
enveloped
in
a
costly
velvet
shawl
trimmed
with
ermine
and
she
wore
a
false
front
of
french
curls
these
ladies
were
deferentially
received
by
miss
temple
as
mrs
and
the
misses
brocklehurst
and
conducted
to
seats
of
honour
at
the
top
of
the
room
it
seems
they
had
come
in
the
carriage
with
their
reverend
relative
and
had
been
conducting
a
rummaging
scrutiny
of
the
room
upstairs
while
he
transacted
business
with
the
housekeeper
questioned
the
laundress
and
lectured
the
superintendent
they
now
proceeded
to
address
divers
remarks
and
reproofs
to
miss
smith
who
was
charged
with
the
care
of
the
linen
and
the
inspection
of
the
dormitories
but
i
had
no
time
to
listen
to
what
they
said
other
matters
called
off
and
enchanted
my
attention
hitherto
while
gathering
up
the
discourse
of
mr
brocklehurst
and
miss
temple
i
had
not
at
the
same
time
neglected
precautions
to
secure
my
personal
safety
which
i
thought
would
be
effected
if
i
could
only
elude
observation
to
this
end
i
had
sat
well
back
on
the
form
and
while
seeming
to
be
busy
with
my
sum
had
held
my
slate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
conceal
my
face
i
might
have
escaped
notice
had
not
my
treacherous
slate
somehow
happened
to
slip
from
my
hand
and
falling
with
an
obtrusive
crash
directly
drawn
every
eye
upon
me
i
knew
it
was
all
over
now
and
as
i
stooped
to
pick
up
the
two
fragments
of
slate
i
rallied
my
forces
for
the
worst
it
came
a
careless
girl
said
mr
brocklehurst
and
immediately
after
it
is
the
new
pupil
i
perceive
and
before
i
could
draw
breath
i
must
not
forget
i
have
a
word
to
say
respecting
her
then
aloud
how
loud
it
seemed
to
me
let
the
child
who
broke
her
slate
come
forward
of
my
own
accord
i
could
not
have
stirred
i
was
paralysed
but
the
two
great
girls
who
sit
on
each
side
of
me
set
me
on
my
legs
and
pushed
me
towards
the
dread
judge
and
then
miss
temple
gently
assisted
me
to
his
very
feet
and
i
caught
her
whispered
counsel
don
t
be
afraid
jane
i
saw
it
was
an
accident
you
shall
not
be
punished
the
kind
whisper
went
to
my
heart
like
a
dagger
another
minute
and
she
will
despise
me
for
a
hypocrite
thought
i
and
an
impulse
of
fury
against
reed
brocklehurst
and
co
bounded
in
my
pulses
at
the
conviction
i
was
no
helen
burns
fetch
that
stool
said
mr
brocklehurst
pointing
to
a
very
high
one
from
which
a
monitor
had
just
risen
it
was
brought
place
the
child
upon
it
and
i
was
placed
there
by
whom
i
don
t
know
i
was
in
no
condition
to
note
particulars
i
was
only
aware
that
they
had
hoisted
me
up
to
the
height
of
mr
brocklehurst
s
nose
that
he
was
within
a
yard
of
me
and
that
a
spread
of
shot
orange
and
purple
silk
pelisses
and
a
cloud
of
silvery
plumage
extended
and
waved
below
me
mr
brocklehurst
hemmed
ladies
said
he
turning
to
his
family
miss
temple
teachers
and
children
you
all
see
this
girl
of
course
they
did
for
i
felt
their
eyes
directed
like
burning
glasses
against
my
scorched
skin
you
see
she
is
yet
young
you
observe
she
possesses
the
ordinary
form
of
childhood
god
has
graciously
given
her
the
shape
that
he
has
given
to
all
of
us
no
signal
deformity
points
her
out
as
a
marked
character
who
would
think
that
the
evil
one
had
already
found
a
servant
and
agent
in
her
yet
such
i
grieve
to
say
is
the
case
a
pause
in
which
i
began
to
steady
the
palsy
of
my
nerves
and
to
feel
that
the
rubicon
was
passed
and
that
the
trial
no
longer
to
be
shirked
must
be
firmly
sustained
my
dear
children
pursued
the
black
marble
clergyman
with
pathos
this
is
a
sad
a
melancholy
occasion
for
it
becomes
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
this
girl
who
might
be
one
of
god
s
own
lambs
is
a
little
castaway
not
a
member
of
the
true
flock
but
evidently
an
interloper
and
an
alien
you
must
be
on
your
guard
against
her
you
must
shun
her
example
if
necessary
avoid
her
company
exclude
her
from
your
sports
and
shut
her
out
from
your
converse
teachers
you
must
watch
her
keep
your
eyes
on
her
movements
weigh
well
her
words
scrutinise
her
actions
punish
her
body
to
save
her
soul
if
indeed
such
salvation
be
possible
for
my
tongue
falters
while
i
tell
it
this
girl
this
child
the
native
of
a
christian
land
worse
than
many
a
little
heathen
who
says
its
prayers
to
brahma
and
kneels
before
juggernaut
this
girl
is
a
liar
now
came
a
pause
of
ten
minutes
during
which
i
by
this
time
in
perfect
possession
of
my
wits
observed
all
the
female
brocklehursts
produce
their
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
apply
them
to
their
optics
while
the
elderly
lady
swayed
herself
to
and
fro
and
the
two
younger
ones
whispered
how
shocking
mr
brocklehurst
resumed
this
i
learned
from
her
benefactress
from
the
pious
and
charitable
lady
who
adopted
her
in
her
orphan
state
reared
her
as
her
own
daughter
and
whose
kindness
whose
generosity
the
unhappy
girl
repaid
by
an
ingratitude
so
bad
so
dreadful
that
at
last
her
excellent
patroness
was
obliged
to
separate
her
from
her
own
young
ones
fearful
lest
her
vicious
example
should
contaminate
their
purity
she
has
sent
her
here
to
be
healed
even
as
the
jews
of
old
sent
their
diseased
to
the
troubled
pool
of
bethesda
and
teachers
superintendent
i
beg
of
you
not
to
allow
the
waters
to
stagnate
round
her
with
this
sublime
conclusion
mr
brocklehurst
adjusted
the
top
button
of
his
surtout
muttered
something
to
his
family
who
rose
bowed
to
miss
temple
and
then
all
the
great
people
sailed
in
state
from
the
room
turning
at
the
door
my
judge
said
let
her
stand
half
an
hour
longer
on
that
stool
and
let
no
one
speak
to
her
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
there
was
i
then
mounted
aloft
i
who
had
said
i
could
not
bear
the
shame
of
standing
on
my
natural
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
now
exposed
to
general
view
on
a
pedestal
of
infamy
what
my
sensations
were
no
language
can
describe
but
just
as
they
all
rose
stifling
my
breath
and
constricting
my
throat
a
girl
came
up
and
passed
me
in
passing
she
lifted
her
eyes
what
a
strange
light
inspired
them
what
an
extraordinary
sensation
that
ray
sent
through
me
how
the
new
feeling
bore
me
up
it
was
as
if
a
martyr
a
hero
had
passed
a
slave
or
victim
and
imparted
strength
in
the
transit
i
mastered
the
rising
hysteria
lifted
up
my
head
and
took
a
firm
stand
on
the
stool
helen
burns
asked
some
slight
question
about
her
work
of
miss
smith
was
chidden
for
the
triviality
of
the
inquiry
returned
to
her
place
and
smiled
at
me
as
she
again
went
by
what
a
smile
i
remember
it
now
and
i
know
that
it
was
the
effluence
of
fine
intellect
of
true
courage
it
lit
up
her
marked
lineaments
her
thin
face
her
sunken
grey
eye
like
a
reflection
from
the
aspect
of
an
angel
yet
at
that
moment
helen
burns
wore
on
her
arm
the
untidy
badge
scarcely
an
hour
ago
i
had
heard
her
condemned
by
miss
scatcherd
to
a
dinner
of
bread
and
water
on
the
morrow
because
she
had
blotted
an
exercise
in
copying
it
out
such
is
the
imperfect
nature
of
man
such
spots
are
there
on
the
disc
of
the
clearest
planet
and
eyes
like
miss
scatcherd
s
can
only
see
those
minute
defects
and
are
blind
to
the
full
brightness
of
the
orb
chapter
viii
ere
the
half
hour
ended
five
o
clock
struck
school
was
dismissed
and
all
were
gone
into
the
refectory
to
tea
i
now
ventured
to
descend
it
was
deep
dusk
i
retired
into
a
corner
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
the
spell
by
which
i
had
been
so
far
supported
began
to
dissolve
reaction
took
place
and
soon
so
overwhelming
was
the
grief
that
seized
me
i
sank
prostrate
with
my
face
to
the
ground
now
i
wept
helen
burns
was
not
here
nothing
sustained
me
left
to
myself
i
abandoned
myself
and
my
tears
watered
the
boards
i
had
meant
to
be
so
good
and
to
do
so
much
at
lowood
to
make
so
many
friends
to
earn
respect
and
win
affection
already
i
had
made
visible
progress
that
very
morning
i
had
reached
the
head
of
my
class
miss
miller
had
praised
me
warmly
miss
temple
had
smiled
approbation
she
had
promised
to
teach
me
drawing
and
to
let
me
learn
french
if
i
continued
to
make
similar
improvement
two
months
longer
and
then
i
was
well
received
by
my
fellow
pupils
treated
as
an
equal
by
those
of
my
own
age
and
not
molested
by
any
now
here
i
lay
again
crushed
and
trodden
on
and
could
i
ever
rise
more
never
i
thought
and
ardently
i
wished
to
die
while
sobbing
out
this
wish
in
broken
accents
some
one
approached
i
started
up
again
helen
burns
was
near
me
the
fading
fires
just
showed
her
coming
up
the
long
vacant
room
she
brought
my
coffee
and
bread
come
eat
something
she
said
but
i
put
both
away
from
me
feeling
as
if
a
drop
or
a
crumb
would
have
choked
me
in
my
present
condition
helen
regarded
me
probably
with
surprise
i
could
not
now
abate
my
agitation
though
i
tried
hard
i
continued
to
weep
aloud
she
sat
down
on
the
ground
near
me
embraced
her
knees
with
her
arms
and
rested
her
head
upon
them
in
that
attitude
she
remained
silent
as
an
indian
i
was
the
first
who
spoke
helen
why
do
you
stay
with
a
girl
whom
everybody
believes
to
be
a
liar
everybody
jane
why
there
are
only
eighty
people
who
have
heard
you
called
so
and
the
world
contains
hundreds
of
millions
but
what
have
i
to
do
with
millions
the
eighty
i
know
despise
me
jane
you
are
mistaken
probably
not
one
in
the
school
either
despises
or
dislikes
you
many
i
am
sure
pity
you
much
how
can
they
pity
me
after
what
mr
brocklehurst
has
said
mr
brocklehurst
is
not
a
god
nor
is
he
even
a
great
and
admired
man
he
is
little
liked
here
he
never
took
steps
to
make
himself
liked
had
he
treated
you
as
an
especial
favourite
you
would
have
found
enemies
declared
or
covert
all
around
you
as
it
is
the
greater
number
would
offer
you
sympathy
if
they
dared
teachers
and
pupils
may
look
coldly
on
you
for
a
day
or
two
but
friendly
feelings
are
concealed
in
their
hearts
and
if
you
persevere
in
doing
well
these
feelings
will
ere
long
appear
so
much
the
more
evidently
for
their
temporary
suppression
besides
jane
she
paused
well
helen
said
i
putting
my
hand
into
hers
she
chafed
my
fingers
gently
to
warm
them
and
went
on
if
all
the
world
hated
you
and
believed
you
wicked
while
your
own
conscience
approved
you
and
absolved
you
from
guilt
you
would
not
be
without
friends
no
i
know
i
should
think
well
of
myself
but
that
is
not
enough
if
others
don
t
love
me
i
would
rather
die
than
live
i
cannot
bear
to
be
solitary
and
hated
helen
look
here
to
gain
some
real
affection
from
you
or
miss
temple
or
any
other
whom
i
truly
love
i
would
willingly
submit
to
have
the
bone
of
my
arm
broken
or
to
let
a
bull
toss
me
or
to
stand
behind
a
kicking
horse
and
let
it
dash
its
hoof
at
my
chest
hush
jane
you
think
too
much
of
the
love
of
human
beings
you
are
too
impulsive
too
vehement
the
sovereign
hand
that
created
your
frame
and
put
life
into
it
has
provided
you
with
other
resources
than
your
feeble
self
or
than
creatures
feeble
as
you
besides
this
earth
and
besides
the
race
of
men
there
is
an
invisible
world
and
a
kingdom
of
spirits
that
world
is
round
us
for
it
is
everywhere
and
those
spirits
watch
us
for
they
are
commissioned
to
guard
us
and
if
we
were
dying
in
pain
and
shame
if
scorn
smote
us
on
all
sides
and
hatred
crushed
us
angels
see
our
tortures
recognise
our
innocence
if
innocent
we
be
as
i
know
you
are
of
this
charge
which
mr
brocklehurst
has
weakly
and
pompously
repeated
at
second
hand
from
mrs
reed
for
i
read
a
sincere
nature
in
your
ardent
eyes
and
on
your
clear
front
and
god
waits
only
the
separation
of
spirit
from
flesh
to
crown
us
with
a
full
reward
why
then
should
we
ever
sink
overwhelmed
with
distress
when
life
is
so
soon
over
and
death
is
so
certain
an
entrance
to
happiness
to
glory
i
was
silent
helen
had
calmed
me
but
in
the
tranquillity
she
imparted
there
was
an
alloy
of
inexpressible
sadness
i
felt
the
impression
of
woe
as
she
spoke
but
i
could
not
tell
whence
it
came
and
when
having
done
speaking
she
breathed
a
little
fast
and
coughed
a
short
cough
i
momentarily
forgot
my
own
sorrows
to
yield
to
a
vague
concern
for
her
resting
my
head
on
helen
s
shoulder
i
put
my
arms
round
her
waist
she
drew
me
to
her
and
we
reposed
in
silence
we
had
not
sat
long
thus
when
another
person
came
in
some
heavy
clouds
swept
from
the
sky
by
a
rising
wind
had
left
the
moon
bare
and
her
light
streaming
in
through
a
window
near
shone
full
both
on
us
and
on
the
approaching
figure
which
we
at
once
recognised
as
miss
temple
i
came
on
purpose
to
find
you
jane
eyre
said
she
i
want
you
in
my
room
and
as
helen
burns
is
with
you
she
may
come
too
we
went
following
the
superintendent
s
guidance
we
had
to
thread
some
intricate
passages
and
mount
a
staircase
before
we
reached
her
apartment
it
contained
a
good
fire
and
looked
cheerful
miss
temple
told
helen
burns
to
be
seated
in
a
low
arm
chair
on
one
side
of
the
hearth
and
herself
taking
another
she
called
me
to
her
side
is
it
all
over
she
asked
looking
down
at
my
face
have
you
cried
your
grief
away
i
am
afraid
i
never
shall
do
that
why
because
i
have
been
wrongly
accused
and
you
ma
am
and
everybody
else
will
now
think
me
wicked
we
shall
think
you
what
you
prove
yourself
to
be
my
child
continue
to
act
as
a
good
girl
and
you
will
satisfy
us
shall
i
miss
temple
you
will
said
she
passing
her
arm
round
me
and
now
tell
me
who
is
the
lady
whom
mr
brocklehurst
called
your
benefactress
mrs
reed
my
uncle
s
wife
my
uncle
is
dead
and
he
left
me
to
her
care
did
she
not
then
adopt
you
of
her
own
accord
no
ma
am
she
was
sorry
to
have
to
do
it
but
my
uncle
as
i
have
often
heard
the
servants
say
got
her
to
promise
before
he
died
that
she
would
always
keep
me
well
now
jane
you
know
or
at
least
i
will
tell
you
that
when
a
criminal
is
accused
he
is
always
allowed
to
speak
in
his
own
defence
you
have
been
charged
with
falsehood
defend
yourself
to
me
as
well
as
you
can
say
whatever
your
memory
suggests
is
true
but
add
nothing
and
exaggerate
nothing
i
resolved
in
the
depth
of
my
heart
that
i
would
be
most
moderate
most
correct
and
having
reflected
a
few
minutes
in
order
to
arrange
coherently
what
i
had
to
say
i
told
her
all
the
story
of
my
sad
childhood
exhausted
by
emotion
my
language
was
more
subdued
than
it
generally
was
when
it
developed
that
sad
theme
and
mindful
of
helen
s
warnings
against
the
indulgence
of
resentment
i
infused
into
the
narrative
far
less
of
gall
and
wormwood
than
ordinary
thus
restrained
and
simplified
it
sounded
more
credible
i
felt
as
i
went
on
that
miss
temple
fully
believed
me
in
the
course
of
the
tale
i
had
mentioned
mr
lloyd
as
having
come
to
see
me
after
the
fit
for
i
never
forgot
the
to
me
frightful
episode
of
the
red
room
in
detailing
which
my
excitement
was
sure
in
some
degree
to
break
bounds
for
nothing
could
soften
in
my
recollection
the
spasm
of
agony
which
clutched
my
heart
when
mrs
reed
spurned
my
wild
supplication
for
pardon
and
locked
me
a
second
time
in
the
dark
and
haunted
chamber
i
had
finished
miss
temple
regarded
me
a
few
minutes
in
silence
she
then
said
i
know
something
of
mr
lloyd
i
shall
write
to
him
if
his
reply
agrees
with
your
statement
you
shall
be
publicly
cleared
from
every
imputation
to
me
jane
you
are
clear
now
she
kissed
me
and
still
keeping
me
at
her
side
where
i
was
well
contented
to
stand
for
i
derived
a
child
s
pleasure
from
the
contemplation
of
her
face
her
dress
her
one
or
two
ornaments
her
white
forehead
her
clustered
and
shining
curls
and
beaming
dark
eyes
she
proceeded
to
address
helen
burns
how
are
you
to
night
helen
have
you
coughed
much
to
day
not
quite
so
much
i
think
ma
am
and
the
pain
in
your
chest
it
is
a
little
better
miss
temple
got
up
took
her
hand
and
examined
her
pulse
then
she
returned
to
her
own
seat
as
she
resumed
it
i
heard
her
sigh
low
she
was
pensive
a
few
minutes
then
rousing
herself
she
said
cheerfully
but
you
two
are
my
visitors
to
night
i
must
treat
you
as
such
she
rang
her
bell
barbara
she
said
to
the
servant
who
answered
it
i
have
not
yet
had
tea
bring
the
tray
and
place
cups
for
these
two
young
ladies
and
a
tray
was
soon
brought
how
pretty
to
my
eyes
did
the
china
cups
and
bright
teapot
look
placed
on
the
little
round
table
near
the
fire
how
fragrant
was
the
steam
of
the
beverage
and
the
scent
of
the
toast
of
which
however
i
to
my
dismay
for
i
was
beginning
to
be
hungry
discerned
only
a
very
small
portion
miss
temple
discerned
it
too
barbara
said
she
can
you
not
bring
a
little
more
bread
and
butter
there
is
not
enough
for
three
barbara
went
out
she
returned
soon
madam
mrs
harden
says
she
has
sent
up
the
usual
quantity
mrs
harden
be
it
observed
was
the
housekeeper
a
woman
after
mr
brocklehurst
s
own
heart
made
up
of
equal
parts
of
whalebone
and
iron
oh
very
well
returned
miss
temple
we
must
make
it
do
barbara
i
suppose
and
as
the
girl
withdrew
she
added
smiling
fortunately
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
supply
deficiencies
for
this
once
having
invited
helen
and
me
to
approach
the
table
and
placed
before
each
of
us
a
cup
of
tea
with
one
delicious
but
thin
morsel
of
toast
she
got
up
unlocked
a
drawer
and
taking
from
it
a
parcel
wrapped
in
paper
disclosed
presently
to
our
eyes
a
good
sized
seed
cake
i
meant
to
give
each
of
you
some
of
this
to
take
with
you
said
she
but
as
there
is
so
little
toast
you
must
have
it
now
and
she
proceeded
to
cut
slices
with
a
generous
hand
we
feasted
that
evening
as
on
nectar
and
ambrosia
and
not
the
least
delight
of
the
entertainment
was
the
smile
of
gratification
with
which
our
hostess
regarded
us
as
we
satisfied
our
famished
appetites
on
the
delicate
fare
she
liberally
supplied
tea
over
and
the
tray
removed
she
again
summoned
us
to
the
fire
we
sat
one
on
each
side
of
her
and
now
a
conversation
followed
between
her
and
helen
which
it
was
indeed
a
privilege
to
be
admitted
to
hear
miss
temple
had
always
something
of
serenity
in
her
air
of
state
in
her
mien
of
refined
propriety
in
her
language
which
precluded
deviation
into
the
ardent
the
excited
the
eager
something
which
chastened
the
pleasure
of
those
who
looked
on
her
and
listened
to
her
by
a
controlling
sense
of
awe
and
such
was
my
feeling
now
but
as
to
helen
burns
i
was
struck
with
wonder
the
refreshing
meal
the
brilliant
fire
the
presence
and
kindness
of
her
beloved
instructress
or
perhaps
more
than
all
these
something
in
her
own
unique
mind
had
roused
her
powers
within
her
they
woke
they
kindled
first
they
glowed
in
the
bright
tint
of
her
cheek
which
till
this
hour
i
had
never
seen
but
pale
and
bloodless
then
they
shone
in
the
liquid
lustre
of
her
eyes
which
had
suddenly
acquired
a
beauty
more
singular
than
that
of
miss
temple
s
a
beauty
neither
of
fine
colour
nor
long
eyelash
nor
pencilled
brow
but
of
meaning
of
movement
of
radiance
then
her
soul
sat
on
her
lips
and
language
flowed
from
what
source
i
cannot
tell
has
a
girl
of
fourteen
a
heart
large
enough
vigorous
enough
to
hold
the
swelling
spring
of
pure
full
fervid
eloquence
such
was
the
characteristic
of
helen
s
discourse
on
that
to
me
memorable
evening
her
spirit
seemed
hastening
to
live
within
a
very
brief
span
as
much
as
many
live
during
a
protracted
existence
they
conversed
of
things
i
had
never
heard
of
of
nations
and
times
past
of
countries
far
away
of
secrets
of
nature
discovered
or
guessed
at
they
spoke
of
books
how
many
they
had
read
what
stores
of
knowledge
they
possessed
then
they
seemed
so
familiar
with
french
names
and
french
authors
but
my
amazement
reached
its
climax
when
miss
temple
asked
helen
if
she
sometimes
snatched
a
moment
to
recall
the
latin
her
father
had
taught
her
and
taking
a
book
from
a
shelf
bade
her
read
and
construe
a
page
of
virgil
and
helen
obeyed
my
organ
of
veneration
expanding
at
every
sounding
line
she
had
scarcely
finished
ere
the
bell
announced
bedtime
no
delay
could
be
admitted
miss
temple
embraced
us
both
saying
as
she
drew
us
to
her
heart
god
bless
you
my
children
helen
she
held
a
little
longer
than
me
she
let
her
go
more
reluctantly
it
was
helen
her
eye
followed
to
the
door
it
was
for
her
she
a
second
time
breathed
a
sad
sigh
for
her
she
wiped
a
tear
from
her
cheek
on
reaching
the
bedroom
we
heard
the
voice
of
miss
scatcherd
she
was
examining
drawers
she
had
just
pulled
out
helen
burns
s
and
when
we
entered
helen
was
greeted
with
a
sharp
reprimand
and
told
that
to
morrow
she
should
have
half
a
dozen
of
untidily
folded
articles
pinned
to
her
shoulder
my
things
were
indeed
in
shameful
disorder
murmured
helen
to
me
in
a
low
voice
i
intended
to
have
arranged
them
but
i
forgot
next
morning
miss
scatcherd
wrote
in
conspicuous
characters
on
a
piece
of
pasteboard
the
word
slattern
and
bound
it
like
a
phylactery
round
helen
s
large
mild
intelligent
and
benign
looking
forehead
she
wore
it
till
evening
patient
unresentful
regarding
it
as
a
deserved
punishment
the
moment
miss
scatcherd
withdrew
after
afternoon
school
i
ran
to
helen
tore
it
off
and
thrust
it
into
the
fire
the
fury
of
which
she
was
incapable
had
been
burning
in
my
soul
all
day
and
tears
hot
and
large
had
continually
been
scalding
my
cheek
for
the
spectacle
of
her
sad
resignation
gave
me
an
intolerable
pain
at
the
heart
about
a
week
subsequently
to
the
incidents
above
narrated
miss
temple
who
had
written
to
mr
lloyd
received
his
answer
it
appeared
that
what
he
said
went
to
corroborate
my
account
miss
temple
having
assembled
the
whole
school
announced
that
inquiry
had
been
made
into
the
charges
alleged
against
jane
eyre
and
that
she
was
most
happy
to
be
able
to
pronounce
her
completely
cleared
from
every
imputation
the
teachers
then
shook
hands
with
me
and
kissed
me
and
a
murmur
of
pleasure
ran
through
the
ranks
of
my
companions
thus
relieved
of
a
grievous
load
i
from
that
hour
set
to
work
afresh
resolved
to
pioneer
my
way
through
every
difficulty
i
toiled
hard
and
my
success
was
proportionate
to
my
efforts
my
memory
not
naturally
tenacious
improved
with
practice
exercise
sharpened
my
wits
in
a
few
weeks
i
was
promoted
to
a
higher
class
in
less
than
two
months
i
was
allowed
to
commence
french
and
drawing
i
learned
the
first
two
tenses
of
the
verb
etre
and
sketched
my
first
cottage
whose
walls
by
the
bye
outrivalled
in
slope
those
of
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
on
the
same
day
that
night
on
going
to
bed
i
forgot
to
prepare
in
imagination
the
barmecide
supper
of
hot
roast
potatoes
or
white
bread
and
new
milk
with
which
i
was
wont
to
amuse
my
inward
cravings
i
feasted
instead
on
the
spectacle
of
ideal
drawings
which
i
saw
in
the
dark
all
the
work
of
my
own
hands
freely
pencilled
houses
and
trees
picturesque
rocks
and
ruins
cuyp
like
groups
of
cattle
sweet
paintings
of
butterflies
hovering
over
unblown
roses
of
birds
picking
at
ripe
cherries
of
wren
s
nests
enclosing
pearl
like
eggs
wreathed
about
with
young
ivy
sprays
i
examined
too
in
thought
the
possibility
of
my
ever
being
able
to
translate
currently
a
certain
little
french
story
which
madame
pierrot
had
that
day
shown
me
nor
was
that
problem
solved
to
my
satisfaction
ere
i
fell
sweetly
asleep
well
has
solomon
said
better
is
a
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
than
a
stalled
ox
and
hatred
therewith
i
would
not
now
have
exchanged
lowood
with
all
its
privations
for
gateshead
and
its
daily
luxuries
chapter
ix
but
the
privations
or
rather
the
hardships
of
lowood
lessened
spring
drew
on
she
was
indeed
already
come
the
frosts
of
winter
had
ceased
its
snows
were
melted
its
cutting
winds
ameliorated
my
wretched
feet
flayed
and
swollen
to
lameness
by
the
sharp
air
of
january
began
to
heal
and
subside
under
the
gentler
breathings
of
april
the
nights
and
mornings
no
longer
by
their
canadian
temperature
froze
the
very
blood
in
our
veins
we
could
now
endure
the
play
hour
passed
in
the
garden
sometimes
on
a
sunny
day
it
began
even
to
be
pleasant
and
genial
and
a
greenness
grew
over
those
brown
beds
which
freshening
daily
suggested
the
thought
that
hope
traversed
them
at
night
and
left
each
morning
brighter
traces
of
her
steps
flowers
peeped
out
amongst
the
leaves
snow
drops
crocuses
purple
auriculas
and
golden
eyed
pansies
on
thursday
afternoons
half
holidays
we
now
took
walks
and
found
still
sweeter
flowers
opening
by
the
wayside
under
the
hedges
i
discovered
too
that
a
great
pleasure
an
enjoyment
which
the
horizon
only
bounded
lay
all
outside
the
high
and
spike
guarded
walls
of
our
garden
this
pleasure
consisted
in
prospect
of
noble
summits
girdling
a
great
hill
hollow
rich
in
verdure
and
shadow
in
a
bright
beck
full
of
dark
stones
and
sparkling
eddies
how
different
had
this
scene
looked
when
i
viewed
it
laid
out
beneath
the
iron
sky
of
winter
stiffened
in
frost
shrouded
with
snow
when
mists
as
chill
as
death
wandered
to
the
impulse
of
east
winds
along
those
purple
peaks
and
rolled
down
ing
and
holm
till
they
blended
with
the
frozen
fog
of
the
beck
that
beck
itself
was
then
a
torrent
turbid
and
curbless
it
tore
asunder
the
wood
and
sent
a
raving
sound
through
the
air
often
thickened
with
wild
rain
or
whirling
sleet
and
for
the
forest
on
its
banks
that
showed
only
ranks
of
skeletons
april
advanced
to
may
a
bright
serene
may
it
was
days
of
blue
sky
placid
sunshine
and
soft
western
or
southern
gales
filled
up
its
duration
and
now
vegetation
matured
with
vigour
lowood
shook
loose
its
tresses
it
became
all
green
all
flowery
its
great
elm
ash
and
oak
skeletons
were
restored
to
majestic
life
woodland
plants
sprang
up
profusely
in
its
recesses
unnumbered
varieties
of
moss
filled
its
hollows
and
it
made
a
strange
ground
sunshine
out
of
the
wealth
of
its
wild
primrose
plants
i
have
seen
their
pale
gold
gleam
in
overshadowed
spots
like
scatterings
of
the
sweetest
lustre
all
this
i
enjoyed
often
and
fully
free
unwatched
and
almost
alone
for
this
unwonted
liberty
and
pleasure
there
was
a
cause
to
which
it
now
becomes
my
task
to
advert
have
i
not
described
a
pleasant
site
for
a
dwelling
when
i
speak
of
it
as
bosomed
in
hill
and
wood
and
rising
from
the
verge
of
a
stream
assuredly
pleasant
enough
but
whether
healthy
or
not
is
another
question
that
forest
dell
where
lowood
lay
was
the
cradle
of
fog
and
fog
bred
pestilence
which
quickening
with
the
quickening
spring
crept
into
the
orphan
asylum
breathed
typhus
through
its
crowded
schoolroom
and
dormitory
and
ere
may
arrived
transformed
the
seminary
into
an
hospital
semi
starvation
and
neglected
colds
had
predisposed
most
of
the
pupils
to
receive
infection
forty
five
out
of
the
eighty
girls
lay
ill
at
one
time
classes
were
broken
up
rules
relaxed
the
few
who
continued
well
were
allowed
almost
unlimited
license
because
the
medical
attendant
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
frequent
exercise
to
keep
them
in
health
and
had
it
been
otherwise
no
one
had
leisure
to
watch
or
restrain
them
miss
temple
s
whole
attention
was
absorbed
by
the
patients
she
lived
in
the
sick
room
never
quitting
it
except
to
snatch
a
few
hours
rest
at
night
the
teachers
were
fully
occupied
with
packing
up
and
making
other
necessary
preparations
for
the
departure
of
those
girls
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
have
friends
and
relations
able
and
willing
to
remove
them
from
the
seat
of
contagion
many
already
smitten
went
home
only
to
die
some
died
at
the
school
and
were
buried
quietly
and
quickly
the
nature
of
the
malady
forbidding
delay
while
disease
had
thus
become
an
inhabitant
of
lowood
and
death
its
frequent
visitor
while
there
was
gloom
and
fear
within
its
walls
while
its
rooms
and
passages
steamed
with
hospital
smells
the
drug
and
the
pastille
striving
vainly
to
overcome
the
effluvia
of
mortality
that
bright
may
shone
unclouded
over
the
bold
hills
and
beautiful
woodland
out
of
doors
its
garden
too
glowed
with
flowers
hollyhocks
had
sprung
up
tall
as
trees
lilies
had
opened
tulips
and
roses
were
in
bloom
the
borders
of
the
little
beds
were
gay
with
pink
thrift
and
crimson
double
daisies
the
sweetbriars
gave
out
morning
and
evening
their
scent
of
spice
and
apples
and
these
fragrant
treasures
were
all
useless
for
most
of
the
inmates
of
lowood
except
to
furnish
now
and
then
a
handful
of
herbs
and
blossoms
to
put
in
a
coffin
but
i
and
the
rest
who
continued
well
enjoyed
fully
the
beauties
of
the
scene
and
season
they
let
us
ramble
in
the
wood
like
gipsies
from
morning
till
night
we
did
what
we
liked
went
where
we
liked
we
lived
better
too
mr
brocklehurst
and
his
family
never
came
near
lowood
now
household
matters
were
not
scrutinised
into
the
cross
housekeeper
was
gone
driven
away
by
the
fear
of
infection
her
successor
who
had
been
matron
at
the
lowton
dispensary
unused
to
the
ways
of
her
new
abode
provided
with
comparative
liberality
besides
there
were
fewer
to
feed
the
sick
could
eat
little
our
breakfast
basins
were
better
filled
when
there
was
no
time
to
prepare
a
regular
dinner
which
often
happened
she
would
give
us
a
large
piece
of
cold
pie
or
a
thick
slice
of
bread
and
cheese
and
this
we
carried
away
with
us
to
the
wood
where
we
each
chose
the
spot
we
liked
best
and
dined
sumptuously
my
favourite
seat
was
a
smooth
and
broad
stone
rising
white
and
dry
from
the
very
middle
of
the
beck
and
only
to
be
got
at
by
wading
through
the
water
a
feat
i
accomplished
barefoot
the
stone
was
just
broad
enough
to
accommodate
comfortably
another
girl
and
me
at
that
time
my
chosen
comrade
one
mary
ann
wilson
a
shrewd
observant
personage
whose
society
i
took
pleasure
in
partly
because
she
was
witty
and
original
and
partly
because
she
had
a
manner
which
set
me
at
my
ease
some
years
older
than
i
she
knew
more
of
the
world
and
could
tell
me
many
things
i
liked
to
hear
with
her
my
curiosity
found
gratification
to
my
faults
also
she
gave
ample
indulgence
never
imposing
curb
or
rein
on
anything
i
said
she
had
a
turn
for
narrative
i
for
analysis
she
liked
to
inform
i
to
question
so
we
got
on
swimmingly
together
deriving
much
entertainment
if
not
much
improvement
from
our
mutual
intercourse
and
where
meantime
was
helen
burns
why
did
i
not
spend
these
sweet
days
of
liberty
with
her
had
i
forgotten
her
or
was
i
so
worthless
as
to
have
grown
tired
of
her
pure
society
surely
the
mary
ann
wilson
i
have
mentioned
was
inferior
to
my
first
acquaintance
she
could
only
tell
me
amusing
stories
and
reciprocate
any
racy
and
pungent
gossip
i
chose
to
indulge
in
while
if
i
have
spoken
truth
of
helen
she
was
qualified
to
give
those
who
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
her
converse
a
taste
of
far
higher
things
true
reader
and
i
knew
and
felt
this
and
though
i
am
a
defective
being
with
many
faults
and
few
redeeming
points
yet
i
never
tired
of
helen
burns
nor
ever
ceased
to
cherish
for
her
a
sentiment
of
attachment
as
strong
tender
and
respectful
as
any
that
ever
animated
my
heart
how
could
it
be
otherwise
when
helen
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
evinced
for
me
a
quiet
and
faithful
friendship
which
ill
humour
never
soured
nor
irritation
never
troubled
but
helen
was
ill
at
present
for
some
weeks
she
had
been
removed
from
my
sight
to
i
knew
not
what
room
upstairs
she
was
not
i
was
told
in
the
hospital
portion
of
the
house
with
the
fever
patients
for
her
complaint
was
consumption
not
typhus
and
by
consumption
i
in
my
ignorance
understood
something
mild
which
time
and
care
would
be
sure
to
alleviate
i
was
confirmed
in
this
idea
by
the
fact
of
her
once
or
twice
coming
downstairs
on
very
warm
sunny
afternoons
and
being
taken
by
miss
temple
into
the
garden
but
on
these
occasions
i
was
not
allowed
to
go
and
speak
to
her
i
only
saw
her
from
the
schoolroom
window
and
then
not
distinctly
for
she
was
much
wrapped
up
and
sat
at
a
distance
under
the
verandah
one
evening
in
the
beginning
of
june
i
had
stayed
out
very
late
with
mary
ann
in
the
wood
we
had
as
usual
separated
ourselves
from
the
others
and
had
wandered
far
so
far
that
we
lost
our
way
and
had
to
ask
it
at
a
lonely
cottage
where
a
man
and
woman
lived
who
looked
after
a
herd
of
half
wild
swine
that
fed
on
the
mast
in
the
wood
when
we
got
back
it
was
after
moonrise
a
pony
which
we
knew
to
be
the
surgeon
s
was
standing
at
the
garden
door
mary
ann
remarked
that
she
supposed
some
one
must
be
very
ill
as
mr
bates
had
been
sent
for
at
that
time
of
the
evening
she
went
into
the
house
i
stayed
behind
a
few
minutes
to
plant
in
my
garden
a
handful
of
roots
i
had
dug
up
in
the
forest
and
which
i
feared
would
wither
if
i
left
them
till
the
morning
this
done
i
lingered
yet
a
little
longer
the
flowers
smelt
so
sweet
as
the
dew
fell
it
was
such
a
pleasant
evening
so
serene
so
warm
the
still
glowing
west
promised
so
fairly
another
fine
day
on
the
morrow
the
moon
rose
with
such
majesty
in
the
grave
east
i
was
noting
these
things
and
enjoying
them
as
a
child
might
when
it
entered
my
mind
as
it
had
never
done
before
how
sad
to
be
lying
now
on
a
sick
bed
and
to
be
in
danger
of
dying
this
world
is
pleasant
it
would
be
dreary
to
be
called
from
it
and
to
have
to
go
who
knows
where
and
then
my
mind
made
its
first
earnest
effort
to
comprehend
what
had
been
infused
into
it
concerning
heaven
and
hell
and
for
the
first
time
it
recoiled
baffled
and
for
the
first
time
glancing
behind
on
each
side
and
before
it
it
saw
all
round
an
unfathomed
gulf
it
felt
the
one
point
where
it
stood
the
present
all
the
rest
was
formless
cloud
and
vacant
depth
and
it
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
tottering
and
plunging
amid
that
chaos
while
pondering
this
new
idea
i
heard
the
front
door
open
mr
bates
came
out
and
with
him
was
a
nurse
after
she
had
seen
him
mount
his
horse
and
depart
she
was
about
to
close
the
door
but
i
ran
up
to
her
how
is
helen
burns
very
poorly
was
the
answer
is
it
her
mr
bates
has
been
to
see
yes
and
what
does
he
say
about
her
he
says
she
ll
not
be
here
long
this
phrase
uttered
in
my
hearing
yesterday
would
have
only
conveyed
the
notion
that
she
was
about
to
be
removed
to
northumberland
to
her
own
home
i
should
not
have
suspected
that
it
meant
she
was
dying
but
i
knew
instantly
now
it
opened
clear
on
my
comprehension
that
helen
burns
was
numbering
her
last
days
in
this
world
and
that
she
was
going
to
be
taken
to
the
region
of
spirits
if
such
region
there
were
i
experienced
a
shock
of
horror
then
a
strong
thrill
of
grief
then
a
desire
a
necessity
to
see
her
and
i
asked
in
what
room
she
lay
she
is
in
miss
temple
s
room
said
the
nurse
may
i
go
up
and
speak
to
her
oh
no
child
it
is
not
likely
and
now
it
is
time
for
you
to
come
in
you
ll
catch
the
fever
if
you
stop
out
when
the
dew
is
falling
the
nurse
closed
the
front
door
i
went
in
by
the
side
entrance
which
led
to
the
schoolroom
i
was
just
in
time
it
was
nine
o
clock
and
miss
miller
was
calling
the
pupils
to
go
to
bed
it
might
be
two
hours
later
probably
near
eleven
when
i
not
having
been
able
to
fall
asleep
and
deeming
from
the
perfect
silence
of
the
dormitory
that
my
companions
were
all
wrapt
in
profound
repose
rose
softly
put
on
my
frock
over
my
night
dress
and
without
shoes
crept
from
the
apartment
and
set
off
in
quest
of
miss
temple
s
room
it
was
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
but
i
knew
my
way
and
the
light
of
the
unclouded
summer
moon
entering
here
and
there
at
passage
windows
enabled
me
to
find
it
without
difficulty
an
odour
of
camphor
and
burnt
vinegar
warned
me
when
i
came
near
the
fever
room
and
i
passed
its
door
quickly
fearful
lest
the
nurse
who
sat
up
all
night
should
hear
me
i
dreaded
being
discovered
and
sent
back
for
i
must
see
helen
i
must
embrace
her
before
she
died
i
must
give
her
one
last
kiss
exchange
with
her
one
last
word
having
descended
a
staircase
traversed
a
portion
of
the
house
below
and
succeeded
in
opening
and
shutting
without
noise
two
doors
i
reached
another
flight
of
steps
these
i
mounted
and
then
just
opposite
to
me
was
miss
temple
s
room
a
light
shone
through
the
keyhole
and
from
under
the
door
a
profound
stillness
pervaded
the
vicinity
coming
near
i
found
the
door
slightly
ajar
probably
to
admit
some
fresh
air
into
the
close
abode
of
sickness
indisposed
to
hesitate
and
full
of
impatient
impulses
soul
and
senses
quivering
with
keen
throes
i
put
it
back
and
looked
in
my
eye
sought
helen
and
feared
to
find
death
close
by
miss
temple
s
bed
and
half
covered
with
its
white
curtains
there
stood
a
little
crib
i
saw
the
outline
of
a
form
under
the
clothes
but
the
face
was
hid
by
the
hangings
the
nurse
i
had
spoken
to
in
the
garden
sat
in
an
easy
chair
asleep
an
unsnuffed
candle
burnt
dimly
on
the
table
miss
temple
was
not
to
be
seen
i
knew
afterwards
that
she
had
been
called
to
a
delirious
patient
in
the
fever
room
i
advanced
then
paused
by
the
crib
side
my
hand
was
on
the
curtain
but
i
preferred
speaking
before
i
withdrew
it
i
still
recoiled
at
the
dread
of
seeing
a
corpse
helen
i
whispered
softly
are
you
awake
she
stirred
herself
put
back
the
curtain
and
i
saw
her
face
pale
wasted
but
quite
composed
she
looked
so
little
changed
that
my
fear
was
instantly
dissipated
can
it
be
you
jane
she
asked
in
her
own
gentle
voice
oh
i
thought
she
is
not
going
to
die
they
are
mistaken
she
could
not
speak
and
look
so
calmly
if
she
were
i
got
on
to
her
crib
and
kissed
her
her
forehead
was
cold
and
her
cheek
both
cold
and
thin
and
so
were
her
hand
and
wrist
but
she
smiled
as
of
old
why
are
you
come
here
jane
it
is
past
eleven
o
clock
i
heard
it
strike
some
minutes
since
i
came
to
see
you
helen
i
heard
you
were
very
ill
and
i
could
not
sleep
till
i
had
spoken
to
you
you
came
to
bid
me
good
bye
then
you
are
just
in
time
probably
are
you
going
somewhere
helen
are
you
going
home
yes
to
my
long
home
my
last
home
no
no
helen
i
stopped
distressed
while
i
tried
to
devour
my
tears
a
fit
of
coughing
seized
helen
it
did
not
however
wake
the
nurse
when
it
was
over
she
lay
some
minutes
exhausted
then
she
whispered
jane
your
little
feet
are
bare
lie
down
and
cover
yourself
with
my
quilt
i
did
so
she
put
her
arm
over
me
and
i
nestled
close
to
her
after
a
long
silence
she
resumed
still
whispering
i
am
very
happy
jane
and
when
you
hear
that
i
am
dead
you
must
be
sure
and
not
grieve
there
is
nothing
to
grieve
about
we
all
must
die
one
day
and
the
illness
which
is
removing
me
is
not
painful
it
is
gentle
and
gradual
my
mind
is
at
rest
i
leave
no
one
to
regret
me
much
i
have
only
a
father
and
he
is
lately
married
and
will
not
miss
me
by
dying
young
i
shall
escape
great
sufferings
i
had
not
qualities
or
talents
to
make
my
way
very
well
in
the
world
i
should
have
been
continually
at
fault
but
where
are
you
going
to
helen
can
you
see
do
you
know
i
believe
i
have
faith
i
am
going
to
god
where
is
god
what
is
god
my
maker
and
yours
who
will
never
destroy
what
he
created
i
rely
implicitly
on
his
power
and
confide
wholly
in
his
goodness
i
count
the
hours
till
that
eventful
one
arrives
which
shall
restore
me
to
him
reveal
him
to
me
you
are
sure
then
helen
that
there
is
such
a
place
as
heaven
and
that
our
souls
can
get
to
it
when
we
die
i
am
sure
there
is
a
future
state
i
believe
god
is
good
i
can
resign
my
immortal
part
to
him
without
any
misgiving
god
is
my
father
god
is
my
friend
i
love
him
i
believe
he
loves
me
and
shall
i
see
you
again
helen
when
i
die
you
will
come
to
the
same
region
of
happiness
be
received
by
the
same
mighty
universal
parent
no
doubt
dear
jane
again
i
questioned
but
this
time
only
in
thought
where
is
that
region
does
it
exist
and
i
clasped
my
arms
closer
round
helen
she
seemed
dearer
to
me
than
ever
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
let
her
go
i
lay
with
my
face
hidden
on
her
neck
presently
she
said
in
the
sweetest
tone
how
comfortable
i
am
that
last
fit
of
coughing
has
tired
me
a
little
i
feel
as
if
i
could
sleep
but
don
t
leave
me
jane
i
like
to
have
you
near
me
i
ll
stay
with
you
dear
helen
no
one
shall
take
me
away
are
you
warm
darling
yes
good
night
jane
good
night
helen
she
kissed
me
and
i
her
and
we
both
soon
slumbered
when
i
awoke
it
was
day
an
unusual
movement
roused
me
i
looked
up
i
was
in
somebody
s
arms
the
nurse
held
me
she
was
carrying
me
through
the
passage
back
to
the
dormitory
i
was
not
reprimanded
for
leaving
my
bed
people
had
something
else
to
think
about
no
explanation
was
afforded
then
to
my
many
questions
but
a
day
or
two
afterwards
i
learned
that
miss
temple
on
returning
to
her
own
room
at
dawn
had
found
me
laid
in
the
little
crib
my
face
against
helen
burns
s
shoulder
my
arms
round
her
neck
i
was
asleep
and
helen
was
dead
her
grave
is
in
brocklebridge
churchyard
for
fifteen
years
after
her
death
it
was
only
covered
by
a
grassy
mound
but
now
a
grey
marble
tablet
marks
the
spot
inscribed
with
her
name
and
the
word
resurgam
chapter
x
hitherto
i
have
recorded
in
detail
the
events
of
my
insignificant
existence
to
the
first
ten
years
of
my
life
i
have
given
almost
as
many
chapters
but
this
is
not
to
be
a
regular
autobiography
i
am
only
bound
to
invoke
memory
where
i
know
her
responses
will
possess
some
degree
of
interest
therefore
i
now
pass
a
space
of
eight
years
almost
in
silence
a
few
lines
only
are
necessary
to
keep
up
the
links
of
connection
when
the
typhus
fever
had
fulfilled
its
mission
of
devastation
at
lowood
it
gradually
disappeared
from
thence
but
not
till
its
virulence
and
the
number
of
its
victims
had
drawn
public
attention
on
the
school
inquiry
was
made
into
the
origin
of
the
scourge
and
by
degrees
various
facts
came
out
which
excited
public
indignation
in
a
high
degree
the
unhealthy
nature
of
the
site
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
children
s
food
the
brackish
fetid
water
used
in
its
preparation
the
pupils
wretched
clothing
and
accommodations
all
these
things
were
discovered
and
the
discovery
produced
a
result
mortifying
to
mr
brocklehurst
but
beneficial
to
the
institution
several
wealthy
and
benevolent
individuals
in
the
county
subscribed
largely
for
the
erection
of
a
more
convenient
building
in
a
better
situation
new
regulations
were
made
improvements
in
diet
and
clothing
introduced
the
funds
of
the
school
were
intrusted
to
the
management
of
a
committee
mr
brocklehurst
who
from
his
wealth
and
family
connections
could
not
be
overlooked
still
retained
the
post
of
treasurer
but
he
was
aided
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
by
gentlemen
of
rather
more
enlarged
and
sympathising
minds
his
office
of
inspector
too
was
shared
by
those
who
knew
how
to
combine
reason
with
strictness
comfort
with
economy
compassion
with
uprightness
the
school
thus
improved
became
in
time
a
truly
useful
and
noble
institution
i
remained
an
inmate
of
its
walls
after
its
regeneration
for
eight
years
six
as
pupil
and
two
as
teacher
and
in
both
capacities
i
bear
my
testimony
to
its
value
and
importance
during
these
eight
years
my
life
was
uniform
but
not
unhappy
because
it
was
not
inactive
i
had
the
means
of
an
excellent
education
placed
within
my
reach
a
fondness
for
some
of
my
studies
and
a
desire
to
excel
in
all
together
with
a
great
delight
in
pleasing
my
teachers
especially
such
as
i
loved
urged
me
on
i
availed
myself
fully
of
the
advantages
offered
me
in
time
i
rose
to
be
the
first
girl
of
the
first
class
then
i
was
invested
with
the
office
of
teacher
which
i
discharged
with
zeal
for
two
years
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
altered
miss
temple
through
all
changes
had
thus
far
continued
superintendent
of
the
seminary
to
her
instruction
i
owed
the
best
part
of
my
acquirements
her
friendship
and
society
had
been
my
continual
solace
she
had
stood
me
in
the
stead
of
mother
governess
and
latterly
companion
at
this
period
she
married
removed
with
her
husband
a
clergyman
an
excellent
man
almost
worthy
of
such
a
wife
to
a
distant
county
and
consequently
was
lost
to
me
from
the
day
she
left
i
was
no
longer
the
same
with
her
was
gone
every
settled
feeling
every
association
that
had
made
lowood
in
some
degree
a
home
to
me
i
had
imbibed
from
her
something
of
her
nature
and
much
of
her
habits
more
harmonious
thoughts
what
seemed
better
regulated
feelings
had
become
the
inmates
of
my
mind
i
had
given
in
allegiance
to
duty
and
order
i
was
quiet
i
believed
i
was
content
to
the
eyes
of
others
usually
even
to
my
own
i
appeared
a
disciplined
and
subdued
character
but
destiny
in
the
shape
of
the
rev
mr
nasmyth
came
between
me
and
miss
temple
i
saw
her
in
her
travelling
dress
step
into
a
post
chaise
shortly
after
the
marriage
ceremony
i
watched
the
chaise
mount
the
hill
and
disappear
beyond
its
brow
and
then
retired
to
my
own
room
and
there
spent
in
solitude
the
greatest
part
of
the
half
holiday
granted
in
honour
of
the
occasion
i
walked
about
the
chamber
most
of
the
time
i
imagined
myself
only
to
be
regretting
my
loss
and
thinking
how
to
repair
it
but
when
my
reflections
were
concluded
and
i
looked
up
and
found
that
the
afternoon
was
gone
and
evening
far
advanced
another
discovery
dawned
on
me
namely
that
in
the
interval
i
had
undergone
a
transforming
process
that
my
mind
had
put
off
all
it
had
borrowed
of
miss
temple
or
rather
that
she
had
taken
with
her
the
serene
atmosphere
i
had
been
breathing
in
her
vicinity
and
that
now
i
was
left
in
my
natural
element
and
beginning
to
feel
the
stirring
of
old
emotions
it
did
not
seem
as
if
a
prop
were
withdrawn
but
rather
as
if
a
motive
were
gone
it
was
not
the
power
to
be
tranquil
which
had
failed
me
but
the
reason
for
tranquillity
was
no
more
my
world
had
for
some
years
been
in
lowood
my
experience
had
been
of
its
rules
and
systems
now
i
remembered
that
the
real
world
was
wide
and
that
a
varied
field
of
hopes
and
fears
of
sensations
and
excitements
awaited
those
who
had
courage
to
go
forth
into
its
expanse
to
seek
real
knowledge
of
life
amidst
its
perils
i
went
to
my
window
opened
it
and
looked
out
there
were
the
two
wings
of
the
building
there
was
the
garden
there
were
the
skirts
of
lowood
there
was
the
hilly
horizon
my
eye
passed
all
other
objects
to
rest
on
those
most
remote
the
blue
peaks
it
was
those
i
longed
to
surmount
all
within
their
boundary
of
rock
and
heath
seemed
prison
ground
exile
limits
i
traced
the
white
road
winding
round
the
base
of
one
mountain
and
vanishing
in
a
gorge
between
two
how
i
longed
to
follow
it
farther
i
recalled
the
time
when
i
had
travelled
that
very
road
in
a
coach
i
remembered
descending
that
hill
at
twilight
an
age
seemed
to
have
elapsed
since
the
day
which
brought
me
first
to
lowood
and
i
had
never
quitted
it
since
my
vacations
had
all
been
spent
at
school
mrs
reed
had
never
sent
for
me
to
gateshead
neither
she
nor
any
of
her
family
had
ever
been
to
visit
me
i
had
had
no
communication
by
letter
or
message
with
the
outer
world
school
rules
school
duties
school
habits
and
notions
and
voices
and
faces
and
phrases
and
costumes
and
preferences
and
antipathies
such
was
what
i
knew
of
existence
and
now
i
felt
that
it
was
not
enough
i
tired
of
the
routine
of
eight
years
in
one
afternoon
i
desired
liberty
for
liberty
i
gasped
for
liberty
i
uttered
a
prayer
it
seemed
scattered
on
the
wind
then
faintly
blowing
i
abandoned
it
and
framed
a
humbler
supplication
for
change
stimulus
that
petition
too
seemed
swept
off
into
vague
space
then
i
cried
half
desperate
grant
me
at
least
a
new
servitude
here
a
bell
ringing
the
hour
of
supper
called
me
downstairs
i
was
not
free
to
resume
the
interrupted
chain
of
my
reflections
till
bedtime
even
then
a
teacher
who
occupied
the
same
room
with
me
kept
me
from
the
subject
to
which
i
longed
to
recur
by
a
prolonged
effusion
of
small
talk
how
i
wished
sleep
would
silence
her
it
seemed
as
if
could
i
but
go
back
to
the
idea
which
had
last
entered
my
mind
as
i
stood
at
the
window
some
inventive
suggestion
would
rise
for
my
relief
miss
gryce
snored
at
last
she
was
a
heavy
welshwoman
and
till
now
her
habitual
nasal
strains
had
never
been
regarded
by
me
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
nuisance
to
night
i
hailed
the
first
deep
notes
with
satisfaction
i
was
debarrassed
of
interruption
my
half
effaced
thought
instantly
revived
a
new
servitude
there
is
something
in
that
i
soliloquised
mentally
be
it
understood
i
did
not
talk
aloud
i
know
there
is
because
it
does
not
sound
too
sweet
it
is
not
like
such
words
as
liberty
excitement
enjoyment
delightful
sounds
truly
but
no
more
than
sounds
for
me
and
so
hollow
and
fleeting
that
it
is
mere
waste
of
time
to
listen
to
them
but
servitude
that
must
be
matter
of
fact
any
one
may
serve
i
have
served
here
eight
years
now
all
i
want
is
to
serve
elsewhere
can
i
not
get
so
much
of
my
own
will
is
not
the
thing
feasible
yes
yes
the
end
is
not
so
difficult
if
i
had
only
a
brain
active
enough
to
ferret
out
the
means
of
attaining
it
i
sat
up
in
bed
by
way
of
arousing
this
said
brain
it
was
a
chilly
night
i
covered
my
shoulders
with
a
shawl
and
then
i
proceeded
to
think
again
with
all
my
might
what
do
i
want
a
new
place
in
a
new
house
amongst
new
faces
under
new
circumstances
i
want
this
because
it
is
of
no
use
wanting
anything
better
how
do
people
do
to
get
a
new
place
they
apply
to
friends
i
suppose
i
have
no
friends
there
are
many
others
who
have
no
friends
who
must
look
about
for
themselves
and
be
their
own
helpers
and
what
is
their
resource
i
could
not
tell
nothing
answered
me
i
then
ordered
my
brain
to
find
a
response
and
quickly
it
worked
and
worked
faster
i
felt
the
pulses
throb
in
my
head
and
temples
but
for
nearly
an
hour
it
worked
in
chaos
and
no
result
came
of
its
efforts
feverish
with
vain
labour
i
got
up
and
took
a
turn
in
the
room
undrew
the
curtain
noted
a
star
or
two
shivered
with
cold
and
again
crept
to
bed
a
kind
fairy
in
my
absence
had
surely
dropped
the
required
suggestion
on
my
pillow
for
as
i
lay
down
it
came
quietly
and
naturally
to
my
mind
those
who
want
situations
advertise
you
must
advertise
in
the
shire
herald
how
i
know
nothing
about
advertising
replies
rose
smooth
and
prompt
now
you
must
enclose
the
advertisement
and
the
money
to
pay
for
it
under
a
cover
directed
to
the
editor
of
the
herald
you
must
put
it
the
first
opportunity
you
have
into
the
post
at
lowton
answers
must
be
addressed
to
j
e
at
the
post
office
there
you
can
go
and
inquire
in
about
a
week
after
you
send
your
letter
if
any
are
come
and
act
accordingly
this
scheme
i
went
over
twice
thrice
it
was
then
digested
in
my
mind
i
had
it
in
a
clear
practical
form
i
felt
satisfied
and
fell
asleep
with
earliest
day
i
was
up
i
had
my
advertisement
written
enclosed
and
directed
before
the
bell
rang
to
rouse
the
school
it
ran
thus
a
young
lady
accustomed
to
tuition
had
i
not
been
a
teacher
two
years
is
desirous
of
meeting
with
a
situation
in
a
private
family
where
the
children
are
under
fourteen
i
thought
that
as
i
was
barely
eighteen
it
would
not
do
to
undertake
the
guidance
of
pupils
nearer
my
own
age
she
is
qualified
to
teach
the
usual
branches
of
a
good
english
education
together
with
french
drawing
and
music
in
those
days
reader

now
narrow

of
accomplishments

have
been

comprehensive
address
j
e
post
office
lowton
shire
this
document
remained
locked
in
my
drawer
all
day
after
tea
i
asked
leave
of
the
new
superintendent
to
go
to
lowton
in
order
to
perform
some
small
commissions
for
myself
and
one
or
two
of
my
fellow
teachers
permission
was
readily
granted
i
went
it
was
a
walk
of
two
miles
and
the
evening
was
wet
but
the
days
were
still
long
i
visited
a
shop
or
two
slipped
the
letter
into
the
post
office
and
came
back
through
heavy
rain
with
streaming
garments
but
with
a
relieved
heart
the
succeeding
week
seemed
long
it
came
to
an
end
at
last
however
like
all
sublunary
things
and
once
more
towards
the
close
of
a
pleasant
autumn
day
i
found
myself
afoot
on
the
road
to
lowton
a
picturesque
track
it
was
by
the
way
lying
along
the
side
of
the
beck
and
through
the
sweetest
curves
of
the
dale
but
that
day
i
thought
more
of
the
letters
that
might
or
might
not
be
awaiting
me
at
the
little
burgh
whither
i
was
bound
than
of
the
charms
of
lea
and
water
my
ostensible
errand
on
this
occasion
was
to
get
measured
for
a
pair
of
shoes
so
i
discharged
that
business
first
and
when
it
was
done
i
stepped
across
the
clean
and
quiet
little
street
from
the
shoemaker
s
to
the
post
office
it
was
kept
by
an
old
dame
who
wore
horn
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
black
mittens
on
her
hands
are
there
any
letters
for
j
e
i
asked
she
peered
at
me
over
her
spectacles
and
then
she
opened
a
drawer
and
fumbled
among
its
contents
for
a
long
time
so
long
that
my
hopes
began
to
falter
at
last
having
held
a
document
before
her
glasses
for
nearly
five
minutes
she
presented
it
across
the
counter
accompanying
the
act
by
another
inquisitive
and
mistrustful
glance
it
was
for
j
e
is
there
only
one
i
demanded
there
are
no
more
said
she
and
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
turned
my
face
homeward
i
could
not
open
it
then
rules
obliged
me
to
be
back
by
eight
and
it
was
already
half
past
seven
various
duties
awaited
me
on
my
arrival
i
had
to
sit
with
the
girls
during
their
hour
of
study
then
it
was
my
turn
to
read
prayers
to
see
them
to
bed
afterwards
i
supped
with
the
other
teachers
even
when
we
finally
retired
for
the
night
the
inevitable
miss
gryce
was
still
my
companion
we
had
only
a
short
end
of
candle
in
our
candlestick
and
i
dreaded
lest
she
should
talk
till
it
was
all
burnt
out
fortunately
however
the
heavy
supper
she
had
eaten
produced
a
soporific
effect
she
was
already
snoring
before
i
had
finished
undressing
there
still
remained
an
inch
of
candle
i
now
took
out
my
letter
the
seal
was
an
initial
f
i
broke
it
the
contents
were
brief
if
j
e
who
advertised
in
the
shire
herald
of
last
thursday
possesses
the
acquirements
mentioned
and
if
she
is
in
a
position
to
give
satisfactory
references
as
to
character
and
competency
a
situation
can
be
offered
her
where
there
is
but
one
pupil
a
little
girl
under
ten
years
of
age
and
where
the
salary
is
thirty
pounds
per
annum
j
e
is
requested
to
send
references
name
address
and
all
particulars
to
the
direction
mrs
fairfax
thornfield
near
millcote
shire
i
examined
the
document
long
the
writing
was
old
fashioned
and
rather
uncertain
like
that
of
an
elderly
lady
this
circumstance
was
satisfactory
a
private
fear
had
haunted
me
that
in
thus
acting
for
myself
and
by
my
own
guidance
i
ran
the
risk
of
getting
into
some
scrape
and
above
all
things
i
wished
the
result
of
my
endeavours
to
be
respectable
proper
en
regle
i
now
felt
that
an
elderly
lady
was
no
bad
ingredient
in
the
business
i
had
on
hand
mrs
fairfax
i
saw
her
in
a
black
gown
and
widow
s
cap
frigid
perhaps
but
not
uncivil
a
model
of
elderly
english
respectability
thornfield
that
doubtless
was
the
name
of
her
house
a
neat
orderly
spot
i
was
sure
though
i
failed
in
my
efforts
to
conceive
a
correct
plan
of
the
premises
millcote
shire
i
brushed
up
my
recollections
of
the
map
of
england
yes
i
saw
it
both
the
shire
and
the
town
shire
was
seventy
miles
nearer
london
than
the
remote
county
where
i
now
resided
that
was
a
recommendation
to
me
i
longed
to
go
where
there
was
life
and
movement
millcote
was
a
large
manufacturing
town
on
the
banks
of
the
a
a
busy
place
enough
doubtless
so
much
the
better
it
would
be
a
complete
change
at
least
not
that
my
fancy
was
much
captivated
by
the
idea
of
long
chimneys
and
clouds
of
smoke
but
i
argued
thornfield
will
probably
be
a
good
way
from
the
town
here
the
socket
of
the
candle
dropped
and
the
wick
went
out
next
day
new
steps
were
to
be
taken
my
plans
could
no
longer
be
confined
to
my
own
breast
i
must
impart
them
in
order
to
achieve
their
success
having
sought
and
obtained
an
audience
of
the
superintendent
during
the
noontide
recreation
i
told
her
i
had
a
prospect
of
getting
a
new
situation
where
the
salary
would
be
double
what
i
now
received
for
at
lowood
i
only
got
15
pounds
per
annum
and
requested
she
would
break
the
matter
for
me
to
mr
brocklehurst
or
some
of
the
committee
and
ascertain
whether
they
would
permit
me
to
mention
them
as
references
she
obligingly
consented
to
act
as
mediatrix
in
the
matter
the
next
day
she
laid
the
affair
before
mr
brocklehurst
who
said
that
mrs
reed
must
be
written
to
as
she
was
my
natural
guardian
a
note
was
accordingly
addressed
to
that
lady
who
returned
for
answer
that
i
might
do
as
i
pleased
she
had
long
relinquished
all
interference
in
my
affairs
this
note
went
the
round
of
the
committee
and
at
last
after
what
appeared
to
me
most
tedious
delay
formal
leave
was
given
me
to
better
my
condition
if
i
could
and
an
assurance
added
that
as
i
had
always
conducted
myself
well
both
as
teacher
and
pupil
at
lowood
a
testimonial
of
character
and
capacity
signed
by
the
inspectors
of
that
institution
should
forthwith
be
furnished
me
this
testimonial
i
accordingly
received
in
about
a
month
forwarded
a
copy
of
it
to
mrs
fairfax
and
got
that
lady
s
reply
stating
that
she
was
satisfied
and
fixing
that
day
fortnight
as
the
period
for
my
assuming
the
post
of
governess
in
her
house
i
now
busied
myself
in
preparations
the
fortnight
passed
rapidly
i
had
not
a
very
large
wardrobe
though
it
was
adequate
to
my
wants
and
the
last
day
sufficed
to
pack
my
trunk
the
same
i
had
brought
with
me
eight
years
ago
from
gateshead
the
box
was
corded
the
card
nailed
on
in
half
an
hour
the
carrier
was
to
call
for
it
to
take
it
to
lowton
whither
i
myself
was
to
repair
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
to
meet
the
coach
i
had
brushed
my
black
stuff
travelling
dress
prepared
my
bonnet
gloves
and
muff
sought
in
all
my
drawers
to
see
that
no
article
was
left
behind
and
now
having
nothing
more
to
do
i
sat
down
and
tried
to
rest
i
could
not
though
i
had
been
on
foot
all
day
i
could
not
now
repose
an
instant
i
was
too
much
excited
a
phase
of
my
life
was
closing
to
night
a
new
one
opening
to
morrow
impossible
to
slumber
in
the
interval
i
must
watch
feverishly
while
the
change
was
being
accomplished
miss
said
a
servant
who
met
me
in
the
lobby
where
i
was
wandering
like
a
troubled
spirit
a
person
below
wishes
to
see
you
the
carrier
no
doubt
i
thought
and
ran
downstairs
without
inquiry
i
was
passing
the
back
parlour
or
teachers
sitting
room
the
door
of
which
was
half
open
to
go
to
the
kitchen
when
some
one
ran
out
it
s
her
i
am
sure
i
could
have
told
her
anywhere
cried
the
individual
who
stopped
my
progress
and
took
my
hand
i
looked
i
saw
a
woman
attired
like
a
well
dressed
servant
matronly
yet
still
young
very
good
looking
with
black
hair
and
eyes
and
lively
complexion
well
who
is
it
she
asked
in
a
voice
and
with
a
smile
i
half
recognised
you
ve
not
quite
forgotten
me
i
think
miss
jane
in
another
second
i
was
embracing
and
kissing
her
rapturously
bessie
bessie
bessie
that
was
all
i
said
whereat
she
half
laughed
half
cried
and
we
both
went
into
the
parlour
by
the
fire
stood
a
little
fellow
of
three
years
old
in
plaid
frock
and
trousers
that
is
my
little
boy
said
bessie
directly
then
you
are
married
bessie
yes
nearly
five
years
since
to
robert
leaven
the
coachman
and
i
ve
a
little
girl
besides
bobby
there
that
i
ve
christened
jane
and
you
don
t
live
at
gateshead
i
live
at
the
lodge
the
old
porter
has
left
well
and
how
do
they
all
get
on
tell
me
everything
about
them
bessie
but
sit
down
first
and
bobby
come
and
sit
on
my
knee
will
you
but
bobby
preferred
sidling
over
to
his
mother
you
re
not
grown
so
very
tall
miss
jane
nor
so
very
stout
continued
mrs
leaven
i
dare
say
they
ve
not
kept
you
too
well
at
school
miss
reed
is
the
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
you
are
and
miss
georgiana
would
make
two
of
you
in
breadth
georgiana
is
handsome
i
suppose
bessie
very
she
went
up
to
london
last
winter
with
her
mama
and
there
everybody
admired
her
and
a
young
lord
fell
in
love
with
her
but
his
relations
were
against
the
match
and
what
do
you
think
he
and
miss
georgiana
made
it
up
to
run
away
but
they
were
found
out
and
stopped
it
was
miss
reed
that
found
them
out
i
believe
she
was
envious
and
now
she
and
her
sister
lead
a
cat
and
dog
life
together
they
are
always
quarrelling
well
and
what
of
john
reed
oh
he
is
not
doing
so
well
as
his
mama
could
wish
he
went
to
college
and
he
got
plucked
i
think
they
call
it
and
then
his
uncles
wanted
him
to
be
a
barrister
and
study
the
law
but
he
is
such
a
dissipated
young
man
they
will
never
make
much
of
him
i
think
what
does
he
look
like
he
is
very
tall
some
people
call
him
a
fine
looking
young
man
but
he
has
such
thick
lips
and
mrs
reed
missis
looks
stout
and
well
enough
in
the
face
but
i
think
she
s
not
quite
easy
in
her
mind
mr
john
s
conduct
does
not
please
her
he
spends
a
deal
of
money
did
she
send
you
here
bessie
no
indeed
but
i
have
long
wanted
to
see
you
and
when
i
heard
that
there
had
been
a
letter
from
you
and
that
you
were
going
to
another
part
of
the
country
i
thought
i
d
just
set
off
and
get
a
look
at
you
before
you
were
quite
out
of
my
reach
i
am
afraid
you
are
disappointed
in
me
bessie
i
said
this
laughing
i
perceived
that
bessie
s
glance
though
it
expressed
regard
did
in
no
shape
denote
admiration
no
miss
jane
not
exactly
you
are
genteel
enough
you
look
like
a
lady
and
it
is
as
much
as
ever
i
expected
of
you
you
were
no
beauty
as
a
child
i
smiled
at
bessie
s
frank
answer
i
felt
that
it
was
correct
but
i
confess
i
was
not
quite
indifferent
to
its
import
at
eighteen
most
people
wish
to
please
and
the
conviction
that
they
have
not
an
exterior
likely
to
second
that
desire
brings
anything
but
gratification
i
dare
say
you
are
clever
though
continued
bessie
by
way
of
solace
what
can
you
do
can
you
play
on
the
piano
a
little
there
was
one
in
the
room
bessie
went
and
opened
it
and
then
asked
me
to
sit
down
and
give
her
a
tune
i
played
a
waltz
or
two
and
she
was
charmed
the
miss
reeds
could
not
play
as
well
said
she
exultingly
i
always
said
you
would
surpass
them
in
learning
and
can
you
draw
that
is
one
of
my
paintings
over
the
chimney
piece
it
was
a
landscape
in
water
colours
of
which
i
had
made
a
present
to
the
superintendent
in
acknowledgment
of
her
obliging
mediation
with
the
committee
on
my
behalf
and
which
she
had
framed
and
glazed
well
that
is
beautiful
miss
jane
it
is
as
fine
a
picture
as
any
miss
reed
s
drawing
master
could
paint
let
alone
the
young
ladies
themselves
who
could
not
come
near
it
and
have
you
learnt
french
yes
bessie
i
can
both
read
it
and
speak
it
and
you
can
work
on
muslin
and
canvas
i
can
oh
you
are
quite
a
lady
miss
jane
i
knew
you
would
be
you
will
get
on
whether
your
relations
notice
you
or
not
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
ask
you
have
you
ever
heard
anything
from
your
father
s
kinsfolk
the
eyres
never
in
my
life
well
you
know
missis
always
said
they
were
poor
and
quite
despicable
and
they
may
be
poor
but
i
believe
they
are
as
much
gentry
as
the
reeds
are
for
one
day
nearly
seven
years
ago
a
mr
eyre
came
to
gateshead
and
wanted
to
see
you
missis
said
you
were
at
school
fifty
miles
off
he
seemed
so
much
disappointed
for
he
could
not
stay
he
was
going
on
a
voyage
to
a
foreign
country
and
the
ship
was
to
sail
from
london
in
a
day
or
two
he
looked
quite
a
gentleman
and
i
believe
he
was
your
father
s
brother
what
foreign
country
was
he
going
to
bessie
an
island
thousands
of
miles
off
where
they
make
wine
the
butler
did
tell
me
madeira
i
suggested
yes
that
is
it
that
is
the
very
word
so
he
went
yes
he
did
not
stay
many
minutes
in
the
house
missis
was
very
high
with
him
she
called
him
afterwards
a
sneaking
tradesman
my
robert
believes
he
was
a
wine
merchant
very
likely
i
returned
or
perhaps
clerk
or
agent
to
a
wine
merchant
bessie
and
i
conversed
about
old
times
an
hour
longer
and
then
she
was
obliged
to
leave
me
i
saw
her
again
for
a
few
minutes
the
next
morning
at
lowton
while
i
was
waiting
for
the
coach
we
parted
finally
at
the
door
of
the
brocklehurst
arms
there
each
went
her
separate
way
she
set
off
for
the
brow
of
lowood
fell
to
meet
the
conveyance
which
was
to
take
her
back
to
gateshead
i
mounted
the
vehicle
which
was
to
bear
me
to
new
duties
and
a
new
life
in
the
unknown
environs
of
millcote
chapter
xi
a
new
chapter
in
a
novel
is
something
like
a
new
scene
in
a
play
and
when
i
draw
up
the
curtain
this
time
reader
you
must
fancy
you
see
a
room
in
the
george
inn
at
millcote
with
such
large
figured
papering
on
the
walls
as
inn
rooms
have
such
a
carpet
such
furniture
such
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
such
prints
including
a
portrait
of
george
the
third
and
another
of
the
prince
of
wales
and
a
representation
of
the
death
of
wolfe
all
this
is
visible
to
you
by
the
light
of
an
oil
lamp
hanging
from
the
ceiling
and
by
that
of
an
excellent
fire
near
which
i
sit
in
my
cloak
and
bonnet
my
muff
and
umbrella
lie
on
the
table
and
i
am
warming
away
the
numbness
and
chill
contracted
by
sixteen
hours
exposure
to
the
rawness
of
an
october
day
i
left
lowton
at
four
o
clock
a
m
and
the
millcote
town
clock
is
now
just
striking
eight
reader
though
i
look
comfortably
accommodated
i
am
not
very
tranquil
in
my
mind
i
thought
when
the
coach
stopped
here
there
would
be
some
one
to
meet
me
i
looked
anxiously
round
as
i
descended
the
wooden
steps
the
boots
placed
for
my
convenience
expecting
to
hear
my
name
pronounced
and
to
see
some
description
of
carriage
waiting
to
convey
me
to
thornfield
nothing
of
the
sort
was
visible
and
when
i
asked
a
waiter
if
any
one
had
been
to
inquire
after
a
miss
eyre
i
was
answered
in
the
negative
so
i
had
no
resource
but
to
request
to
be
shown
into
a
private
room
and
here
i
am
waiting
while
all
sorts
of
doubts
and
fears
are
troubling
my
thoughts
it
is
a
very
strange
sensation
to
inexperienced
youth
to
feel
itself
quite
alone
in
the
world
cut
adrift
from
every
connection
uncertain
whether
the
port
to
which
it
is
bound
can
be
reached
and
prevented
by
many
impediments
from
returning
to
that
it
has
quitted
the
charm
of
adventure
sweetens
that
sensation
the
glow
of
pride
warms
it
but
then
the
throb
of
fear
disturbs
it
and
fear
with
me
became
predominant
when
half
an
hour
elapsed
and
still
i
was
alone
i
bethought
myself
to
ring
the
bell
is
there
a
place
in
this
neighbourhood
called
thornfield
i
asked
of
the
waiter
who
answered
the
summons
thornfield
i
don
t
know
ma
am
i
ll
inquire
at
the
bar
he
vanished
but
reappeared
instantly
is
your
name
eyre
miss
yes
person
here
waiting
for
you
i
jumped
up
took
my
muff
and
umbrella
and
hastened
into
the
inn
passage
a
man
was
standing
by
the
open
door
and
in
the
lamp
lit
street
i
dimly
saw
a
one
horse
conveyance
this
will
be
your
luggage
i
suppose
said
the
man
rather
abruptly
when
he
saw
me
pointing
to
my
trunk
in
the
passage
yes
he
hoisted
it
on
to
the
vehicle
which
was
a
sort
of
car
and
then
i
got
in
before
he
shut
me
up
i
asked
him
how
far
it
was
to
thornfield
a
matter
of
six
miles
how
long
shall
we
be
before
we
get
there
happen
an
hour
and
a
half
he
fastened
the
car
door
climbed
to
his
own
seat
outside
and
we
set
off
our
progress
was
leisurely
and
gave
me
ample
time
to
reflect
i
was
content
to
be
at
length
so
near
the
end
of
my
journey
and
as
i
leaned
back
in
the
comfortable
though
not
elegant
conveyance
i
meditated
much
at
my
ease
i
suppose
thought
i
judging
from
the
plainness
of
the
servant
and
carriage
mrs
fairfax
is
not
a
very
dashing
person
so
much
the
better
i
never
lived
amongst
fine
people
but
once
and
i
was
very
miserable
with
them
i
wonder
if
she
lives
alone
except
this
little
girl
if
so
and
if
she
is
in
any
degree
amiable
i
shall
surely
be
able
to
get
on
with
her
i
will
do
my
best
it
is
a
pity
that
doing
one
s
best
does
not
always
answer
at
lowood
indeed
i
took
that
resolution
kept
it
and
succeeded
in
pleasing
but
with
mrs
reed
i
remember
my
best
was
always
spurned
with
scorn
i
pray
god
mrs
fairfax
may
not
turn
out
a
second
mrs
reed
but
if
she
does
i
am
not
bound
to
stay
with
her
let
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
i
can
advertise
again
how
far
are
we
on
our
road
now
i
wonder
i
let
down
the
window
and
looked
out
millcote
was
behind
us
judging
by
the
number
of
its
lights
it
seemed
a
place
of
considerable
magnitude
much
larger
than
lowton
we
were
now
as
far
as
i
could
see
on
a
sort
of
common
but
there
were
houses
scattered
all
over
the
district
i
felt
we
were
in
a
different
region
to
lowood
more
populous
less
picturesque
more
stirring
less
romantic
the
roads
were
heavy
the
night
misty
my
conductor
let
his
horse
walk
all
the
way
and
the
hour
and
a
half
extended
i
verily
believe
to
two
hours
at
last
he
turned
in
his
seat
and
said
you
re
noan
so
far
fro
thornfield
now
again
i
looked
out
we
were
passing
a
church
i
saw
its
low
broad
tower
against
the
sky
and
its
bell
was
tolling
a
quarter
i
saw
a
narrow
galaxy
of
lights
too
on
a
hillside
marking
a
village
or
hamlet
about
ten
minutes
after
the
driver
got
down
and
opened
a
pair
of
gates
we
passed
through
and
they
clashed
to
behind
us
we
now
slowly
ascended
a
drive
and
came
upon
the
long
front
of
a
house
candlelight
gleamed
from
one
curtained
bow
window
all
the
rest
were
dark
the
car
stopped
at
the
front
door
it
was
opened
by
a
maid
servant
i
alighted
and
went
in
will
you
walk
this
way
ma
am
said
the
girl
and
i
followed
her
across
a
square
hall
with
high
doors
all
round
she
ushered
me
into
a
room
whose
double
illumination
of
fire
and
candle
at
first
dazzled
me
contrasting
as
it
did
with
the
darkness
to
which
my
eyes
had
been
for
two
hours
inured
when
i
could
see
however
a
cosy
and
agreeable
picture
presented
itself
to
my
view
a
snug
small
room
a
round
table
by
a
cheerful
fire
an
arm
chair
high
backed
and
old
fashioned
wherein
sat
the
neatest
imaginable
little
elderly
lady
in
widow
s
cap
black
silk
gown
and
snowy
muslin
apron
exactly
like
what
i
had
fancied
mrs
fairfax
only
less
stately
and
milder
looking
she
was
occupied
in
knitting
a
large
cat
sat
demurely
at
her
feet
nothing
in
short
was
wanting
to
complete
the
beau
ideal
of
domestic
comfort
a
more
reassuring
introduction
for
a
new
governess
could
scarcely
be
conceived
there
was
no
grandeur
to
overwhelm
no
stateliness
to
embarrass
and
then
as
i
entered
the
old
lady
got
up
and
promptly
and
kindly
came
forward
to
meet
me
how
do
you
do
my
dear
i
am
afraid
you
have
had
a
tedious
ride
john
drives
so
slowly
you
must
be
cold
come
to
the
fire
mrs
fairfax
i
suppose
said
i
yes
you
are
right
do
sit
down
she
conducted
me
to
her
own
chair
and
then
began
to
remove
my
shawl
and
untie
my
bonnet
strings
i
begged
she
would
not
give
herself
so
much
trouble
oh
it
is
no
trouble
i
dare
say
your
own
hands
are
almost
numbed
with
cold
leah
make
a
little
hot
negus
and
cut
a
sandwich
or
two
here
are
the
keys
of
the
storeroom
and
she
produced
from
her
pocket
a
most
housewifely
bunch
of
keys
and
delivered
them
to
the
servant
now
then
draw
nearer
to
the
fire
she
continued
you
ve
brought
your
luggage
with
you
haven
t
you
my
dear
yes
ma
am
i
ll
see
it
carried
into
your
room
she
said
and
bustled
out
she
treats
me
like
a
visitor
thought
i
i
little
expected
such
a
reception
i
anticipated
only
coldness
and
stiffness
this
is
not
like
what
i
have
heard
of
the
treatment
of
governesses
but
i
must
not
exult
too
soon
she
returned
with
her
own
hands
cleared
her
knitting
apparatus
and
a
book
or
two
from
the
table
to
make
room
for
the
tray
which
leah
now
brought
and
then
herself
handed
me
the
refreshments
i
felt
rather
confused
at
being
the
object
of
more
attention
than
i
had
ever
before
received
and
that
too
shown
by
my
employer
and
superior
but
as
she
did
not
herself
seem
to
consider
she
was
doing
anything
out
of
her
place
i
thought
it
better
to
take
her
civilities
quietly
shall
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
miss
fairfax
to
night
i
asked
when
i
had
partaken
of
what
she
offered
me
what
did
you
say
my
dear
i
am
a
little
deaf
returned
the
good
lady
approaching
her
ear
to
my
mouth
i
repeated
the
question
more
distinctly
miss
fairfax
oh
you
mean
miss
varens
varens
is
the
name
of
your
future
pupil
indeed
then
she
is
not
your
daughter
no
i
have
no
family
i
should
have
followed
up
my
first
inquiry
by
asking
in
what
way
miss
varens
was
connected
with
her
but
i
recollected
it
was
not
polite
to
ask
too
many
questions
besides
i
was
sure
to
hear
in
time
i
am
so
glad
she
continued
as
she
sat
down
opposite
to
me
and
took
the
cat
on
her
knee
i
am
so
glad
you
are
come
it
will
be
quite
pleasant
living
here
now
with
a
companion
to
be
sure
it
is
pleasant
at
any
time
for
thornfield
is
a
fine
old
hall
rather
neglected
of
late
years
perhaps
but
still
it
is
a
respectable
place
yet
you
know
in
winter
time
one
feels
dreary
quite
alone
in
the
best
quarters
i
say
alone
leah
is
a
nice
girl
to
be
sure
and
john
and
his
wife
are
very
decent
people
but
then
you
see
they
are
only
servants
and
one
can
t
converse
with
them
on
terms
of
equality
one
must
keep
them
at
due
distance
for
fear
of
losing
one
s
authority
i
m
sure
last
winter
it
was
a
very
severe
one
if
you
recollect
and
when
it
did
not
snow
it
rained
and
blew
not
a
creature
but
the
butcher
and
postman
came
to
the
house
from
november
till
february
and
i
really
got
quite
melancholy
with
sitting
night
after
night
alone
i
had
leah
in
to
read
to
me
sometimes
but
i
don
t
think
the
poor
girl
liked
the
task
much
she
felt
it
confining
in
spring
and
summer
one
got
on
better
sunshine
and
long
days
make
such
a
difference
and
then
just
at
the
commencement
of
this
autumn
little
adela
varens
came
and
her
nurse
a
child
makes
a
house
alive
all
at
once
and
now
you
are
here
i
shall
be
quite
gay
my
heart
really
warmed
to
the
worthy
lady
as
i
heard
her
talk
and
i
drew
my
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
and
expressed
my
sincere
wish
that
she
might
find
my
company
as
agreeable
as
she
anticipated
but
i
ll
not
keep
you
sitting
up
late
to
night
said
she
it
is
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
now
and
you
have
been
travelling
all
day
you
must
feel
tired
if
you
have
got
your
feet
well
warmed
i
ll
show
you
your
bedroom
i
ve
had
the
room
next
to
mine
prepared
for
you
it
is
only
a
small
apartment
but
i
thought
you
would
like
it
better
than
one
of
the
large
front
chambers
to
be
sure
they
have
finer
furniture
but
they
are
so
dreary
and
solitary
i
never
sleep
in
them
myself
i
thanked
her
for
her
considerate
choice
and
as
i
really
felt
fatigued
with
my
long
journey
expressed
my
readiness
to
retire
she
took
her
candle
and
i
followed
her
from
the
room
first
she
went
to
see
if
the
hall
door
was
fastened
having
taken
the
key
from
the
lock
she
led
the
way
upstairs
the
steps
and
banisters
were
of
oak
the
staircase
window
was
high
and
latticed
both
it
and
the
long
gallery
into
which
the
bedroom
doors
opened
looked
as
if
they
belonged
to
a
church
rather
than
a
house
a
very
chill
and
vault
like
air
pervaded
the
stairs
and
gallery
suggesting
cheerless
ideas
of
space
and
solitude
and
i
was
glad
when
finally
ushered
into
my
chamber
to
find
it
of
small
dimensions
and
furnished
in
ordinary
modern
style
when
mrs
fairfax
had
bidden
me
a
kind
good
night
and
i
had
fastened
my
door
gazed
leisurely
round
and
in
some
measure
effaced
the
eerie
impression
made
by
that
wide
hall
that
dark
and
spacious
staircase
and
that
long
cold
gallery
by
the
livelier
aspect
of
my
little
room
i
remembered
that
after
a
day
of
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
anxiety
i
was
now
at
last
in
safe
haven
the
impulse
of
gratitude
swelled
my
heart
and
i
knelt
down
at
the
bedside
and
offered
up
thanks
where
thanks
were
due
not
forgetting
ere
i
rose
to
implore
aid
on
my
further
path
and
the
power
of
meriting
the
kindness
which
seemed
so
frankly
offered
me
before
it
was
earned
my
couch
had
no
thorns
in
it
that
night
my
solitary
room
no
fears
at
once
weary
and
content
i
slept
soon
and
soundly
when
i
awoke
it
was
broad
day
the
chamber
looked
such
a
bright
little
place
to
me
as
the
sun
shone
in
between
the
gay
blue
chintz
window
curtains
showing
papered
walls
and
a
carpeted
floor
so
unlike
the
bare
planks
and
stained
plaster
of
lowood
that
my
spirits
rose
at
the
view
externals
have
a
great
effect
on
the
young
i
thought
that
a
fairer
era
of
life
was
beginning
for
me
one
that
was
to
have
its
flowers
and
pleasures
as
well
as
its
thorns
and
toils
my
faculties
roused
by
the
change
of
scene
the
new
field
offered
to
hope
seemed
all
astir
i
cannot
precisely
define
what
they
expected
but
it
was
something
pleasant
not
perhaps
that
day
or
that
month
but
at
an
indefinite
future
period
i
rose
i
dressed
myself
with
care
obliged
to
be
plain
for
i
had
no
article
of
attire
that
was
not
made
with
extreme
simplicity
i
was
still
by
nature
solicitous
to
be
neat
it
was
not
my
habit
to
be
disregardful
of
appearance
or
careless
of
the
impression
i
made
on
the
contrary
i
ever
wished
to
look
as
well
as
i
could
and
to
please
as
much
as
my
want
of
beauty
would
permit
i
sometimes
regretted
that
i
was
not
handsomer
i
sometimes
wished
to
have
rosy
cheeks
a
straight
nose
and
small
cherry
mouth
i
desired
to
be
tall
stately
and
finely
developed
in
figure
i
felt
it
a
misfortune
that
i
was
so
little
so
pale
and
had
features
so
irregular
and
so
marked
and
why
had
i
these
aspirations
and
these
regrets
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
i
could
not
then
distinctly
say
it
to
myself
yet
i
had
a
reason
and
a
logical
natural
reason
too
however
when
i
had
brushed
my
hair
very
smooth
and
put
on
my
black
frock
which
quakerlike
as
it
was
at
least
had
the
merit
of
fitting
to
a
nicety
and
adjusted
my
clean
white
tucker
i
thought
i
should
do
respectably
enough
to
appear
before
mrs
fairfax
and
that
my
new
pupil
would
not
at
least
recoil
from
me
with
antipathy
having
opened
my
chamber
window
and
seen
that
i
left
all
things
straight
and
neat
on
the
toilet
table
i
ventured
forth
traversing
the
long
and
matted
gallery
i
descended
the
slippery
steps
of
oak
then
i
gained
the
hall
i
halted
there
a
minute
i
looked
at
some
pictures
on
the
walls
one
i
remember
represented
a
grim
man
in
a
cuirass
and
one
a
lady
with
powdered
hair
and
a
pearl
necklace
at
a
bronze
lamp
pendent
from
the
ceiling
at
a
great
clock
whose
case
was
of
oak
curiously
carved
and
ebon
black
with
time
and
rubbing
everything
appeared
very
stately
and
imposing
to
me
but
then
i
was
so
little
accustomed
to
grandeur
the
hall
door
which
was
half
of
glass
stood
open
i
stepped
over
the
threshold
it
was
a
fine
autumn
morning
the
early
sun
shone
serenely
on
embrowned
groves
and
still
green
fields
advancing
on
to
the
lawn
i
looked
up
and
surveyed
the
front
of
the
mansion
it
was
three
storeys
high
of
proportions
not
vast
though
considerable
a
gentleman
s
manor
house
not
a
nobleman
s
seat
battlements
round
the
top
gave
it
a
picturesque
look
its
grey
front
stood
out
well
from
the
background
of
a
rookery
whose
cawing
tenants
were
now
on
the
wing
they
flew
over
the
lawn
and
grounds
to
alight
in
a
great
meadow
from
which
these
were
separated
by
a
sunk
fence
and
where
an
array
of
mighty
old
thorn
trees
strong
knotty
and
broad
as
oaks
at
once
explained
the
etymology
of
the
mansion
s
designation
farther
off
were
hills
not
so
lofty
as
those
round
lowood
nor
so
craggy
nor
so
like
barriers
of
separation
from
the
living
world
but
yet
quiet
and
lonely
hills
enough
and
seeming
to
embrace
thornfield
with
a
seclusion
i
had
not
expected
to
find
existent
so
near
the
stirring
locality
of
millcote
a
little
hamlet
whose
roofs
were
blent
with
trees
straggled
up
the
side
of
one
of
these
hills
the
church
of
the
district
stood
nearer
thornfield
its
old
tower
top
looked
over
a
knoll
between
the
house
and
gates
i
was
yet
enjoying
the
calm
prospect
and
pleasant
fresh
air
yet
listening
with
delight
to
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
yet
surveying
the
wide
hoary
front
of
the
hall
and
thinking
what
a
great
place
it
was
for
one
lonely
little
dame
like
mrs
fairfax
to
inhabit
when
that
lady
appeared
at
the
door
what
out
already
said
she
i
see
you
are
an
early
riser
i
went
up
to
her
and
was
received
with
an
affable
kiss
and
shake
of
the
hand
how
do
you
like
thornfield
she
asked
i
told
her
i
liked
it
very
much
yes
she
said
it
is
a
pretty
place
but
i
fear
it
will
be
getting
out
of
order
unless
mr
rochester
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
and
reside
here
permanently
or
at
least
visit
it
rather
oftener
great
houses
and
fine
grounds
require
the
presence
of
the
proprietor
mr
rochester
i
exclaimed
who
is
he
the
owner
of
thornfield
she
responded
quietly
did
you
not
know
he
was
called
rochester
of
course
i
did
not
i
had
never
heard
of
him
before
but
the
old
lady
seemed
to
regard
his
existence
as
a
universally
understood
fact
with
which
everybody
must
be
acquainted
by
instinct
i
thought
i
continued
thornfield
belonged
to
you
to
me
bless
you
child
what
an
idea
to
me
i
am
only
the
housekeeper
the
manager
to
be
sure
i
am
distantly
related
to
the
rochesters
by
the
mother
s
side
or
at
least
my
husband
was
he
was
a
clergyman
incumbent
of
hay
that
little
village
yonder
on
the
hill
and
that
church
near
the
gates
was
his
the
present
mr
rochester
s
mother
was
a
fairfax
and
second
cousin
to
my
husband
but
i
never
presume
on
the
connection
in
fact
it
is
nothing
to
me
i
consider
myself
quite
in
the
light
of
an
ordinary
housekeeper
my
employer
is
always
civil
and
i
expect
nothing
more
and
the
little
girl
my
pupil
she
is
mr
rochester
s
ward
he
commissioned
me
to
find
a
governess
for
her
he
intended
to
have
her
brought
up
in
shire
i
believe
here
she
comes
with
her
bonne
as
she
calls
her
nurse
the
enigma
then
was
explained
this
affable
and
kind
little
widow
was
no
great
dame
but
a
dependant
like
myself
i
did
not
like
her
the
worse
for
that
on
the
contrary
i
felt
better
pleased
than
ever
the
equality
between
her
and
me
was
real
not
the
mere
result
of
condescension
on
her
part
so
much
the
better
my
position
was
all
the
freer
as
i
was
meditating
on
this
discovery
a
little
girl
followed
by
her
attendant
came
running
up
the
lawn
i
looked
at
my
pupil
who
did
not
at
first
appear
to
notice
me
she
was
quite
a
child
perhaps
seven
or
eight
years
old
slightly
built
with
a
pale
small
featured
face
and
a
redundancy
of
hair
falling
in
curls
to
her
waist
good
morning
miss
adela
said
mrs
fairfax
come
and
speak
to
the
lady
who
is
to
teach
you
and
to
make
you
a
clever
woman
some
day
she
approached
c
est
la
ma
gouverante
said
she
pointing
to
me
and
addressing
her
nurse
who
answered
mais
oui
certainement
are
they
foreigners
i
inquired
amazed
at
hearing
the
french
language
the
nurse
is
a
foreigner
and
adela
was
born
on
the
continent
and
i
believe
never
left
it
till
within
six
months
ago
when
she
first
came
here
she
could
speak
no
english
now
she
can
make
shift
to
talk
it
a
little
i
don
t
understand
her
she
mixes
it
so
with
french
but
you
will
make
out
her
meaning
very
well
i
dare
say
fortunately
i
had
had
the
advantage
of
being
taught
french
by
a
french
lady
and
as
i
had
always
made
a
point
of
conversing
with
madame
pierrot
as
often
as
i
could
and
had
besides
during
the
last
seven
years
learnt
a
portion
of
french
by
heart
daily
applying
myself
to
take
pains
with
my
accent
and
imitating
as
closely
as
possible
the
pronunciation
of
my
teacher
i
had
acquired
a
certain
degree
of
readiness
and
correctness
in
the
language
and
was
not
likely
to
be
much
at
a
loss
with
mademoiselle
adela
she
came
and
shook
hand
with
me
when
she
heard
that
i
was
her
governess
and
as
i
led
her
in
to
breakfast
i
addressed
some
phrases
to
her
in
her
own
tongue
she
replied
briefly
at
first
but
after
we
were
seated
at
the
table
and
she
had
examined
me
some
ten
minutes
with
her
large
hazel
eyes
she
suddenly
commenced
chattering
fluently
ah
cried
she
in
french
you
speak
my
language
as
well
as
mr
rochester
does
i
can
talk
to
you
as
i
can
to
him
and
so
can
sophie
she
will
be
glad
nobody
here
understands
her
madame
fairfax
is
all
english
sophie
is
my
nurse
she
came
with
me
over
the
sea
in
a
great
ship
with
a
chimney
that
smoked
how
it
did
smoke
and
i
was
sick
and
so
was
sophie
and
so
was
mr
rochester
mr
rochester
lay
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
pretty
room
called
the
salon
and
sophie
and
i
had
little
beds
in
another
place
i
nearly
fell
out
of
mine
it
was
like
a
shelf
and
mademoiselle
what
is
your
name
eyre
jane
eyre
aire
bah
i
cannot
say
it
well
our
ship
stopped
in
the
morning
before
it
was
quite
daylight
at
a
great
city
a
huge
city
with
very
dark
houses
and
all
smoky
not
at
all
like
the
pretty
clean
town
i
came
from
and
mr
rochester
carried
me
in
his
arms
over
a
plank
to
the
land
and
sophie
came
after
and
we
all
got
into
a
coach
which
took
us
to
a
beautiful
large
house
larger
than
this
and
finer
called
an
hotel
we
stayed
there
nearly
a
week
i
and
sophie
used
to
walk
every
day
in
a
great
green
place
full
of
trees
called
the
park
and
there
were
many
children
there
besides
me
and
a
pond
with
beautiful
birds
in
it
that
i
fed
with
crumbs
can
you
understand
her
when
she
runs
on
so
fast
asked
mrs
fairfax
i
understood
her
very
well
for
i
had
been
accustomed
to
the
fluent
tongue
of
madame
pierrot
i
wish
continued
the
good
lady
you
would
ask
her
a
question
or
two
about
her
parents
i
wonder
if
she
remembers
them
adele
i
inquired
with
whom
did
you
live
when
you
were
in
that
pretty
clean
town
you
spoke
of
i
lived
long
ago
with
mama
but
she
is
gone
to
the
holy
virgin
mama
used
to
teach
me
to
dance
and
sing
and
to
say
verses
a
great
many
gentlemen
and
ladies
came
to
see
mama
and
i
used
to
dance
before
them
or
to
sit
on
their
knees
and
sing
to
them
i
liked
it
shall
i
let
you
hear
me
sing
now
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
so
i
permitted
her
to
give
a
specimen
of
her
accomplishments
descending
from
her
chair
she
came
and
placed
herself
on
my
knee
then
folding
her
little
hands
demurely
before
her
shaking
back
her
curls
and
lifting
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
she
commenced
singing
a
song
from
some
opera
it
was
the
strain
of
a
forsaken
lady
who
after
bewailing
the
perfidy
of
her
lover
calls
pride
to
her
aid
desires
her
attendant
to
deck
her
in
her
brightest
jewels
and
richest
robes
and
resolves
to
meet
the
false
one
that
night
at
a
ball
and
prove
to
him
by
the
gaiety
of
her
demeanour
how
little
his
desertion
has
affected
her
the
subject
seemed
strangely
chosen
for
an
infant
singer
but
i
suppose
the
point
of
the
exhibition
lay
in
hearing
the
notes
of
love
and
jealousy
warbled
with
the
lisp
of
childhood
and
in
very
bad
taste
that
point
was
at
least
i
thought
so
adele
sang
the
canzonette
tunefully
enough
and
with
the
naivete
of
her
age
this
achieved
she
jumped
from
my
knee
and
said
now
mademoiselle
i
will
repeat
you
some
poetry
assuming
an
attitude
she
began
la
ligue
des
rats
fable
de
la
fontaine
she
then
declaimed
the
little
piece
with
an
attention
to
punctuation
and
emphasis
a
flexibility
of
voice
and
an
appropriateness
of
gesture
very
unusual
indeed
at
her
age
and
which
proved
she
had
been
carefully
trained
was
it
your
mama
who
taught
you
that
piece
i
asked
yes
and
she
just
used
to
say
it
in
this
way
qu
avez
vous
donc
lui
dit
un
de
ces
rats
parlez
she
made
me
lift
my
hand
so
to
remind
me
to
raise
my
voice
at
the
question
now
shall
i
dance
for
you
no
that
will
do
but
after
your
mama
went
to
the
holy
virgin
as
you
say
with
whom
did
you
live
then
with
madame
frederic
and
her
husband
she
took
care
of
me
but
she
is
nothing
related
to
me
i
think
she
is
poor
for
she
had
not
so
fine
a
house
as
mama
i
was
not
long
there
mr
rochester
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
go
and
live
with
him
in
england
and
i
said
yes
for
i
knew
mr
rochester
before
i
knew
madame
frederic
and
he
was
always
kind
to
me
and
gave
me
pretty
dresses
and
toys
but
you
see
he
has
not
kept
his
word
for
he
has
brought
me
to
england
and
now
he
is
gone
back
again
himself
and
i
never
see
him
after
breakfast
adele
and
i
withdrew
to
the
library
which
room
it
appears
mr
rochester
had
directed
should
be
used
as
the
schoolroom
most
of
the
books
were
locked
up
behind
glass
doors
but
there
was
one
bookcase
left
open
containing
everything
that
could
be
needed
in
the
way
of
elementary
works
and
several
volumes
of
light
literature
poetry
biography
travels
a
few
romances
c
i
suppose
he
had
considered
that
these
were
all
the
governess
would
require
for
her
private
perusal
and
indeed
they
contented
me
amply
for
the
present
compared
with
the
scanty
pickings
i
had
now
and
then
been
able
to
glean
at
lowood
they
seemed
to
offer
an
abundant
harvest
of
entertainment
and
information
in
this
room
too
there
was
a
cabinet
piano
quite
new
and
of
superior
tone
also
an
easel
for
painting
and
a
pair
of
globes
i
found
my
pupil
sufficiently
docile
though
disinclined
to
apply
she
had
not
been
used
to
regular
occupation
of
any
kind
i
felt
it
would
be
injudicious
to
confine
her
too
much
at
first
so
when
i
had
talked
to
her
a
great
deal
and
got
her
to
learn
a
little
and
when
the
morning
had
advanced
to
noon
i
allowed
her
to
return
to
her
nurse
i
then
proposed
to
occupy
myself
till
dinner
time
in
drawing
some
little
sketches
for
her
use
as
i
was
going
upstairs
to
fetch
my
portfolio
and
pencils
mrs
fairfax
called
to
me
your
morning
school
hours
are
over
now
i
suppose
said
she
she
was
in
a
room
the
folding
doors
of
which
stood
open
i
went
in
when
she
addressed
me
it
was
a
large
stately
apartment
with
purple
chairs
and
curtains
a
turkey
carpet
walnut
panelled
walls
one
vast
window
rich
in
slanted
glass
and
a
lofty
ceiling
nobly
moulded
mrs
fairfax
was
dusting
some
vases
of
fine
purple
spar
which
stood
on
a
sideboard
what
a
beautiful
room
i
exclaimed
as
i
looked
round
for
i
had
never
before
seen
any
half
so
imposing
yes
this
is
the
dining
room
i
have
just
opened
the
window
to
let
in
a
little
air
and
sunshine
for
everything
gets
so
damp
in
apartments
that
are
seldom
inhabited
the
drawing
room
yonder
feels
like
a
vault
she
pointed
to
a
wide
arch
corresponding
to
the
window
and
hung
like
it
with
a
tyrian
dyed
curtain
now
looped
up
mounting
to
it
by
two
broad
steps
and
looking
through
i
thought
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
fairy
place
so
bright
to
my
novice
eyes
appeared
the
view
beyond
yet
it
was
merely
a
very
pretty
drawing
room
and
within
it
a
boudoir
both
spread
with
white
carpets
on
which
seemed
laid
brilliant
garlands
of
flowers
both
ceiled
with
snowy
mouldings
of
white
grapes
and
vine
leaves
beneath
which
glowed
in
rich
contrast
crimson
couches
and
ottomans
while
the
ornaments
on
the
pale
parian
mantelpiece
were
of
sparkling
bohemian
glass
ruby
red
and
between
the
windows
large
mirrors
repeated
the
general
blending
of
snow
and
fire
in
what
order
you
keep
these
rooms
mrs
fairfax
said
i
no
dust
no
canvas
coverings
except
that
the
air
feels
chilly
one
would
think
they
were
inhabited
daily
why
miss
eyre
though
mr
rochester
s
visits
here
are
rare
they
are
always
sudden
and
unexpected
and
as
i
observed
that
it
put
him
out
to
find
everything
swathed
up
and
to
have
a
bustle
of
arrangement
on
his
arrival
i
thought
it
best
to
keep
the
rooms
in
readiness
is
mr
rochester
an
exacting
fastidious
sort
of
man
not
particularly
so
but
he
has
a
gentleman
s
tastes
and
habits
and
he
expects
to
have
things
managed
in
conformity
to
them
do
you
like
him
is
he
generally
liked
oh
yes
the
family
have
always
been
respected
here
almost
all
the
land
in
this
neighbourhood
as
far
as
you
can
see
has
belonged
to
the
rochesters
time
out
of
mind
well
but
leaving
his
land
out
of
the
question
do
you
like
him
is
he
liked
for
himself
i
have
no
cause
to
do
otherwise
than
like
him
and
i
believe
he
is
considered
a
just
and
liberal
landlord
by
his
tenants
but
he
has
never
lived
much
amongst
them
but
has
he
no
peculiarities
what
in
short
is
his
character
oh
his
character
is
unimpeachable
i
suppose
he
is
rather
peculiar
perhaps
he
has
travelled
a
great
deal
and
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
i
should
think
i
dare
say
he
is
clever
but
i
never
had
much
conversation
with
him
in
what
way
is
he
peculiar
i
don
t
know
it
is
not
easy
to
describe
nothing
striking
but
you
feel
it
when
he
speaks
to
you
you
cannot
be
always
sure
whether
he
is
in
jest
or
earnest
whether
he
is
pleased
or
the
contrary
you
don
t
thoroughly
understand
him
in
short
at
least
i
don
t
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
he
is
a
very
good
master
this
was
all
the
account
i
got
from
mrs
fairfax
of
her
employer
and
mine
there
are
people
who
seem
to
have
no
notion
of
sketching
a
character
or
observing
and
describing
salient
points
either
in
persons
or
things
the
good
lady
evidently
belonged
to
this
class
my
queries
puzzled
but
did
not
draw
her
out
mr
rochester
was
mr
rochester
in
her
eyes
a
gentleman
a
landed
proprietor
nothing
more
she
inquired
and
searched
no
further
and
evidently
wondered
at
my
wish
to
gain
a
more
definite
notion
of
his
identity
when
we
left
the
dining
room
she
proposed
to
show
me
over
the
rest
of
the
house
and
i
followed
her
upstairs
and
downstairs
admiring
as
i
went
for
all
was
well
arranged
and
handsome
the
large
front
chambers
i
thought
especially
grand
and
some
of
the
third
storey
rooms
though
dark
and
low
were
interesting
from
their
air
of
antiquity
the
furniture
once
appropriated
to
the
lower
apartments
had
from
time
to
time
been
removed
here
as
fashions
changed
and
the
imperfect
light
entering
by
their
narrow
casement
showed
bedsteads
of
a
hundred
years
old
chests
in
oak
or
walnut
looking
with
their
strange
carvings
of
palm
branches
and
cherubs
heads
like
types
of
the
hebrew
ark
rows
of
venerable
chairs
high
backed
and
narrow
stools
still
more
antiquated
on
whose
cushioned
tops
were
yet
apparent
traces
of
half
effaced
embroideries
wrought
by
fingers
that
for
two
generations
had
been
coffin
dust
all
these
relics
gave
to
the
third
storey
of
thornfield
hall
the
aspect
of
a
home
of
the
past
a
shrine
of
memory
i
liked
the
hush
the
gloom
the
quaintness
of
these
retreats
in
the
day
but
i
by
no
means
coveted
a
night
s
repose
on
one
of
those
wide
and
heavy
beds
shut
in
some
of
them
with
doors
of
oak
shaded
others
with
wrought
old
english
hangings
crusted
with
thick
work
portraying
effigies
of
strange
flowers
and
stranger
birds
and
strangest
human
beings
all
which
would
have
looked
strange
indeed
by
the
pallid
gleam
of
moonlight
do
the
servants
sleep
in
these
rooms
i
asked
no
they
occupy
a
range
of
smaller
apartments
to
the
back
no
one
ever
sleeps
here
one
would
almost
say
that
if
there
were
a
ghost
at
thornfield
hall
this
would
be
its
haunt
so
i
think
you
have
no
ghost
then
none
that
i
ever
heard
of
returned
mrs
fairfax
smiling
nor
any
traditions
of
one
no
legends
or
ghost
stories
i
believe
not
and
yet
it
is
said
the
rochesters
have
been
rather
a
violent
than
a
quiet
race
in
their
time
perhaps
though
that
is
the
reason
they
rest
tranquilly
in
their
graves
now
yes
after
life
s
fitful
fever
they
sleep
well
i
muttered
where
are
you
going
now
mrs
fairfax
for
she
was
moving
away
on
to
the
leads
will
you
come
and
see
the
view
from
thence
i
followed
still
up
a
very
narrow
staircase
to
the
attics
and
thence
by
a
ladder
and
through
a
trap
door
to
the
roof
of
the
hall
i
was
now
on
a
level
with
the
crow
colony
and
could
see
into
their
nests
leaning
over
the
battlements
and
looking
far
down
i
surveyed
the
grounds
laid
out
like
a
map
the
bright
and
velvet
lawn
closely
girdling
the
grey
base
of
the
mansion
the
field
wide
as
a
park
dotted
with
its
ancient
timber
the
wood
dun
and
sere
divided
by
a
path
visibly
overgrown
greener
with
moss
than
the
trees
were
with
foliage
the
church
at
the
gates
the
road
the
tranquil
hills
all
reposing
in
the
autumn
day
s
sun
the
horizon
bounded
by
a
propitious
sky
azure
marbled
with
pearly
white
no
feature
in
the
scene
was
extraordinary
but
all
was
pleasing
when
i
turned
from
it
and
repassed
the
trap
door
i
could
scarcely
see
my
way
down
the
ladder
the
attic
seemed
black
as
a
vault
compared
with
that
arch
of
blue
air
to
which
i
had
been
looking
up
and
to
that
sunlit
scene
of
grove
pasture
and
green
hill
of
which
the
hall
was
the
centre
and
over
which
i
had
been
gazing
with
delight
mrs
fairfax
stayed
behind
a
moment
to
fasten
the
trap
door
i
by
drift
of
groping
found
the
outlet
from
the
attic
and
proceeded
to
descend
the
narrow
garret
staircase
i
lingered
in
the
long
passage
to
which
this
led
separating
the
front
and
back
rooms
of
the
third
storey
narrow
low
and
dim
with
only
one
little
window
at
the
far
end
and
looking
with
its
two
rows
of
small
black
doors
all
shut
like
a
corridor
in
some
bluebeard
s
castle
while
i
paced
softly
on
the
last
sound
i
expected
to
hear
in
so
still
a
region
a
laugh
struck
my
ear
it
was
a
curious
laugh
distinct
formal
mirthless
i
stopped
the
sound
ceased
only
for
an
instant
it
began
again
louder
for
at
first
though
distinct
it
was
very
low
it
passed
off
in
a
clamorous
peal
that
seemed
to
wake
an
echo
in
every
lonely
chamber
though
it
originated
but
in
one
and
i
could
have
pointed
out
the
door
whence
the
accents
issued
mrs
fairfax
i
called
out
for
i
now
heard
her
descending
the
great
stairs
did
you
hear
that
loud
laugh
who
is
it
some
of
the
servants
very
likely
she
answered
perhaps
grace
poole
did
you
hear
it
i
again
inquired
yes
plainly
i
often
hear
her
she
sews
in
one
of
these
rooms
sometimes
leah
is
with
her
they
are
frequently
noisy
together
the
laugh
was
repeated
in
its
low
syllabic
tone
and
terminated
in
an
odd
murmur
grace
exclaimed
mrs
fairfax
i
really
did
not
expect
any
grace
to
answer
for
the
laugh
was
as
tragic
as
preternatural
a
laugh
as
any
i
ever
heard
and
but
that
it
was
high
noon
and
that
no
circumstance
of
ghostliness
accompanied
the
curious
cachinnation
but
that
neither
scene
nor
season
favoured
fear
i
should
have
been
superstitiously
afraid
however
the
event
showed
me
i
was
a
fool
for
entertaining
a
sense
even
of
surprise
the
door
nearest
me
opened
and
a
servant
came
out
a
woman
of
between
thirty
and
forty
a
set
square
made
figure
red
haired
and
with
a
hard
plain
face
any
apparition
less
romantic
or
less
ghostly
could
scarcely
be
conceived
too
much
noise
grace
said
mrs
fairfax
remember
directions
grace
curtseyed
silently
and
went
in
she
is
a
person
we
have
to
sew
and
assist
leah
in
her
housemaid
s
work
continued
the
widow
not
altogether
unobjectionable
in
some
points
but
she
does
well
enough
by
the
bye
how
have
you
got
on
with
your
new
pupil
this
morning
the
conversation
thus
turned
on
adele
continued
till
we
reached
the
light
and
cheerful
region
below
adele
came
running
to
meet
us
in
the
hall
exclaiming
mesdames
vous
etes

adding
j

we
found
dinner
ready
and
waiting
for
us
in
mrs
fairfax
s
room
chapter
xii
the
promise
of
a
smooth
career
which
my
first
calm
introduction
to
thornfield
hall
seemed
to
pledge
was
not
belied
on
a
longer
acquaintance
with
the
place
and
its
inmates
mrs
fairfax
turned
out
to
be
what
she
appeared
a
placid
tempered
kind
natured
woman
of
competent
education
and
average
intelligence
my
pupil
was
a
lively
child
who
had
been
spoilt
and
indulged
and
therefore
was
sometimes
wayward
but
as
she
was
committed
entirely
to
my
care
and
no
injudicious
interference
from
any
quarter
ever
thwarted
my
plans
for
her
improvement
she
soon
forgot
her
little
freaks
and
became
obedient
and
teachable
she
had
no
great
talents
no
marked
traits
of
character
no
peculiar
development
of
feeling
or
taste
which
raised
her
one
inch
above
the
ordinary
level
of
childhood
but
neither
had
she
any
deficiency
or
vice
which
sunk
her
below
it
she
made
reasonable
progress
entertained
for
me
a
vivacious
though
perhaps
not
very
profound
affection
and
by
her
simplicity
gay
prattle
and
efforts
to
please
inspired
me
in
return
with
a
degree
of
attachment
sufficient
to
make
us
both
content
in
each
other
s
society
this
par
parenthese
will
be
thought
cool
language
by
persons
who
entertain
solemn
doctrines
about
the
angelic
nature
of
children
and
the
duty
of
those
charged
with
their
education
to
conceive
for
them
an
idolatrous
devotion
but
i
am
not
writing
to
flatter
parental
egotism
to
echo
cant
or
prop
up
humbug
i
am
merely
telling
the
truth
i
felt
a
conscientious
solicitude
for
adele
s
welfare
and
progress
and
a
quiet
liking
for
her
little
self
just
as
i
cherished
towards
mrs
fairfax
a
thankfulness
for
her
kindness
and
a
pleasure
in
her
society
proportionate
to
the
tranquil
regard
she
had
for
me
and
the
moderation
of
her
mind
and
character
anybody
may
blame
me
who
likes
when
i
add
further
that
now
and
then
when
i
took
a
walk
by
myself
in
the
grounds
when
i
went
down
to
the
gates
and
looked
through
them
along
the
road
or
when
while
adele
played
with
her
nurse
and
mrs
fairfax
made
jellies
in
the
storeroom
i
climbed
the
three
staircases
raised
the
trap
door
of
the
attic
and
having
reached
the
leads
looked
out
afar
over
sequestered
field
and
hill
and
along
dim
sky
line
that
then
i
longed
for
a
power
of
vision
which
might
overpass
that
limit
which
might
reach
the
busy
world
towns
regions
full
of
life
i
had
heard
of
but
never
seen
that
then
i
desired
more
of
practical
experience
than
i
possessed
more
of
intercourse
with
my
kind
of
acquaintance
with
variety
of
character
than
was
here
within
my
reach
i
valued
what
was
good
in
mrs
fairfax
and
what
was
good
in
adele
but
i
believed
in
the
existence
of
other
and
more
vivid
kinds
of
goodness
and
what
i
believed
in
i
wished
to
behold
who
blames
me
many
no
doubt
and
i
shall
be
called
discontented
i
could
not
help
it
the
restlessness
was
in
my
nature
it
agitated
me
to
pain
sometimes
then
my
sole
relief
was
to
walk
along
the
corridor
of
the
third
storey
backwards
and
forwards
safe
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
spot
and
allow
my
mind
s
eye
to
dwell
on
whatever
bright
visions
rose
before
it
and
certainly
they
were
many
and
glowing
to
let
my
heart
be
heaved
by
the
exultant
movement
which
while
it
swelled
it
in
trouble
expanded
it
with
life
and
best
of
all
to
open
my
inward
ear
to
a
tale
that
was
never
ended
a
tale
my
imagination
created
and
narrated
continuously
quickened
with
all
of
incident
life
fire
feeling
that
i
desired
and
had
not
in
my
actual
existence
it
is
in
vain
to
say
human
beings
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
tranquillity
they
must
have
action
and
they
will
make
it
if
they
cannot
find
it
millions
are
condemned
to
a
stiller
doom
than
mine
and
millions
are
in
silent
revolt
against
their
lot
nobody
knows
how
many
rebellions
besides
political
rebellions
ferment
in
the
masses
of
life
which
people
earth
women
are
supposed
to
be
very
calm
generally
but
women
feel
just
as
men
feel
they
need
exercise
for
their
faculties
and
a
field
for
their
efforts
as
much
as
their
brothers
do
they
suffer
from
too
rigid
a
restraint
too
absolute
a
stagnation
precisely
as
men
would
suffer
and
it
is
narrow
minded
in
their
more
privileged
fellow
creatures
to
say
that
they
ought
to
confine
themselves
to
making
puddings
and
knitting
stockings
to
playing
on
the
piano
and
embroidering
bags
it
is
thoughtless
to
condemn
them
or
laugh
at
them
if
they
seek
to
do
more
or
learn
more
than
custom
has
pronounced
necessary
for
their
sex
when
thus
alone
i
not
unfrequently
heard
grace
poole
s
laugh
the
same
peal
the
same
low
slow
ha
ha
which
when
first
heard
had
thrilled
me
i
heard
too
her
eccentric
murmurs
stranger
than
her
laugh
there
were
days
when
she
was
quite
silent
but
there
were
others
when
i
could
not
account
for
the
sounds
she
made
sometimes
i
saw
her
she
would
come
out
of
her
room
with
a
basin
or
a
plate
or
a
tray
in
her
hand
go
down
to
the
kitchen
and
shortly
return
generally
oh
romantic
reader
forgive
me
for
telling
the
plain
truth
bearing
a
pot
of
porter
her
appearance
always
acted
as
a
damper
to
the
curiosity
raised
by
her
oral
oddities
hard
featured
and
staid
she
had
no
point
to
which
interest
could
attach
i
made
some
attempts
to
draw
her
into
conversation
but
she
seemed
a
person
of
few
words
a
monosyllabic
reply
usually
cut
short
every
effort
of
that
sort
the
other
members
of
the
household
viz
john
and
his
wife
leah
the
housemaid
and
sophie
the
french
nurse
were
decent
people
but
in
no
respect
remarkable
with
sophie
i
used
to
talk
french
and
sometimes
i
asked
her
questions
about
her
native
country
but
she
was
not
of
a
descriptive
or
narrative
turn
and
generally
gave
such
vapid
and
confused
answers
as
were
calculated
rather
to
check
than
encourage
inquiry
october
november
december
passed
away
one
afternoon
in
january
mrs
fairfax
had
begged
a
holiday
for
adele
because
she
had
a
cold
and
as
adele
seconded
the
request
with
an
ardour
that
reminded
me
how
precious
occasional
holidays
had
been
to
me
in
my
own
childhood
i
accorded
it
deeming
that
i
did
well
in
showing
pliability
on
the
point
it
was
a
fine
calm
day
though
very
cold
i
was
tired
of
sitting
still
in
the
library
through
a
whole
long
morning
mrs
fairfax
had
just
written
a
letter
which
was
waiting
to
be
posted
so
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
cloak
and
volunteered
to
carry
it
to
hay
the
distance
two
miles
would
be
a
pleasant
winter
afternoon
walk
having
seen
adele
comfortably
seated
in
her
little
chair
by
mrs
fairfax
s
parlour
fireside
and
given
her
her
best
wax
doll
which
i
usually
kept
enveloped
in
silver
paper
in
a
drawer
to
play
with
and
a
story
book
for
change
of
amusement
and
having
replied
to
her
revenez
bientot
ma
bonne
amie
ma
chere
mdlle
jeannette
with
a
kiss
i
set
out
the
ground
was
hard
the
air
was
still
my
road
was
lonely
i
walked
fast
till
i
got
warm
and
then
i
walked
slowly
to
enjoy
and
analyse
the
species
of
pleasure
brooding
for
me
in
the
hour
and
situation
it
was
three
o
clock
the
church
bell
tolled
as
i
passed
under
the
belfry
the
charm
of
the
hour
lay
in
its
approaching
dimness
in
the
low
gliding
and
pale
beaming
sun
i
was
a
mile
from
thornfield
in
a
lane
noted
for
wild
roses
in
summer
for
nuts
and
blackberries
in
autumn
and
even
now
possessing
a
few
coral
treasures
in
hips
and
haws
but
whose
best
winter
delight
lay
in
its
utter
solitude
and
leafless
repose
if
a
breath
of
air
stirred
it
made
no
sound
here
for
there
was
not
a
holly
not
an
evergreen
to
rustle
and
the
stripped
hawthorn
and
hazel
bushes
were
as
still
as
the
white
worn
stones
which
causewayed
the
middle
of
the
path
far
and
wide
on
each
side
there
were
only
fields
where
no
cattle
now
browsed
and
the
little
brown
birds
which
stirred
occasionally
in
the
hedge
looked
like
single
russet
leaves
that
had
forgotten
to
drop
this
lane
inclined
up
hill
all
the
way
to
hay
having
reached
the
middle
i
sat
down
on
a
stile
which
led
thence
into
a
field
gathering
my
mantle
about
me
and
sheltering
my
hands
in
my
muff
i
did
not
feel
the
cold
though
it
froze
keenly
as
was
attested
by
a
sheet
of
ice
covering
the
causeway
where
a
little
brooklet
now
congealed
had
overflowed
after
a
rapid
thaw
some
days
since
from
my
seat
i
could
look
down
on
thornfield
the
grey
and
battlemented
hall
was
the
principal
object
in
the
vale
below
me
its
woods
and
dark
rookery
rose
against
the
west
i
lingered
till
the
sun
went
down
amongst
the
trees
and
sank
crimson
and
clear
behind
them
i
then
turned
eastward
on
the
hill
top
above
me
sat
the
rising
moon
pale
yet
as
a
cloud
but
brightening
momentarily
she
looked
over
hay
which
half
lost
in
trees
sent
up
a
blue
smoke
from
its
few
chimneys
it
was
yet
a
mile
distant
but
in
the
absolute
hush
i
could
hear
plainly
its
thin
murmurs
of
life
my
ear
too
felt
the
flow
of
currents
in
what
dales
and
depths
i
could
not
tell
but
there
were
many
hills
beyond
hay
and
doubtless
many
becks
threading
their
passes
that
evening
calm
betrayed
alike
the
tinkle
of
the
nearest
streams
the
sough
of
the
most
remote
a
rude
noise
broke
on
these
fine
ripplings
and
whisperings
at
once
so
far
away
and
so
clear
a
positive
tramp
tramp
a
metallic
clatter
which
effaced
the
soft
wave
wanderings
as
in
a
picture
the
solid
mass
of
a
crag
or
the
rough
boles
of
a
great
oak
drawn
in
dark
and
strong
on
the
foreground
efface
the
aerial
distance
of
azure
hill
sunny
horizon
and
blended
clouds
where
tint
melts
into
tint
the
din
was
on
the
causeway
a
horse
was
coming
the
windings
of
the
lane
yet
hid
it
but
it
approached
i
was
just
leaving
the
stile
yet
as
the
path
was
narrow
i
sat
still
to
let
it
go
by
in
those
days
i
was
young
and
all
sorts
of
fancies
bright
and
dark
tenanted
my
mind
the
memories
of
nursery
stories
were
there
amongst
other
rubbish
and
when
they
recurred
maturing
youth
added
to
them
a
vigour
and
vividness
beyond
what
childhood
could
give
as
this
horse
approached
and
as
i
watched
for
it
to
appear
through
the
dusk
i
remembered
certain
of
bessie
s
tales
wherein
figured
a
north
of
england
spirit
called
a
gytrash
which
in
the
form
of
horse
mule
or
large
dog
haunted
solitary
ways
and
sometimes
came
upon
belated
travellers
as
this
horse
was
now
coming
upon
me
it
was
very
near
but
not
yet
in
sight
when
in
addition
to
the
tramp
tramp
i
heard
a
rush
under
the
hedge
and
close
down
by
the
hazel
stems
glided
a
great
dog
whose
black
and
white
colour
made
him
a
distinct
object
against
the
trees
it
was
exactly
one
form
of
bessie
s
gytrash
a
lion
like
creature
with
long
hair
and
a
huge
head
it
passed
me
however
quietly
enough
not
staying
to
look
up
with
strange
pretercanine
eyes
in
my
face
as
i
half
expected
it
would
the
horse
followed
a
tall
steed
and
on
its
back
a
rider
the
man
the
human
being
broke
the
spell
at
once
nothing
ever
rode
the
gytrash
it
was
always
alone
and
goblins
to
my
notions
though
they
might
tenant
the
dumb
carcasses
of
beasts
could
scarce
covet
shelter
in
the
commonplace
human
form
no
gytrash
was
this
only
a
traveller
taking
the
short
cut
to
millcote
he
passed
and
i
went
on
a
few
steps
and
i
turned
a
sliding
sound
and
an
exclamation
of
what
the
deuce
is
to
do
now
and
a
clattering
tumble
arrested
my
attention
man
and
horse
were
down
they
had
slipped
on
the
sheet
of
ice
which
glazed
the
causeway
the
dog
came
bounding
back
and
seeing
his
master
in
a
predicament
and
hearing
the
horse
groan
barked
till
the
evening
hills
echoed
the
sound
which
was
deep
in
proportion
to
his
magnitude
he
snuffed
round
the
prostrate
group
and
then
he
ran
up
to
me
it
was
all
he
could
do
there
was
no
other
help
at
hand
to
summon
i
obeyed
him
and
walked
down
to
the
traveller
by
this
time
struggling
himself
free
of
his
steed
his
efforts
were
so
vigorous
i
thought
he
could
not
be
much
hurt
but
i
asked
him
the
question
are
you
injured
sir
i
think
he
was
swearing
but
am
not
certain
however
he
was
pronouncing
some
formula
which
prevented
him
from
replying
to
me
directly
can
i
do
anything
i
asked
again
you
must
just
stand
on
one
side
he
answered
as
he
rose
first
to
his
knees
and
then
to
his
feet
i
did
whereupon
began
a
heaving
stamping
clattering
process
accompanied
by
a
barking
and
baying
which
removed
me
effectually
some
yards
distance
but
i
would
not
be
driven
quite
away
till
i
saw
the
event
this
was
finally
fortunate
the
horse
was
re
established
and
the
dog
was
silenced
with
a
down
pilot
the
traveller
now
stooping
felt
his
foot
and
leg
as
if
trying
whether
they
were
sound
apparently
something
ailed
them
for
he
halted
to
the
stile
whence
i
had
just
risen
and
sat
down
i
was
in
the
mood
for
being
useful
or
at
least
officious
i
think
for
i
now
drew
near
him
again
if
you
are
hurt
and
want
help
sir
i
can
fetch
some
one
either
from
thornfield
hall
or
from
hay
thank
you
i
shall
do
i
have
no
broken
bones
only
a
sprain
and
again
he
stood
up
and
tried
his
foot
but
the
result
extorted
an
involuntary
ugh
something
of
daylight
still
lingered
and
the
moon
was
waxing
bright
i
could
see
him
plainly
his
figure
was
enveloped
in
a
riding
cloak
fur
collared
and
steel
clasped
its
details
were
not
apparent
but
i
traced
the
general
points
of
middle
height
and
considerable
breadth
of
chest
he
had
a
dark
face
with
stern
features
and
a
heavy
brow
his
eyes
and
gathered
eyebrows
looked
ireful
and
thwarted
just
now
he
was
past
youth
but
had
not
reached
middle
age
perhaps
he
might
be
thirty
five
i
felt
no
fear
of
him
and
but
little
shyness
had
he
been
a
handsome
heroic
looking
young
gentleman
i
should
not
have
dared
to
stand
thus
questioning
him
against
his
will
and
offering
my
services
unasked
i
had
hardly
ever
seen
a
handsome
youth
never
in
my
life
spoken
to
one
i
had
a
theoretical
reverence
and
homage
for
beauty
elegance
gallantry
fascination
but
had
i
met
those
qualities
incarnate
in
masculine
shape
i
should
have
known
instinctively
that
they
neither
had
nor
could
have
sympathy
with
anything
in
me
and
should
have
shunned
them
as
one
would
fire
lightning
or
anything
else
that
is
bright
but
antipathetic
if
even
this
stranger
had
smiled
and
been
good
humoured
to
me
when
i
addressed
him
if
he
had
put
off
my
offer
of
assistance
gaily
and
with
thanks
i
should
have
gone
on
my
way
and
not
felt
any
vocation
to
renew
inquiries
but
the
frown
the
roughness
of
the
traveller
set
me
at
my
ease
i
retained
my
station
when
he
waved
to
me
to
go
and
announced
i
cannot
think
of
leaving
you
sir
at
so
late
an
hour
in
this
solitary
lane
till
i
see
you
are
fit
to
mount
your
horse
he
looked
at
me
when
i
said
this
he
had
hardly
turned
his
eyes
in
my
direction
before
i
should
think
you
ought
to
be
at
home
yourself
said
he
if
you
have
a
home
in
this
neighbourhood
where
do
you
come
from
from
just
below
and
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
being
out
late
when
it
is
moonlight
i
will
run
over
to
hay
for
you
with
pleasure
if
you
wish
it
indeed
i
am
going
there
to
post
a
letter
you
live
just
below
do
you
mean
at
that
house
with
the
battlements
pointing
to
thornfield
hall
on
which
the
moon
cast
a
hoary
gleam
bringing
it
out
distinct
and
pale
from
the
woods
that
by
contrast
with
the
western
sky
now
seemed
one
mass
of
shadow
yes
sir
whose
house
is
it
mr
rochester
s
do
you
know
mr
rochester
no
i
have
never
seen
him
he
is
not
resident
then
no
can
you
tell
me
where
he
is
i
cannot
you
are
not
a
servant
at
the
hall
of
course
you
are
he
stopped
ran
his
eye
over
my
dress
which
as
usual
was
quite
simple
a
black
merino
cloak
a
black
beaver
bonnet
neither
of
them
half
fine
enough
for
a
lady
s
maid
he
seemed
puzzled
to
decide
what
i
was
i
helped
him
i
am
the
governess
ah
the
governess
he
repeated
deuce
take
me
if
i
had
not
forgotten
the
governess
and
again
my
raiment
underwent
scrutiny
in
two
minutes
he
rose
from
the
stile
his
face
expressed
pain
when
he
tried
to
move
i
cannot
commission
you
to
fetch
help
he
said
but
you
may
help
me
a
little
yourself
if
you
will
be
so
kind
yes
sir
you
have
not
an
umbrella
that
i
can
use
as
a
stick
no
try
to
get
hold
of
my
horse
s
bridle
and
lead
him
to
me
you
are
not
afraid
i
should
have
been
afraid
to
touch
a
horse
when
alone
but
when
told
to
do
it
i
was
disposed
to
obey
i
put
down
my
muff
on
the
stile
and
went
up
to
the
tall
steed
i
endeavoured
to
catch
the
bridle
but
it
was
a
spirited
thing
and
would
not
let
me
come
near
its
head
i
made
effort
on
effort
though
in
vain
meantime
i
was
mortally
afraid
of
its
trampling
fore
feet
the
traveller
waited
and
watched
for
some
time
and
at
last
he
laughed
i
was
mortally
afraid
of
its
trampling
forefeet
p107
jpg
i
see
he
said
the
mountain
will
never
be
brought
to
mahomet
so
all
you
can
do
is
to
aid
mahomet
to
go
to
the
mountain
i
must
beg
of
you
to
come
here
i
came
excuse
me
he
continued
necessity
compels
me
to
make
you
useful
he
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
leaning
on
me
with
some
stress
limped
to
his
horse
having
once
caught
the
bridle
he
mastered
it
directly
and
sprang
to
his
saddle
grimacing
grimly
as
he
made
the
effort
for
it
wrenched
his
sprain
now
said
he
releasing
his
under
lip
from
a
hard
bite
just
hand
me
my
whip
it
lies
there
under
the
hedge
i
sought
it
and
found
it
thank
you
now
make
haste
with
the
letter
to
hay
and
return
as
fast
as
you
can
a
touch
of
a
spurred
heel
made
his
horse
first
start
and
rear
and
then
bound
away
the
dog
rushed
in
his
traces
all
three
vanished
like
heath
that
in
the
wilderness
the
wild
wind
whirls
away
i
took
up
my
muff
and
walked
on
the
incident
had
occurred
and
was
gone
for
me
it
was
an
incident
of
no
moment
no
romance
no
interest
in
a
sense
yet
it
marked
with
change
one
single
hour
of
a
monotonous
life
my
help
had
been
needed
and
claimed
i
had
given
it
i
was
pleased
to
have
done
something
trivial
transitory
though
the
deed
was
it
was
yet
an
active
thing
and
i
was
weary
of
an
existence
all
passive
the
new
face
too
was
like
a
new
picture
introduced
to
the
gallery
of
memory
and
it
was
dissimilar
to
all
the
others
hanging
there
firstly
because
it
was
masculine
and
secondly
because
it
was
dark
strong
and
stern
i
had
it
still
before
me
when
i
entered
hay
and
slipped
the
letter
into
the
post
office
i
saw
it
as
i
walked
fast
down
hill
all
the
way
home
when
i
came
to
the
stile
i
stopped
a
minute
looked
round
and
listened
with
an
idea
that
a
horse
s
hoofs
might
ring
on
the
causeway
again
and
that
a
rider
in
a
cloak
and
a
gytrash
like
newfoundland
dog
might
be
again
apparent
i
saw
only
the
hedge
and
a
pollard
willow
before
me
rising
up
still
and
straight
to
meet
the
moonbeams
i
heard
only
the
faintest
waft
of
wind
roaming
fitful
among
the
trees
round
thornfield
a
mile
distant
and
when
i
glanced
down
in
the
direction
of
the
murmur
my
eye
traversing
the
hall
front
caught
a
light
kindling
in
a
window
it
reminded
me
that
i
was
late
and
i
hurried
on
i
did
not
like
re
entering
thornfield
to
pass
its
threshold
was
to
return
to
stagnation
to
cross
the
silent
hall
to
ascend
the
darksome
staircase
to
seek
my
own
lonely
little
room
and
then
to
meet
tranquil
mrs
fairfax
and
spend
the
long
winter
evening
with
her
and
her
only
was
to
quell
wholly
the
faint
excitement
wakened
by
my
walk
to
slip
again
over
my
faculties
the
viewless
fetters
of
an
uniform
and
too
still
existence
of
an
existence
whose
very
privileges
of
security
and
ease
i
was
becoming
incapable
of
appreciating
what
good
it
would
have
done
me
at
that
time
to
have
been
tossed
in
the
storms
of
an
uncertain
struggling
life
and
to
have
been
taught
by
rough
and
bitter
experience
to
long
for
the
calm
amidst
which
i
now
repined
yes
just
as
much
good
as
it
would
do
a
man
tired
of
sitting
still
in
a
too
easy
chair
to
take
a
long
walk
and
just
as
natural
was
the
wish
to
stir
under
my
circumstances
as
it
would
be
under
his
i
lingered
at
the
gates
i
lingered
on
the
lawn
i
paced
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
pavement
the
shutters
of
the
glass
door
were
closed
i
could
not
see
into
the
interior
and
both
my
eyes
and
spirit
seemed
drawn
from
the
gloomy
house
from
the
grey
hollow
filled
with
rayless
cells
as
it
appeared
to
me
to
that
sky
expanded
before
me
a
blue
sea
absolved
from
taint
of
cloud
the
moon
ascending
it
in
solemn
march
her
orb
seeming
to
look
up
as
she
left
the
hill
tops
from
behind
which
she
had
come
far
and
farther
below
her
and
aspired
to
the
zenith
midnight
dark
in
its
fathomless
depth
and
measureless
distance
and
for
those
trembling
stars
that
followed
her
course
they
made
my
heart
tremble
my
veins
glow
when
i
viewed
them
little
things
recall
us
to
earth
the
clock
struck
in
the
hall
that
sufficed
i
turned
from
moon
and
stars
opened
a
side
door
and
went
in
the
hall
was
not
dark
nor
yet
was
it
lit
only
by
the
high
hung
bronze
lamp
a
warm
glow
suffused
both
it
and
the
lower
steps
of
the
oak
staircase
this
ruddy
shine
issued
from
the
great
dining
room
whose
two
leaved
door
stood
open
and
showed
a
genial
fire
in
the
grate
glancing
on
marble
hearth
and
brass
fire
irons
and
revealing
purple
draperies
and
polished
furniture
in
the
most
pleasant
radiance
it
revealed
too
a
group
near
the
mantelpiece
i
had
scarcely
caught
it
and
scarcely
become
aware
of
a
cheerful
mingling
of
voices
amongst
which
i
seemed
to
distinguish
the
tones
of
adele
when
the
door
closed
i
hastened
to
mrs
fairfax
s
room
there
was
a
fire
there
too
but
no
candle
and
no
mrs
fairfax
instead
all
alone
sitting
upright
on
the
rug
and
gazing
with
gravity
at
the
blaze
i
beheld
a
great
black
and
white
long
haired
dog
just
like
the
gytrash
of
the
lane
it
was
so
like
it
that
i
went
forward
and
said
pilot
and
the
thing
got
up
and
came
to
me
and
snuffed
me
i
caressed
him
and
he
wagged
his
great
tail
but
he
looked
an
eerie
creature
to
be
alone
with
and
i
could
not
tell
whence
he
had
come
i
rang
the
bell
for
i
wanted
a
candle
and
i
wanted
too
to
get
an
account
of
this
visitant
leah
entered
what
dog
is
this
he
came
with
master
with
whom
with
master
mr
rochester
he
is
just
arrived
indeed
and
is
mrs
fairfax

him

miss

the
dining
room
and
john

and

down
hill

slipped
on
some
ice
ah

candle

it
she
entered
followed
by
mrs
fairfax
who
repeated
the
news
adding
that
mr
carter
the
surgeon
was
come
and
was
now
with
mr
rochester
then
she
hurried
out
to
give
orders
about
tea
and
i
went
upstairs
to
take
off
my
things
chapter
xiii
mr
rochester
it
seems
by
the
surgeon
s
orders
went
to
bed
early
that
night
nor
did
he
rise
soon
next
morning
when
he
did
come
down
it
was
to
attend
to
business
his
agent
and
some
of
his
tenants
were
arrived
and
waiting
to
speak
with
him
adele
and
i
had
now
to
vacate
the
library
it
would
be
in
daily
requisition
as
a
reception
room
for
callers
a
fire
was
lit
in
an
apartment
upstairs
and
there
i
carried
our
books
and
arranged
it
for
the
future
schoolroom
i
discerned
in
the
course
of
the
morning
that
thornfield
hall
was
a
changed
place
no
longer
silent
as
a
church
it
echoed
every
hour
or
two
to
a
knock
at
the
door
or
a
clang
of
the
bell
steps
too
often
traversed
the
hall
and
new
voices
spoke
in
different
keys
below
a
rill
from
the
outer
world
was
flowing
through
it
it
had
a
master
for
my
part
i
liked
it
better
adele
was
not
easy
to
teach
that
day
she
could
not
apply
she
kept
running
to
the
door
and
looking
over
the
banisters
to
see
if
she
could
get
a
glimpse
of
mr
rochester
then
she
coined
pretexts
to
go
downstairs
in
order
as
i
shrewdly
suspected
to
visit
the
library
where
i
knew
she
was
not
wanted
then
when
i
got
a
little
angry
and
made
her
sit
still
she
continued
to
talk
incessantly
of
her
ami
monsieur
edouard
fairfax
de
rochester
as
she
dubbed
him
i
had
not
before
heard
his
prenomens
and
to
conjecture
what
presents
he
had
brought
her
for
it
appears
he
had
intimated
the
night
before
that
when
his
luggage
came
from
millcote
there
would
be
found
amongst
it
a
little
box
in
whose
contents
she
had
an
interest
et
cela
doit
signifier
said
she
qu
il
y
aura
la
dedans
un
cadeau
pour
moi
et
peut
etre
pour
vous
aussi
mademoiselle
monsieur
a
parle
de
vous
il
m
a
demande
le
nom
de
ma
gouvernante
et
si
elle
n
etait
pas
une
petite
personne
assez
mince
et
un
peu
pale
j
ai
dit
qu
oui
car
c
est
vrai
n
est
ce
pas
mademoiselle
i
and
my
pupil
dined
as
usual
in
mrs
fairfax
s
parlour
the
afternoon
was
wild
and
snowy
and
we
passed
it
in
the
schoolroom
at
dark
i
allowed
adele
to
put
away
books
and
work
and
to
run
downstairs
for
from
the
comparative
silence
below
and
from
the
cessation
of
appeals
to
the
door
bell
i
conjectured
that
mr
rochester
was
now
at
liberty
left
alone
i
walked
to
the
window
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
thence
twilight
and
snowflakes
together
thickened
the
air
and
hid
the
very
shrubs
on
the
lawn
i
let
down
the
curtain
and
went
back
to
the
fireside
in
the
clear
embers
i
was
tracing
a
view
not
unlike
a
picture
i
remembered
to
have
seen
of
the
castle
of
heidelberg
on
the
rhine
when
mrs
fairfax
came
in
breaking
up
by
her
entrance
the
fiery
mosaic
i
had
been
piercing
together
and
scattering
too
some
heavy
unwelcome
thoughts
that
were
beginning
to
throng
on
my
solitude
mr
rochester
would
be
glad
if
you
and
your
pupil
would
take
tea
with
him
in
the
drawing
room
this
evening
said
she
he
has
been
so
much
engaged
all
day
that
he
could
not
ask
to
see
you
before
when
is
his
tea
time
i
inquired
oh
at
six
o
clock
he
keeps
early
hours
in
the
country
you
had
better
change
your
frock
now
i
will
go
with
you
and
fasten
it
here
is
a
candle
is
it
necessary
to
change
my
frock
yes
you
had
better
i
always
dress
for
the
evening
when
mr
rochester
is
here
this
additional
ceremony
seemed
somewhat
stately
however
i
repaired
to
my
room
and
with
mrs
fairfax
s
aid
replaced
my
black
stuff
dress
by
one
of
black
silk
the
best
and
the
only
additional
one
i
had
except
one
of
light
grey
which
in
my
lowood
notions
of
the
toilette
i
thought
too
fine
to
be
worn
except
on
first
rate
occasions
you
want
a
brooch
said
mrs
fairfax
i
had
a
single
little
pearl
ornament
which
miss
temple
gave
me
as
a
parting
keepsake
i
put
it
on
and
then
we
went
downstairs
unused
as
i
was
to
strangers
it
was
rather
a
trial
to
appear
thus
formally
summoned
in
mr
rochester
s
presence
i
let
mrs
fairfax
precede
me
into
the
dining
room
and
kept
in
her
shade
as
we
crossed
that
apartment
and
passing
the
arch
whose
curtain
was
now
dropped
entered
the
elegant
recess
beyond
two
wax
candles
stood
lighted
on
the
table
and
two
on
the
mantelpiece
basking
in
the
light
and
heat
of
a
superb
fire
lay
pilot
adele
knelt
near
him
half
reclined
on
a
couch
appeared
mr
rochester
his
foot
supported
by
the
cushion
he
was
looking
at
adele
and
the
dog
the
fire
shone
full
on
his
face
i
knew
my
traveller
with
his
broad
and
jetty
eyebrows
his
square
forehead
made
squarer
by
the
horizontal
sweep
of
his
black
hair
i
recognised
his
decisive
nose
more
remarkable
for
character
than
beauty
his
full
nostrils
denoting
i
thought
choler
his
grim
mouth
chin
and
jaw
yes
all
three
were
very
grim
and
no
mistake
his
shape
now
divested
of
cloak
i
perceived
harmonised
in
squareness
with
his
physiognomy
i
suppose
it
was
a
good
figure
in
the
athletic
sense
of
the
term
broad
chested
and
thin
flanked
though
neither
tall
nor
graceful
mr
rochester
must
have
been
aware
of
the
entrance
of
mrs
fairfax
and
myself
but
it
appeared
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
notice
us
for
he
never
lifted
his
head
as
we
approached
here
is
miss
eyre
sir
said
mrs
fairfax
in
her
quiet
way
he
bowed
still
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
group
of
the
dog
and
child
let
miss
eyre
be
seated
said
he
and
there
was
something
in
the
forced
stiff
bow
in
the
impatient
yet
formal
tone
which
seemed
further
to
express
what
the
deuce
is
it
to
me
whether
miss
eyre
be
there
or
not
at
this
moment
i
am
not
disposed
to
accost
her
i
sat
down
quite
disembarrassed
a
reception
of
finished
politeness
would
probably
have
confused
me
i
could
not
have
returned
or
repaid
it
by
answering
grace
and
elegance
on
my
part
but
harsh
caprice
laid
me
under
no
obligation
on
the
contrary
a
decent
quiescence
under
the
freak
of
manner
gave
me
the
advantage
besides
the
eccentricity
of
the
proceeding
was
piquant
i
felt
interested
to
see
how
he
would
go
on
he
went
on
as
a
statue
would
that
is
he
neither
spoke
nor
moved
mrs
fairfax
seemed
to
think
it
necessary
that
some
one
should
be
amiable
and
she
began
to
talk
kindly
as
usual
and
as
usual
rather
trite
she
condoled
with
him
on
the
pressure
of
business
he
had
had
all
day
on
the
annoyance
it
must
have
been
to
him
with
that
painful
sprain
then
she
commended
his
patience
and
perseverance
in
going
through
with
it
madam
i
should
like
some
tea
was
the
sole
rejoinder
she
got
she
hastened
to
ring
the
bell
and
when
the
tray
came
she
proceeded
to
arrange
the
cups
spoons
c
with
assiduous
celerity
i
and
adele
went
to
the
table
but
the
master
did
not
leave
his
couch
will
you
hand
mr
rochester
s
cup
said
mrs
fairfax
to
me
adele
might
perhaps
spill
it
i
did
as
requested
as
he
took
the
cup
from
my
hand
adele
thinking
the
moment
propitious
for
making
a
request
in
my
favour
cried
out
n
est
ce
pas
monsieur
qu
il
y
a
un
cadeau
pour
mademoiselle
eyre
dans
votre
petit
coffre
who
talks
of
cadeaux
said
he
gruffly
did
you
expect
a
present
miss
eyre
are
you
fond
of
presents
and
he
searched
my
face
with
eyes
that
i
saw
were
dark
irate
and
piercing
i
hardly
know
sir
i
have
little
experience
of
them
they
are
generally
thought
pleasant
things
generally
thought
but
what
do
you
think
i
should
be
obliged
to
take
time
sir
before
i
could
give
you
an
answer
worthy
of
your
acceptance
a
present
has
many
faces
to
it
has
it
not
and
one
should
consider
all
before
pronouncing
an
opinion
as
to
its
nature
miss
eyre
you
are
not
so
unsophisticated
as
adele
she
demands
a
cadeau
clamorously
the
moment
she
sees
me
you
beat
about
the
bush
because
i
have
less
confidence
in
my
deserts
than
adele
has
she
can
prefer
the
claim
of
old
acquaintance
and
the
right
too
of
custom
for
she
says
you
have
always
been
in
the
habit
of
giving
her
playthings
but
if
i
had
to
make
out
a
case
i
should
be
puzzled
since
i
am
a
stranger
and
have
done
nothing
to
entitle
me
to
an
acknowledgment
oh
don
t
fall
back
on
over
modesty
i
have
examined
adele
and
find
you
have
taken
great
pains
with
her
she
is
not
bright
she
has
no
talents
yet
in
a
short
time
she
has
made
much
improvement
sir
you
have
now
given
me
my
cadeau
i
am
obliged
to
you
it
is
the
meed
teachers
most
covet
praise
of
their
pupils
progress
humph
said
mr
rochester
and
he
took
his
tea
in
silence
come
to
the
fire
said
the
master
when
the
tray
was
taken
away
and
mrs
fairfax
had
settled
into
a
corner
with
her
knitting
while
adele
was
leading
me
by
the
hand
round
the
room
showing
me
the
beautiful
books
and
ornaments
on
the
consoles
and
chiffonnieres
we
obeyed
as
in
duty
bound
adele
wanted
to
take
a
seat
on
my
knee
but
she
was
ordered
to
amuse
herself
with
pilot
you
have
been
resident
in
my
house
three
months
yes
sir
and
you
came
from
from
lowood
school
in
shire
ah
a
charitable
concern
how
long
were
you
there
eight
years
eight
years
you
must
be
tenacious
of
life
i
thought
half
the
time
in
such
a
place
would
have
done
up
any
constitution
no
wonder
you
have
rather
the
look
of
another
world
i
marvelled
where
you
had
got
that
sort
of
face
when
you
came
on
me
in
hay
lane
last
night
i
thought
unaccountably
of
fairy
tales
and
had
half
a
mind
to
demand
whether
you
had
bewitched
my
horse
i
am
not
sure
yet
who
are
your
parents
i
have
none
nor
ever
had
i
suppose
do
you
remember
them
no
i
thought
not
and
so
you
were
waiting
for
your
people
when
you
sat
on
that
stile
for
whom
sir
for
the
men
in
green
it
was
a
proper
moonlight
evening
for
them
did
i
break
through
one
of
your
rings
that
you
spread
that
damned
ice
on
the
causeway
i
shook
my
head
the
men
in
green
all
forsook
england
a
hundred
years
ago
said
i
speaking
as
seriously
as
he
had
done
and
not
even
in
hay
lane
or
the
fields
about
it
could
you
find
a
trace
of
them
i
don
t
think
either
summer
or
harvest
or
winter
moon
will
ever
shine
on
their
revels
more
mrs
fairfax
had
dropped
her
knitting
and
with
raised
eyebrows
seemed
wondering
what
sort
of
talk
this
was
well
resumed
mr
rochester
if
you
disown
parents
you
must
have
some
sort
of
kinsfolk
uncles
and
aunts
no
none
that
i
ever
saw
and
your
home
i
have
none
where
do
your
brothers
and
sisters
live
i
have
no
brothers
or
sisters
who
recommended
you
to
come
here
i
advertised
and
mrs
fairfax
answered
my
advertisement
yes
said
the
good
lady
who
now
knew
what
ground
we
were
upon
and
i
am
daily
thankful
for
the
choice
providence
led
me
to
make
miss
eyre
has
been
an
invaluable
companion
to
me
and
a
kind
and
careful
teacher
to
adele
don
t
trouble
yourself
to
give
her
a
character
returned
mr
rochester
eulogiums
will
not
bias
me
i
shall
judge
for
myself
she
began
by
felling
my
horse
sir
said
mrs
fairfax
i
have
to
thank
her
for
this
sprain
the
widow
looked
bewildered
miss
eyre
have
you
ever
lived
in
a
town
no
sir
have
you
seen
much
society
none
but
the
pupils
and
teachers
of
lowood
and
now
the
inmates
of
thornfield
have
you
read
much
only
such
books
as
came
in
my
way
and
they
have
not
been
numerous
or
very
learned
you
have
lived
the
life
of
a
nun
no
doubt
you
are
well
drilled
in
religious
forms
brocklehurst
who
i
understand
directs
lowood
is
a
parson
is
he
not
yes
sir
and
you
girls
probably
worshipped
him
as
a
convent
full
of
religieuses
would
worship
their
director
oh
no
you
are
very
cool
no
what
a
novice
not
worship
her
priest
that
sounds
blasphemous
i
disliked
mr
brocklehurst
and
i
was
not
alone
in
the
feeling
he
is
a
harsh
man
at
once
pompous
and
meddling
he
cut
off
our
hair
and
for
economy
s
sake
bought
us
bad
needles
and
thread
with
which
we
could
hardly
sew
that
was
very
false
economy
remarked
mrs
fairfax
who
now
again
caught
the
drift
of
the
dialogue
and
was
that
the
head
and
front
of
his
offending
demanded
mr
rochester
he
starved
us
when
he
had
the
sole
superintendence
of
the
provision
department
before
the
committee
was
appointed
and
he
bored
us
with
long
lectures
once
a
week
and
with
evening
readings
from
books
of
his
own
inditing
about
sudden
deaths
and
judgments
which
made
us
afraid
to
go
to
bed
what
age
were
you
when
you
went
to
lowood
about
ten
and
you
stayed
there
eight
years
you
are
now
then
eighteen
i
assented
arithmetic
you
see
is
useful
without
its
aid
i
should
hardly
have
been
able
to
guess
your
age
it
is
a
point
difficult
to
fix
where
the
features
and
countenance
are
so
much
at
variance
as
in
your
case
and
now
what
did
you
learn
at
lowood
can
you
play
a
little
of
course
that
is
the
established
answer
go
into
the
library
i
mean
if
you
please
excuse
my
tone
of
command
i
am
used
to
say
do
this
and
it
is
done
i
cannot
alter
my
customary
habits
for
one
new
inmate
go
then
into
the
library
take
a
candle
with
you
leave
the
door
open
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
play
a
tune
i
departed
obeying
his
directions
enough
he
called
out
in
a
few
minutes
you
play
a
little
i
see
like
any
other
english
school
girl
perhaps
rather
better
than
some
but
not
well
i
closed
the
piano
and
returned
mr
rochester
continued
adele
showed
me
some
sketches
this
morning
which
she
said
were
yours
i
don
t
know
whether
they
were
entirely
of
your
doing
probably
a
master
aided
you
no
indeed
i
interjected
ah
that
pricks
pride
well
fetch
me
your
portfolio
if
you
can
vouch
for
its
contents
being
original
but
don
t
pass
your
word
unless
you
are
certain
i
can
recognise
patchwork
then
i
will
say
nothing
and
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
sir
i
brought
the
portfolio
from
the
library
approach
the
table
said
he
and
i
wheeled
it
to
his
couch
adele
and
mrs
fairfax
drew
near
to
see
the
pictures
no
crowding
said
mr
rochester
take
the
drawings
from
my
hand
as
i
finish
with
them
but
don
t
push
your
faces
up
to
mine
he
deliberately
scrutinised
each
sketch
and
painting
three
he
laid
aside
the
others
when
he
had
examined
them
he
swept
from
him
take
them
off
to
the
other
table
mrs
fairfax
said
he
and
look
at
them
with
adele
you
glancing
at
me
resume
your
seat
and
answer
my
questions
i
perceive
those
pictures
were
done
by
one
hand
was
that
hand
yours
yes
and
when
did
you
find
time
to
do
them
they
have
taken
much
time
and
some
thought
i
did
them
in
the
last
two
vacations
i
spent
at
lowood
when
i
had
no
other
occupation
where
did
you
get
your
copies
out
of
my
head
that
head
i
see
now
on
your
shoulders
yes
sir
has
it
other
furniture
of
the
same
kind
within
i
should
think
it
may
have
i
should
hope
better
he
spread
the
pictures
before
him
and
again
surveyed
them
alternately
while
he
is
so
occupied
i
will
tell
you
reader
what
they
are
and
first
i
must
premise
that
they
are
nothing
wonderful
the
subjects
had
indeed
risen
vividly
on
my
mind
as
i
saw
them
with
the
spiritual
eye
before
i
attempted
to
embody
them
they
were
striking
but
my
hand
would
not
second
my
fancy
and
in
each
case
it
had
wrought
out
but
a
pale
portrait
of
the
thing
i
had
conceived
these
pictures
were
in
water
colours
the
first
represented
clouds
low
and
livid
rolling
over
a
swollen
sea
all
the
distance
was
in
eclipse
so
too
was
the
foreground
or
rather
the
nearest
billows
for
there
was
no
land
one
gleam
of
light
lifted
into
relief
a
half
submerged
mast
on
which
sat
a
cormorant
dark
and
large
with
wings
flecked
with
foam
its
beak
held
a
gold
bracelet
set
with
gems
that
i
had
touched
with
as
brilliant
tints
as
my
palette
could
yield
and
as
glittering
distinctness
as
my
pencil
could
impart
sinking
below
the
bird
and
mast
a
drowned
corpse
glanced
through
the
green
water
a
fair
arm
was
the
only
limb
clearly
visible
whence
the
bracelet
had
been
washed
or
torn
the
second
picture
contained
for
foreground
only
the
dim
peak
of
a
hill
with
grass
and
some
leaves
slanting
as
if
by
a
breeze
beyond
and
above
spread
an
expanse
of
sky
dark
blue
as
at
twilight
rising
into
the
sky
was
a
woman
s
shape
to
the
bust
portrayed
in
tints
as
dusk
and
soft
as
i
could
combine
the
dim
forehead
was
crowned
with
a
star
the
lineaments
below
were
seen
as
through
the
suffusion
of
vapour
the
eyes
shone
dark
and
wild
the
hair
streamed
shadowy
like
a
beamless
cloud
torn
by
storm
or
by
electric
travail
on
the
neck
lay
a
pale
reflection
like
moonlight
the
same
faint
lustre
touched
the
train
of
thin
clouds
from
which
rose
and
bowed
this
vision
of
the
evening
star
the
third
showed
the
pinnacle
of
an
iceberg
piercing
a
polar
winter
sky
a
muster
of
northern
lights
reared
their
dim
lances
close
serried
along
the
horizon
throwing
these
into
distance
rose
in
the
foreground
a
head
a
colossal
head
inclined
towards
the
iceberg
and
resting
against
it
two
thin
hands
joined
under
the
forehead
and
supporting
it
drew
up
before
the
lower
features
a
sable
veil
a
brow
quite
bloodless
white
as
bone
and
an
eye
hollow
and
fixed
blank
of
meaning
but
for
the
glassiness
of
despair
alone
were
visible
above
the
temples
amidst
wreathed
turban
folds
of
black
drapery
vague
in
its
character
and
consistency
as
cloud
gleamed
a
ring
of
white
flame
gemmed
with
sparkles
of
a
more
lurid
tinge
this
pale
crescent
was
the
likeness
of
a
kingly
crown
what
it
diademed
was
the
shape
which
shape
had
none
were
you
happy
when
you
painted
these
pictures
asked
mr
rochester
presently
i
was
absorbed
sir
yes
and
i
was
happy
to
paint
them
in
short
was
to
enjoy
one
of
the
keenest
pleasures
i
have
ever
known
that
is
not
saying
much
your
pleasures
by
your
own
account
have
been
few
but
i
daresay
you
did
exist
in
a
kind
of
artist
s
dreamland
while
you
blent
and
arranged
these
strange
tints
did
you
sit
at
them
long
each
day
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
because
it
was
the
vacation
and
i
sat
at
them
from
morning
till
noon
and
from
noon
till
night
the
length
of
the
midsummer
days
favoured
my
inclination
to
apply
and
you
felt
self
satisfied
with
the
result
of
your
ardent
labours
far
from
it
i
was
tormented
by
the
contrast
between
my
idea
and
my
handiwork
in
each
case
i
had
imagined
something
which
i
was
quite
powerless
to
realise
not
quite
you
have
secured
the
shadow
of
your
thought
but
no
more
probably
you
had
not
enough
of
the
artist
s
skill
and
science
to
give
it
full
being
yet
the
drawings
are
for
a
school
girl
peculiar
as
to
the
thoughts
they
are
elfish
these
eyes
in
the
evening
star
you
must
have
seen
in
a
dream
how
could
you
make
them
look
so
clear
and
yet
not
at
all
brilliant
for
the
planet
above
quells
their
rays
and
what
meaning
is
that
in
their
solemn
depth
and
who
taught
you
to
paint
wind
there
is
a
high
gale
in
that
sky
and
on
this
hill
top
where
did
you
see
latmos
for
that
is
latmos
there
put
the
drawings
away
i
had
scarce
tied
the
strings
of
the
portfolio
when
looking
at
his
watch
he
said
abruptly
it
is
nine
o
clock
what
are
you
about
miss
eyre
to
let
adele
sit
up
so
long
take
her
to
bed
adele
went
to
kiss
him
before
quitting
the
room
he
endured
the
caress
but
scarcely
seemed
to
relish
it
more
than
pilot
would
have
done
nor
so
much
i
wish
you
all
good
night
now
said
he
making
a
movement
of
the
hand
towards
the
door
in
token
that
he
was
tired
of
our
company
and
wished
to
dismiss
us
mrs
fairfax
folded
up
her
knitting
i
took
my
portfolio
we
curtseyed
to
him
received
a
frigid
bow
in
return
and
so
withdrew
you
said
mr
rochester
was
not
strikingly
peculiar
mrs
fairfax
i
observed
when
i
rejoined
her
in
her
room
after
putting
adele
to
bed
well
is
he
i
think
so
he
is
very
changeful
and
abrupt
true
no
doubt
he
may
appear
so
to
a
stranger
but
i
am
so
accustomed
to
his
manner
i
never
think
of
it
and
then
if
he
has
peculiarities
of
temper
allowance
should
be
made
why
partly
because
it
is
his
nature
and
we
can
none
of
us
help
our
nature
and
partly
because
he
has
painful
thoughts
no
doubt
to
harass
him
and
make
his
spirits
unequal
what
about
family
troubles
for
one
thing
but
he
has
no
family
not
now
but
he
has
had
or
at
least
relatives
he
lost
his
elder
brother
a
few
years
since
his
elder
brother
yes
the
present
mr
rochester
has
not
been
very
long
in
possession
of
the
property
only
about
nine
years
nine
years
is
a
tolerable
time
was
he
so
very
fond
of
his
brother
as
to
be
still
inconsolable
for
his
loss
why
no
perhaps
not
i
believe
there
were
some
misunderstandings
between
them
mr
rowland
rochester
was
not
quite
just
to
mr
edward
and
perhaps
he
prejudiced
his
father
against
him
the
old
gentleman
was
fond
of
money
and
anxious
to
keep
the
family
estate
together
he
did
not
like
to
diminish
the
property
by
division
and
yet
he
was
anxious
that
mr
edward
should
have
wealth
too
to
keep
up
the
consequence
of
the
name
and
soon
after
he
was
of
age
some
steps
were
taken
that
were
not
quite
fair
and
made
a
great
deal
of
mischief
old
mr
rochester
and
mr
rowland
combined
to
bring
mr
edward
into
what
he
considered
a
painful
position
for
the
sake
of
making
his
fortune
what
the
precise
nature
of
that
position
was
i
never
clearly
knew
but
his
spirit
could
not
brook
what
he
had
to
suffer
in
it
he
is
not
very
forgiving
he
broke
with
his
family
and
now
for
many
years
he
has
led
an
unsettled
kind
of
life
i
don
t
think
he
has
ever
been
resident
at
thornfield
for
a
fortnight
together
since
the
death
of
his
brother
without
a
will
left
him
master
of
the
estate
and
indeed
no
wonder
he
shuns
the
old
place
why
should
he
shun
it
perhaps
he
thinks
it
gloomy
the
answer
was
evasive
i
should
have
liked
something
clearer
but
mrs
fairfax
either
could
not
or
would
not
give
me
more
explicit
information
of
the
origin
and
nature
of
mr
rochester
s
trials
she
averred
they
were
a
mystery
to
herself
and
that
what
she
knew
was
chiefly
from
conjecture
it
was
evident
indeed
that
she
wished
me
to
drop
the
subject
which
i
did
accordingly
chapter
xiv
for
several
subsequent
days
i
saw
little
of
mr
rochester
in
the
mornings
he
seemed
much
engaged
with
business
and
in
the
afternoon
gentlemen
from
millcote
or
the
neighbourhood
called
and
sometimes
stayed
to
dine
with
him
when
his
sprain
was
well
enough
to
admit
of
horse
exercise
he
rode
out
a
good
deal
probably
to
return
these
visits
as
he
generally
did
not
come
back
till
late
at
night
during
this
interval
even
adele
was
seldom
sent
for
to
his
presence
and
all
my
acquaintance
with
him
was
confined
to
an
occasional
rencontre
in
the
hall
on
the
stairs
or
in
the
gallery
when
he
would
sometimes
pass
me
haughtily
and
coldly
just
acknowledging
my
presence
by
a
distant
nod
or
a
cool
glance
and
sometimes
bow
and
smile
with
gentlemanlike
affability
his
changes
of
mood
did
not
offend
me
because
i
saw
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
alternation
the
ebb
and
flow
depended
on
causes
quite
disconnected
with
me
one
day
he
had
had
company
to
dinner
and
had
sent
for
my
portfolio
in
order
doubtless
to
exhibit
its
contents
the
gentlemen
went
away
early
to
attend
a
public
meeting
at
millcote
as
mrs
fairfax
informed
me
but
the
night
being
wet
and
inclement
mr
rochester
did
not
accompany
them
soon
after
they
were
gone
he
rang
the
bell
a
message
came
that
i
and
adele
were
to
go
downstairs
i
brushed
adele
s
hair
and
made
her
neat
and
having
ascertained
that
i
was
myself
in
my
usual
quaker
trim
where
there
was
nothing
to
retouch
all
being
too
close
and
plain
braided
locks
included
to
admit
of
disarrangement
we
descended
adele
wondering
whether
the
petit
coffre
was
at
length
come
for
owing
to
some
mistake
its
arrival
had
hitherto
been
delayed
she
was
gratified
there
it
stood
a
little
carton
on
the
table
when
we
entered
the
dining
room
she
appeared
to
know
it
by
instinct
ma
boite
ma
boite
exclaimed
she
running
towards
it
yes
there
is
your
boite
at
last
take
it
into
a
corner
you
genuine
daughter
of
paris
and
amuse
yourself
with
disembowelling
it
said
the
deep
and
rather
sarcastic
voice
of
mr
rochester
proceeding
from
the
depths
of
an
immense
easy
chair
at
the
fireside
and
mind
he
continued
don
t
bother
me
with
any
details
of
the
anatomical
process
or
any
notice
of
the
condition
of
the
entrails
let
your
operation
be
conducted
in
silence
tiens
toi
tranquille
enfant
comprends
tu
adele
seemed
scarcely
to
need
the
warning
she
had
already
retired
to
a
sofa
with
her
treasure
and
was
busy
untying
the
cord
which
secured
the
lid
having
removed
this
impediment
and
lifted
certain
silvery
envelopes
of
tissue
paper
she
merely
exclaimed
oh
ciel
que
c
est
beau
and
then
remained
absorbed
in
ecstatic
contemplation
is
miss
eyre
there
now
demanded
the
master
half
rising
from
his
seat
to
look
round
to
the
door
near
which
i
still
stood
ah
well
come
forward
be
seated
here
he
drew
a
chair
near
his
own
i
am
not
fond
of
the
prattle
of
children
he
continued
for
old
bachelor
as
i
am
i
have
no
pleasant
associations
connected
with
their
lisp
it
would
be
intolerable
to
me
to
pass
a
whole
evening
tete
a
tete
with
a
brat
don
t
draw
that
chair
farther
off
miss
eyre
sit
down
exactly
where
i
placed
it
if
you
please
that
is
confound
these
civilities
i
continually
forget
them
nor
do
i
particularly
affect
simple
minded
old
ladies
by
the
bye
i
must
have
mine
in
mind
it
won
t
do
to
neglect
her
she
is
a
fairfax
or
wed
to
one
and
blood
is
said
to
be
thicker
than
water
he
rang
and
despatched
an
invitation
to
mrs
fairfax
who
soon
arrived
knitting
basket
in
hand
good
evening
madam
i
sent
to
you
for
a
charitable
purpose
i
have
forbidden
adele
to
talk
to
me
about
her
presents
and
she
is
bursting
with
repletion
have
the
goodness
to
serve
her
as
auditress
and
interlocutrice
it
will
be
one
of
the
most
benevolent
acts
you
ever
performed
adele
indeed
no
sooner
saw
mrs
fairfax
than
she
summoned
her
to
her
sofa
and
there
quickly
filled
her
lap
with
the
porcelain
the
ivory
the
waxen
contents
of
her
boite
pouring
out
meantime
explanations
and
raptures
in
such
broken
english
as
she
was
mistress
of
now
i
have
performed
the
part
of
a
good
host
pursued
mr
rochester
put
my
guests
into
the
way
of
amusing
each
other
i
ought
to
be
at
liberty
to
attend
to
my
own
pleasure
miss
eyre
draw
your
chair
still
a
little
farther
forward
you
are
yet
too
far
back
i
cannot
see
you
without
disturbing
my
position
in
this
comfortable
chair
which
i
have
no
mind
to
do
i
did
as
i
was
bid
though
i
would
much
rather
have
remained
somewhat
in
the
shade
but
mr
rochester
had
such
a
direct
way
of
giving
orders
it
seemed
a
matter
of
course
to
obey
him
promptly
we
were
as
i
have
said
in
the
dining
room
the
lustre
which
had
been
lit
for
dinner
filled
the
room
with
a
festal
breadth
of
light
the
large
fire
was
all
red
and
clear
the
purple
curtains
hung
rich
and
ample
before
the
lofty
window
and
loftier
arch
everything
was
still
save
the
subdued
chat
of
adele
she
dared
not
speak
loud
and
filling
up
each
pause
the
beating
of
winter
rain
against
the
panes
mr
rochester
as
he
sat
in
his
damask
covered
chair
looked
different
to
what
i
had
seen
him
look
before
not
quite
so
stern
much
less
gloomy
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
his
eyes
sparkled
whether
with
wine
or
not
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
it
very
probable
he
was
in
short
in
his
after
dinner
mood
more
expanded
and
genial
and
also
more
self
indulgent
than
the
frigid
and
rigid
temper
of
the
morning
still
he
looked
preciously
grim
cushioning
his
massive
head
against
the
swelling
back
of
his
chair
and
receiving
the
light
of
the
fire
on
his
granite
hewn
features
and
in
his
great
dark
eyes
for
he
had
great
dark
eyes
and
very
fine
eyes
too
not
without
a
certain
change
in
their
depths
sometimes
which
if
it
was
not
softness
reminded
you
at
least
of
that
feeling
he
had
been
looking
two
minutes
at
the
fire
and
i
had
been
looking
the
same
length
of
time
at
him
when
turning
suddenly
he
caught
my
gaze
fastened
on
his
physiognomy
you
examine
me
miss
eyre
said
he
do
you
think
me
handsome
i
should
if
i
had
deliberated
have
replied
to
this
question
by
something
conventionally
vague
and
polite
but
the
answer
somehow
slipped
from
my
tongue
before
i
was
aware
no
sir
ah
by
my
word
there
is
something
singular
about
you
said
he
you
have
the
air
of
a
little
nonnette
quaint
quiet
grave
and
simple
as
you
sit
with
your
hands
before
you
and
your
eyes
generally
bent
on
the
carpet
except
by
the
bye
when
they
are
directed
piercingly
to
my
face
as
just
now
for
instance
and
when
one
asks
you
a
question
or
makes
a
remark
to
which
you
are
obliged
to
reply
you
rap
out
a
round
rejoinder
which
if
not
blunt
is
at
least
brusque
what
do
you
mean
by
it
sir
i
was
too
plain
i
beg
your
pardon
i
ought
to
have
replied
that
it
was
not
easy
to
give
an
impromptu
answer
to
a
question
about
appearances
that
tastes
mostly
differ
and
that
beauty
is
of
little
consequence
or
something
of
that
sort
you
ought
to
have
replied
no
such
thing
beauty
of
little
consequence
indeed
and
so
under
pretence
of
softening
the
previous
outrage
of
stroking
and
soothing
me
into
placidity
you
stick
a
sly
penknife
under
my
ear
go
on
what
fault
do
you
find
with
me
pray
i
suppose
i
have
all
my
limbs
and
all
my
features
like
any
other
man
mr
rochester
allow
me
to
disown
my
first
answer
i
intended
no
pointed
repartee
it
was
only
a
blunder
just
so
i
think
so
and
you
shall
be
answerable
for
it
criticise
me
does
my
forehead
not
please
you
he
lifted
up
the
sable
waves
of
hair
which
lay
horizontally
over
his
brow
and
showed
a
solid
enough
mass
of
intellectual
organs
but
an
abrupt
deficiency
where
the
suave
sign
of
benevolence
should
have
risen
now
ma
am
am
i
a
fool
far
from
it
sir
you
would
perhaps
think
me
rude
if
i
inquired
in
return
whether
you
are
a
philanthropist
there
again
another
stick
of
the
penknife
when
she
pretended
to
pat
my
head
and
that
is
because
i
said
i
did
not
like
the
society
of
children
and
old
women
low
be
it
spoken
no
young
lady
i
am
not
a
general
philanthropist
but
i
bear
a
conscience
and
he
pointed
to
the
prominences
which
are
said
to
indicate
that
faculty
and
which
fortunately
for
him
were
sufficiently
conspicuous
giving
indeed
a
marked
breadth
to
the
upper
part
of
his
head
and
besides
i
once
had
a
kind
of
rude
tenderness
of
heart
when
i
was
as
old
as
you
i
was
a
feeling
fellow
enough
partial
to
the
unfledged
unfostered
and
unlucky
but
fortune
has
knocked
me
about
since
she
has
even
kneaded
me
with
her
knuckles
and
now
i
flatter
myself
i
am
hard
and
tough
as
an
india
rubber
ball
pervious
though
through
a
chink
or
two
still
and
with
one
sentient
point
in
the
middle
of
the
lump
yes
does
that
leave
hope
for
me
hope
of
what
sir
of
my
final
re
transformation
from
india
rubber
back
to
flesh
decidedly
he
has
had
too
much
wine
i
thought
and
i
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
to
his
queer
question
how
could
i
tell
whether
he
was
capable
of
being
re
transformed
you
looked
very
much
puzzled
miss
eyre
and
though
you
are
not
pretty
any
more
than
i
am
handsome
yet
a
puzzled
air
becomes
you
besides
it
is
convenient
for
it
keeps
those
searching
eyes
of
yours
away
from
my
physiognomy
and
busies
them
with
the
worsted
flowers
of
the
rug
so
puzzle
on
young
lady
i
am
disposed
to
be
gregarious
and
communicative
to
night
with
this
announcement
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
leaning
his
arm
on
the
marble
mantelpiece
in
that
attitude
his
shape
was
seen
plainly
as
well
as
his
face
his
unusual
breadth
of
chest
disproportionate
almost
to
his
length
of
limb
i
am
sure
most
people
would
have
thought
him
an
ugly
man
yet
there
was
so
much
unconscious
pride
in
his
port
so
much
ease
in
his
demeanour
such
a
look
of
complete
indifference
to
his
own
external
appearance
so
haughty
a
reliance
on
the
power
of
other
qualities
intrinsic
or
adventitious
to
atone
for
the
lack
of
mere
personal
attractiveness
that
in
looking
at
him
one
inevitably
shared
the
indifference
and
even
in
a
blind
imperfect
sense
put
faith
in
the
confidence
i
am
disposed
to
be
gregarious
and
communicative
to
night
he
repeated
and
that
is
why
i
sent
for
you
the
fire
and
the
chandelier
were
not
sufficient
company
for
me
nor
would
pilot
have
been
for
none
of
these
can
talk
adele
is
a
degree
better
but
still
far
below
the
mark
mrs
fairfax
ditto
you
i
am
persuaded
can
suit
me
if
you
will
you
puzzled
me
the
first
evening
i
invited
you
down
here
i
have
almost
forgotten
you
since
other
ideas
have
driven
yours
from
my
head
but
to
night
i
am
resolved
to
be
at
ease
to
dismiss
what
importunes
and
recall
what
pleases
it
would
please
me
now
to
draw
you
out
to
learn
more
of
you
therefore
speak
instead
of
speaking
i
smiled
and
not
a
very
complacent
or
submissive
smile
either
speak
he
urged
what
about
sir
whatever
you
like
i
leave
both
the
choice
of
subject
and
the
manner
of
treating
it
entirely
to
yourself
accordingly
i
sat
and
said
nothing
if
he
expects
me
to
talk
for
the
mere
sake
of
talking
and
showing
off
he
will
find
he
has
addressed
himself
to
the
wrong
person
i
thought
you
are
dumb
miss
eyre
i
was
dumb
still
he
bent
his
head
a
little
towards
me
and
with
a
single
hasty
glance
seemed
to
dive
into
my
eyes
stubborn
he
said
and
annoyed
ah
it
is
consistent
i
put
my
request
in
an
absurd
almost
insolent
form
miss
eyre
i
beg
your
pardon
the
fact
is
once
for
all
i
don
t
wish
to
treat
you
like
an
inferior
that
is
correcting
himself
i
claim
only
such
superiority
as
must
result
from
twenty
years
difference
in
age
and
a
century
s
advance
in
experience
this
is
legitimate
et
j
y
tiens
as
adele
would
say
and
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
superiority
and
this
alone
that
i
desire
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
talk
to
me
a
little
now
and
divert
my
thoughts
which
are
galled
with
dwelling
on
one
point
cankering
as
a
rusty
nail
he
had
deigned
an
explanation
almost
an
apology
and
i
did
not
feel
insensible
to
his
condescension
and
would
not
seem
so
i
am
willing
to
amuse
you
if
i
can
sir
quite
willing
but
i
cannot
introduce
a
topic
because
how
do
i
know
what
will
interest
you
ask
me
questions
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
answer
them
then
in
the
first
place
do
you
agree
with
me
that
i
have
a
right
to
be
a
little
masterful
abrupt
perhaps
exacting
sometimes
on
the
grounds
i
stated
namely
that
i
am
old
enough
to
be
your
father
and
that
i
have
battled
through
a
varied
experience
with
many
men
of
many
nations
and
roamed
over
half
the
globe
while
you
have
lived
quietly
with
one
set
of
people
in
one
house
do
as
you
please
sir
that
is
no
answer
or
rather
it
is
a
very
irritating
because
a
very
evasive
one
reply
clearly
i
don
t
think
sir
you
have
a
right
to
command
me
merely
because
you
are
older
than
i
or
because
you
have
seen
more
of
the
world
than
i
have
your
claim
to
superiority
depends
on
the
use
you
have
made
of
your
time
and
experience
humph
promptly
spoken
but
i
won
t
allow
that
seeing
that
it
would
never
suit
my
case
as
i
have
made
an
indifferent
not
to
say
a
bad
use
of
both
advantages
leaving
superiority
out
of
the
question
then
you
must
still
agree
to
receive
my
orders
now
and
then
without
being
piqued
or
hurt
by
the
tone
of
command
will
you
i
smiled
i
thought
to
myself
mr
rochester
is
peculiar
he
seems
to
forget
that
he
pays
me
30
pounds
per
annum
for
receiving
his
orders
the
smile
is
very
well
said
he
catching
instantly
the
passing
expression
but
speak
too
i
was
thinking
sir
that
very
few
masters
would
trouble
themselves
to
inquire
whether
or
not
their
paid
subordinates
were
piqued
and
hurt
by
their
orders
paid
subordinates
what
you
are
my
paid
subordinate
are
you
oh
yes
i
had
forgotten
the
salary
well
then
on
that
mercenary
ground
will
you
agree
to
let
me
hector
a
little
no
sir
not
on
that
ground
but
on
the
ground
that
you
did
forget
it
and
that
you
care
whether
or
not
a
dependent
is
comfortable
in
his
dependency
i
agree
heartily
and
will
you
consent
to
dispense
with
a
great
many
conventional
forms
and
phrases
without
thinking
that
the
omission
arises
from
insolence
i
am
sure
sir
i
should
never
mistake
informality
for
insolence
one
i
rather
like
the
other
nothing
free
born
would
submit
to
even
for
a
salary
humbug
most
things
free
born
will
submit
to
anything
for
a
salary
therefore
keep
to
yourself
and
don
t
venture
on
generalities
of
which
you
are
intensely
ignorant
however
i
mentally
shake
hands
with
you
for
your
answer
despite
its
inaccuracy
and
as
much
for
the
manner
in
which
it
was
said
as
for
the
substance
of
the
speech
the
manner
was
frank
and
sincere
one
does
not
often
see
such
a
manner
no
on
the
contrary
affectation
or
coldness
or
stupid
coarse
minded
misapprehension
of
one
s
meaning
are
the
usual
rewards
of
candour
not
three
in
three
thousand
raw
school
girl
governesses
would
have
answered
me
as
you
have
just
done
but
i
don
t
mean
to
flatter
you
if
you
are
cast
in
a
different
mould
to
the
majority
it
is
no
merit
of
yours
nature
did
it
and
then
after
all
i
go
too
fast
in
my
conclusions
for
what
i
yet
know
you
may
be
no
better
than
the
rest
you
may
have
intolerable
defects
to
counterbalance
your
few
good
points
and
so
may
you
i
thought
my
eye
met
his
as
the
idea
crossed
my
mind
he
seemed
to
read
the
glance
answering
as
if
its
import
had
been
spoken
as
well
as
imagined
yes
yes
you
are
right
said
he
i
have
plenty
of
faults
of
my
own
i
know
it
and
i
don
t
wish
to
palliate
them
i
assure
you
god
wot
i
need
not
be
too
severe
about
others
i
have
a
past
existence
a
series
of
deeds
a
colour
of
life
to
contemplate
within
my
own
breast
which
might
well
call
my
sneers
and
censures
from
my
neighbours
to
myself
i
started
or
rather
for
like
other
defaulters
i
like
to
lay
half
the
blame
on
ill
fortune
and
adverse
circumstances
was
thrust
on
to
a
wrong
tack
at
the
age
of
one
and
twenty
and
have
never
recovered
the
right
course
since
but
i
might
have
been
very
different
i
might
have
been
as
good
as
you
wiser
almost
as
stainless
i
envy
you
your
peace
of
mind
your
clean
conscience
your
unpolluted
memory
little
girl
a
memory
without
blot
or
contamination
must
be
an
exquisite
treasure
an
inexhaustible
source
of
pure
refreshment
is
it
not
how
was
your
memory
when
you
were
eighteen
sir
all
right
then
limpid
salubrious
no
gush
of
bilge
water
had
turned
it
to
fetid
puddle
i
was
your
equal
at
eighteen
quite
your
equal
nature
meant
me
to
be
on
the
whole
a
good
man
miss
eyre
one
of
the
better
kind
and
you
see
i
am
not
so
you
would
say
you
don
t
see
it
at
least
i
flatter
myself
i
read
as
much
in
your
eye
beware
by
the
bye
what
you
express
with
that
organ
i
am
quick
at
interpreting
its
language
then
take
my
word
for
it
i
am
not
a
villain
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
not
to
attribute
to
me
any
such
bad
eminence
but
owing
i
verily
believe
rather
to
circumstances
than
to
my
natural
bent
i
am
a
trite
commonplace
sinner
hackneyed
in
all
the
poor
petty
dissipations
with
which
the
rich
and
worthless
try
to
put
on
life
do
you
wonder
that
i
avow
this
to
you
know
that
in
the
course
of
your
future
life
you
will
often
find
yourself
elected
the
involuntary
confidant
of
your
acquaintances
secrets
people
will
instinctively
find
out
as
i
have
done
that
it
is
not
your
forte
to
tell
of
yourself
but
to
listen
while
others
talk
of
themselves
they
will
feel
too
that
you
listen
with
no
malevolent
scorn
of
their
indiscretion
but
with
a
kind
of
innate
sympathy
not
the
less
comforting
and
encouraging
because
it
is
very
unobtrusive
in
its
manifestations
how
do
you
know
how
can
you
guess
all
this
sir
i
know
it
well
therefore
i
proceed
almost
as
freely
as
if
i
were
writing
my
thoughts
in
a
diary
you
would
say
i
should
have
been
superior
to
circumstances
so
i
should
so
i
should
but
you
see
i
was
not
when
fate
wronged
me
i
had
not
the
wisdom
to
remain
cool
i
turned
desperate
then
i
degenerated
now
when
any
vicious
simpleton
excites
my
disgust
by
his
paltry
ribaldry
i
cannot
flatter
myself
that
i
am
better
than
he
i
am
forced
to
confess
that
he
and
i
are
on
a
level
i
wish
i
had
stood
firm
god
knows
i
do
dread
remorse
when
you
are
tempted
to
err
miss
eyre
remorse
is
the
poison
of
life
repentance
is
said
to
be
its
cure
sir
it
is
not
its
cure
reformation
may
be
its
cure
and
i
could
reform
i
have
strength
yet
for
that
if
but
where
is
the
use
of
thinking
of
it
hampered
burdened
cursed
as
i
am
besides
since
happiness
is
irrevocably
denied
me
i
have
a
right
to
get
pleasure
out
of
life
and
i
will
get
it
cost
what
it
may
then
you
will
degenerate
still
more
sir
possibly
yet
why
should
i
if
i
can
get
sweet
fresh
pleasure
and
i
may
get
it
as
sweet
and
fresh
as
the
wild
honey
the
bee
gathers
on
the
moor
it
will
sting
it
will
taste
bitter
sir
how
do
you
know
you
never
tried
it
how
very
serious
how
very
solemn
you
look
and
you
are
as
ignorant
of
the
matter
as
this
cameo
head
taking
one
from
the
mantelpiece
you
have
no
right
to
preach
to
me
you
neophyte
that
have
not
passed
the
porch
of
life
and
are
absolutely
unacquainted
with
its
mysteries
i
only
remind
you
of
your
own
words
sir
you
said
error
brought
remorse
and
you
pronounced
remorse
the
poison
of
existence
and
who
talks
of
error
now
i
scarcely
think
the
notion
that
flittered
across
my
brain
was
an
error
i
believe
it
was
an
inspiration
rather
than
a
temptation
it
was
very
genial
very
soothing
i
know
that
here
it
comes
again
it
is
no
devil
i
assure
you
or
if
it
be
it
has
put
on
the
robes
of
an
angel
of
light
i
think
i
must
admit
so
fair
a
guest
when
it
asks
entrance
to
my
heart
distrust
it
sir
it
is
not
a
true
angel
once
more
how
do
you
know
by
what
instinct
do
you
pretend
to
distinguish
between
a
fallen
seraph
of
the
abyss
and
a
messenger
from
the
eternal
throne
between
a
guide
and
a
seducer
i
judged
by
your
countenance
sir
which
was
troubled
when
you
said
the
suggestion
had
returned
upon
you
i
feel
sure
it
will
work
you
more
misery
if
you
listen
to
it
not
at
all
it
bears
the
most
gracious
message
in
the
world
for
the
rest
you
are
not
my
conscience
keeper
so
don
t
make
yourself
uneasy
here
come
in
bonny
wanderer
he
said
this
as
if
he
spoke
to
a
vision
viewless
to
any
eye
but
his
own
then
folding
his
arms
which
he
had
half
extended
on
his
chest
he
seemed
to
enclose
in
their
embrace
the
invisible
being
now
he
continued
again
addressing
me
i
have
received
the
pilgrim
a
disguised
deity
as
i
verily
believe
already
it
has
done
me
good
my
heart
was
a
sort
of
charnel
it
will
now
be
a
shrine
to
speak
truth
sir
i
don
t
understand
you
at
all
i
cannot
keep
up
the
conversation
because
it
has
got
out
of
my
depth
only
one
thing
i
know
you
said
you
were
not
as
good
as
you
should
like
to
be
and
that
you
regretted
your
own
imperfection
one
thing
i
can
comprehend
you
intimated
that
to
have
a
sullied
memory
was
a
perpetual
bane
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
tried
hard
you
would
in
time
find
it
possible
to
become
what
you
yourself
would
approve
and
that
if
from
this
day
you
began
with
resolution
to
correct
your
thoughts
and
actions
you
would
in
a
few
years
have
laid
up
a
new
and
stainless
store
of
recollections
to
which
you
might
revert
with
pleasure
justly
thought
rightly
said
miss
eyre
and
at
this
moment
i
am
paving
hell
with
energy
sir
i
am
laying
down
good
intentions
which
i
believe
durable
as
flint
certainly
my
associates
and
pursuits
shall
be
other
than
they
have
been
and
better
and
better
so
much
better
as
pure
ore
is
than
foul
dross
you
seem
to
doubt
me
i
don
t
doubt
myself
i
know
what
my
aim
is
what
my
motives
are
and
at
this
moment
i
pass
a
law
unalterable
as
that
of
the
medes
and
persians
that
both
are
right
they
cannot
be
sir
if
they
require
a
new
statute
to
legalise
them
they
are
miss
eyre
though
they
absolutely
require
a
new
statute
unheard
of
combinations
of
circumstances
demand
unheard
of
rules
that
sounds
a
dangerous
maxim
sir
because
one
can
see
at
once
that
it
is
liable
to
abuse
sententious
sage
so
it
is
but
i
swear
by
my
household
gods
not
to
abuse
it
you
are
human
and
fallible
i
am
so
are
you
what
then
the
human
and
fallible
should
not
arrogate
a
power
with
which
the
divine
and
perfect
alone
can
be
safely
intrusted
what
power
that
of
saying
of
any
strange
unsanctioned
line
of
action
let
it
be
right
let
it
be
right
the
very
words
you
have
pronounced
them
may
it
be
right
then
i
said
as
i
rose
deeming
it
useless
to
continue
a
discourse
which
was
all
darkness
to
me
and
besides
sensible
that
the
character
of
my
interlocutor
was
beyond
my
penetration
at
least
beyond
its
present
reach
and
feeling
the
uncertainty
the
vague
sense
of
insecurity
which
accompanies
a
conviction
of
ignorance
where
are
you
going
to
put
adele
to
bed
it
is
past
her
bedtime
you
are
afraid
of
me
because
i
talk
like
a
sphynx
your
language
is
enigmatical
sir
but
though
i
am
bewildered
i
am
certainly
not
afraid
you
are
afraid
your
self
love
dreads
a
blunder
in
that
sense
i
do
feel
apprehensive
i
have
no
wish
to
talk
nonsense
if
you
did
it
would
be
in
such
a
grave
quiet
manner
i
should
mistake
it
for
sense
do
you
never
laugh
miss
eyre
don
t
trouble
yourself
to
answer
i
see
you
laugh
rarely
but
you
can
laugh
very
merrily
believe
me
you
are
not
naturally
austere
any
more
than
i
am
naturally
vicious
the
lowood
constraint
still
clings
to
you
somewhat
controlling
your
features
muffling
your
voice
and
restricting
your
limbs
and
you
fear
in
the
presence
of
a
man
and
a
brother
or
father
or
master
or
what
you
will
to
smile
too
gaily
speak
too
freely
or
move
too
quickly
but
in
time
i
think
you
will
learn
to
be
natural
with
me
as
i
find
it
impossible
to
be
conventional
with
you
and
then
your
looks
and
movements
will
have
more
vivacity
and
variety
than
they
dare
offer
now
i
see
at
intervals
the
glance
of
a
curious
sort
of
bird
through
the
close
set
bars
of
a
cage
a
vivid
restless
resolute
captive
is
there
were
it
but
free
it
would
soar
cloud
high
you
are
still
bent
on
going
it
has
struck
nine
sir
never
mind
wait
a
minute
adele
is
not
ready
to
go
to
bed
yet
my
position
miss
eyre
with
my
back
to
the
fire
and
my
face
to
the
room
favours
observation
while
talking
to
you
i
have
also
occasionally
watched
adele
i
have
my
own
reasons
for
thinking
her
a
curious
study
reasons
that
i
may
nay
that
i
shall
impart
to
you
some
day
she
pulled
out
of
her
box
about
ten
minutes
ago
a
little
pink
silk
frock
rapture
lit
her
face
as
she
unfolded
it
coquetry
runs
in
her
blood
blends
with
her
brains
and
seasons
the
marrow
of
her
bones
il
faut
que
je
l
essaie
cried
she
et
a
l
instant
meme
and
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
she
is
now
with
sophie
undergoing
a
robing
process
in
a
few
minutes
she
will
re
enter
and
i
know
what
i
shall
see
a
miniature
of
celine
varens
as
she
used
to
appear
on
the
boards
at
the
rising
of
but
never
mind
that
however
my
tenderest
feelings
are
about
to
receive
a
shock
such
is
my
presentiment
stay
now
to
see
whether
it
will
be
realised
ere
long
adele
s
little
foot
was
heard
tripping
across
the
hall
she
entered
transformed
as
her
guardian
had
predicted
a
dress
of
rose
coloured
satin
very
short
and
as
full
in
the
skirt
as
it
could
be
gathered
replaced
the
brown
frock
she
had
previously
worn
a
wreath
of
rosebuds
circled
her
forehead
her
feet
were
dressed
in
silk
stockings
and
small
white
satin
sandals
est
ce
que
ma
robe
va
bien
cried
she
bounding
forwards
et
mes
souliers
et
mes
bas
tenez
je
crois
que
je
vais
danser
and
spreading
out
her
dress
she
chasseed
across
the
room
till
having
reached
mr
rochester
she
wheeled
lightly
round
before
him
on
tip
toe
then
dropped
on
one
knee
at
his
feet
exclaiming
monsieur
je
vous
remercie
mille
fois
de
votre
bonte
then
rising
she
added
c
est
comme
cela
que
maman
faisait
n
est
ce
pas
monsieur
pre
cise
ly
was
the
answer
and
comme
cela
she
charmed
my
english
gold
out
of
my
british
breeches
pocket
i
have
been
green
too
miss
eyre
ay
grass
green
not
a
more
vernal
tint
freshens
you
now
than
once
freshened
me
my
spring
is
gone
however
but
it
has
left
me
that
french
floweret
on
my
hands
which
in
some
moods
i
would
fain
be
rid
of
not
valuing
now
the
root
whence
it
sprang
having
found
that
it
was
of
a
sort
which
nothing
but
gold
dust
could
manure
i
have
but
half
a
liking
to
the
blossom
especially
when
it
looks
so
artificial
as
just
now
i
keep
it
and
rear
it
rather
on
the
roman
catholic
principle
of
expiating
numerous
sins
great
or
small
by
one
good
work
i
ll
explain
all
this
some
day
good
night
chapter
xv
mr
rochester
did
on
a
future
occasion
explain
it
it
was
one
afternoon
when
he
chanced
to
meet
me
and
adele
in
the
grounds
and
while
she
played
with
pilot
and
her
shuttlecock
he
asked
me
to
walk
up
and
down
a
long
beech
avenue
within
sight
of
her
he
then
said
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
french
opera
dancer
celine
varens
towards
whom
he
had
once
cherished
what
he
called
a
grande
passion
this
passion
celine
had
professed
to
return
with
even
superior
ardour
he
thought
himself
her
idol
ugly
as
he
was
he
believed
as
he
said
that
she
preferred
his
taille
d
athlete
to
the
elegance
of
the
apollo
belvidere
and
miss
eyre
so
much
was
i
flattered
by
this
preference
of
the
gallic
sylph
for
her
british
gnome
that
i
installed
her
in
an
hotel
gave
her
a
complete
establishment
of
servants
a
carriage
cashmeres
diamonds
dentelles
c
in
short
i
began
the
process
of
ruining
myself
in
the
received
style
like
any
other
spoony
i
had
not
it
seems
the
originality
to
chalk
out
a
new
road
to
shame
and
destruction
but
trode
the
old
track
with
stupid
exactness
not
to
deviate
an
inch
from
the
beaten
centre
i
had
as
i
deserved
to
have
the
fate
of
all
other
spoonies
happening
to
call
one
evening
when
celine
did
not
expect
me
i
found
her
out
but
it
was
a
warm
night
and
i
was
tired
with
strolling
through
paris
so
i
sat
down
in
her
boudoir
happy
to
breathe
the
air
consecrated
so
lately
by
her
presence
no
i
exaggerate
i
never
thought
there
was
any
consecrating
virtue
about
her
it
was
rather
a
sort
of
pastille
perfume
she
had
left
a
scent
of
musk
and
amber
than
an
odour
of
sanctity
i
was
just
beginning
to
stifle
with
the
fumes
of
conservatory
flowers
and
sprinkled
essences
when
i
bethought
myself
to
open
the
window
and
step
out
on
to
the
balcony
it
was
moonlight
and
gaslight
besides
and
very
still
and
serene
the
balcony
was
furnished
with
a
chair
or
two
i
sat
down
and
took
out
a
cigar
i
will
take
one
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
here
ensued
a
pause
filled
up
by
the
producing
and
lighting
of
a
cigar
having
placed
it
to
his
lips
and
breathed
a
trail
of
havannah
incense
on
the
freezing
and
sunless
air
he
went
on
i
liked
bonbons
too
in
those
days
miss
eyre
and
i
was
croquant
overlook
the
barbarism
croquant
chocolate
comfits
and
smoking
alternately
watching
meantime
the
equipages
that
rolled
along
the
fashionable
streets
towards
the
neighbouring
opera
house
when
in
an
elegant
close
carriage
drawn
by
a
beautiful
pair
of
english
horses
and
distinctly
seen
in
the
brilliant
city
night
i
recognised
the
voiture
i
had
given
celine
she
was
returning
of
course
my
heart
thumped
with
impatience
against
the
iron
rails
i
leant
upon
the
carriage
stopped
as
i
had
expected
at
the
hotel
door
my
flame
that
is
the
very
word
for
an
opera
inamorata
alighted
though
muffed
in
a
cloak
an
unnecessary
encumbrance
by
the
bye
on
so
warm
a
june
evening
i
knew
her
instantly
by
her
little
foot
seen
peeping
from
the
skirt
of
her
dress
as
she
skipped
from
the
carriage
step
bending
over
the
balcony
i
was
about
to
murmur
mon
ange
in
a
tone
of
course
which
should
be
audible
to
the
ear
of
love
alone
when
a
figure
jumped
from
the
carriage
after
her
cloaked
also
but
that
was
a
spurred
heel
which
had
rung
on
the
pavement
and
that
was
a
hatted
head
which
now
passed
under
the
arched
porte
cochere
of
the
hotel
you
never
felt
jealousy
did
you
miss
eyre
of
course
not
i
need
not
ask
you
because
you
never
felt
love
you
have
both
sentiments
yet
to
experience
your
soul
sleeps
the
shock
is
yet
to
be
given
which
shall
waken
it
you
think
all
existence
lapses
in
as
quiet
a
flow
as
that
in
which
your
youth
has
hitherto
slid
away
floating
on
with
closed
eyes
and
muffled
ears
you
neither
see
the
rocks
bristling
not
far
off
in
the
bed
of
the
flood
nor
hear
the
breakers
boil
at
their
base
but
i
tell
you
and
you
may
mark
my
words
you
will
come
some
day
to
a
craggy
pass
in
the
channel
where
the
whole
of
life
s
stream
will
be
broken
up
into
whirl
and
tumult
foam
and
noise
either
you
will
be
dashed
to
atoms
on
crag
points
or
lifted
up
and
borne
on
by
some
master
wave
into
a
calmer
current
as
i
am
now
i
like
this
day
i
like
that
sky
of
steel
i
like
the
sternness
and
stillness
of
the
world
under
this
frost
i
like
thornfield
its
antiquity
its
retirement
its
old
crow
trees
and
thorn
trees
its
grey
facade
and
lines
of
dark
windows
reflecting
that
metal
welkin
and
yet
how
long
have
i
abhorred
the
very
thought
of
it
shunned
it
like
a
great
plague
house
how
i
do
still
abhor
he
ground
his
teeth
and
was
silent
he
arrested
his
step
and
struck
his
boot
against
the
hard
ground
some
hated
thought
seemed
to
have
him
in
its
grip
and
to
hold
him
so
tightly
that
he
could
not
advance
we
were
ascending
the
avenue
when
he
thus
paused
the
hall
was
before
us
lifting
his
eye
to
its
battlements
he
cast
over
them
a
glare
such
as
i
never
saw
before
or
since
pain
shame
ire
impatience
disgust
detestation
seemed
momentarily
to
hold
a
quivering
conflict
in
the
large
pupil
dilating
under
his
ebon
eyebrow
wild
was
the
wrestle
which
should
be
paramount
but
another
feeling
rose
and
triumphed
something
hard
and
cynical
self
willed
and
resolute
it
settled
his
passion
and
petrified
his
countenance
he
went
on
during
the
moment
i
was
silent
miss
eyre
i
was
arranging
a
point
with
my
destiny
she
stood
there
by
that
beech
trunk
a
hag
like
one
of
those
who
appeared
to
macbeth
on
the
heath
of
forres
you
like
thornfield
she
said
lifting
her
finger
and
then
she
wrote
in
the
air
a
memento
which
ran
in
lurid
hieroglyphics
all
along
the
house
front
between
the
upper
and
lower
row
of
windows
like
it
if
you
can
like
it
if
you
dare
i
will
like
it
said
i
i
dare
like
it
and
he
subjoined
moodily
i
will
keep
my
word
i
will
break
obstacles
to
happiness
to
goodness
yes
goodness
i
wish
to
be
a
better
man
than
i
have
been
than
i
am
as
job
s
leviathan
broke
the
spear
the
dart
and
the
habergeon
hindrances
which
others
count
as
iron
and
brass
i
will
esteem
but
straw
and
rotten
wood
adele
here
ran
before
him
with
her
shuttlecock
away
he
cried
harshly
keep
at
a
distance
child
or
go
in
to
sophie
continuing
then
to
pursue
his
walk
in
silence
i
ventured
to
recall
him
to
the
point
whence
he
had
abruptly
diverged
did
you
leave
the
balcony
sir
i
asked
when
mdlle
varens
entered
i
almost
expected
a
rebuff
for
this
hardly
well
timed
question
but
on
the
contrary
waking
out
of
his
scowling
abstraction
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
me
and
the
shade
seemed
to
clear
off
his
brow
oh
i
had
forgotten
celine
well
to
resume
when
i
saw
my
charmer
thus
come
in
accompanied
by
a
cavalier
i
seemed
to
hear
a
hiss
and
the
green
snake
of
jealousy
rising
on
undulating
coils
from
the
moonlit
balcony
glided
within
my
waistcoat
and
ate
its
way
in
two
minutes
to
my
heart
s
core
strange
he
exclaimed
suddenly
starting
again
from
the
point
strange
that
i
should
choose
you
for
the
confidant
of
all
this
young
lady
passing
strange
that
you
should
listen
to
me
quietly
as
if
it
were
the
most
usual
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
like
me
to
tell
stories
of
his
opera
mistresses
to
a
quaint
inexperienced
girl
like
you
but
the
last
singularity
explains
the
first
as
i
intimated
once
before
you
with
your
gravity
considerateness
and
caution
were
made
to
be
the
recipient
of
secrets
besides
i
know
what
sort
of
a
mind
i
have
placed
in
communication
with
my
own
i
know
it
is
one
not
liable
to
take
infection
it
is
a
peculiar
mind
it
is
a
unique
one
happily
i
do
not
mean
to
harm
it
but
if
i
did
it
would
not
take
harm
from
me
the
more
you
and
i
converse
the
better
for
while
i
cannot
blight
you
you
may
refresh
me
after
this
digression
he
proceeded
i
remained
in
the
balcony
they
will
come
to
her
boudoir
no
doubt
thought
i
let
me
prepare
an
ambush
so
putting
my
hand
in
through
the
open
window
i
drew
the
curtain
over
it
leaving
only
an
opening
through
which
i
could
take
observations
then
i
closed
the
casement
all
but
a
chink
just
wide
enough
to
furnish
an
outlet
to
lovers
whispered
vows
then
i
stole
back
to
my
chair
and
as
i
resumed
it
the
pair
came
in
my
eye
was
quickly
at
the
aperture
celine
s
chamber
maid
entered
lit
a
lamp
left
it
on
the
table
and
withdrew
the
couple
were
thus
revealed
to
me
clearly
both
removed
their
cloaks
and
there
was
the
varens
shining
in
satin
and
jewels
my
gifts
of
course
and
there
was
her
companion
in
an
officer
s
uniform
and
i
knew
him
for
a
young
roue
of
a
vicomte
a
brainless
and
vicious
youth
whom
i
had
sometimes
met
in
society
and
had
never
thought
of
hating
because
i
despised
him
so
absolutely
on
recognising
him
the
fang
of
the
snake
jealousy
was
instantly
broken
because
at
the
same
moment
my
love
for
celine
sank
under
an
extinguisher
a
woman
who
could
betray
me
for
such
a
rival
was
not
worth
contending
for
she
deserved
only
scorn
less
however
than
i
who
had
been
her
dupe
they
began
to
talk
their
conversation
eased
me
completely
frivolous
mercenary
heartless
and
senseless
it
was
rather
calculated
to
weary
than
enrage
a
listener
a
card
of
mine
lay
on
the
table
this
being
perceived
brought
my
name
under
discussion
neither
of
them
possessed
energy
or
wit
to
belabour
me
soundly
but
they
insulted
me
as
coarsely
as
they
could
in
their
little
way
especially
celine
who
even
waxed
rather
brilliant
on
my
personal
defects
deformities
she
termed
them
now
it
had
been
her
custom
to
launch
out
into
fervent
admiration
of
what
she
called
my
beaute
male
wherein
she
differed
diametrically
from
you
who
told
me
point
blank
at
the
second
interview
that
you
did
not
think
me
handsome
the
contrast
struck
me
at
the
time
and
adele
here
came
running
up
again
monsieur
john
has
just
been
to
say
that
your
agent
has
called
and
wishes
to
see
you
ah
in
that
case
i
must
abridge
opening
the
window
i
walked
in
upon
them
liberated
celine
from
my
protection
gave
her
notice
to
vacate
her
hotel
offered
her
a
purse
for
immediate
exigencies
disregarded
screams
hysterics
prayers
protestations
convulsions
made
an
appointment
with
the
vicomte
for
a
meeting
at
the
bois
de
boulogne
next
morning
i
had
the
pleasure
of
encountering
him
left
a
bullet
in
one
of
his
poor
etiolated
arms
feeble
as
the
wing
of
a
chicken
in
the
pip
and
then
thought
i
had
done
with
the
whole
crew
but
unluckily
the
varens
six
months
before
had
given
me
this
filette
adele
who
she
affirmed
was
my
daughter
and
perhaps
she
may
be
though
i
see
no
proofs
of
such
grim
paternity
written
in
her
countenance
pilot
is
more
like
me
than
she
some
years
after
i
had
broken
with
the
mother
she
abandoned
her
child
and
ran
away
to
italy
with
a
musician
or
singer
i
acknowledged
no
natural
claim
on
adele
s
part
to
be
supported
by
me
nor
do
i
now
acknowledge
any
for
i
am
not
her
father
but
hearing
that
she
was
quite
destitute
i
e
en
took
the
poor
thing
out
of
the
slime
and
mud
of
paris
and
transplanted
it
here
to
grow
up
clean
in
the
wholesome
soil
of
an
english
country
garden
mrs
fairfax
found
you
to
train
it
but
now
you
know
that
it
is
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
a
french
opera
girl
you
will
perhaps
think
differently
of
your
post
and
protegee
you
will
be
coming
to
me
some
day
with
notice
that
you
have
found
another
place
that
you
beg
me
to
look
out
for
a
new
governess
c
eh
no
adele
is
not
answerable
for
either
her
mother
s
faults
or
yours
i
have
a
regard
for
her
and
now
that
i
know
she
is
in
a
sense
parentless
forsaken
by
her
mother
and
disowned
by
you
sir
i
shall
cling
closer
to
her
than
before
how
could
i
possibly
prefer
the
spoilt
pet
of
a
wealthy
family
who
would
hate
her
governess
as
a
nuisance
to
a
lonely
little
orphan
who
leans
towards
her
as
a
friend
oh
that
is
the
light
in
which
you
view
it
well
i
must
go
in
now
and
you
too
it
darkens
but
i
stayed
out
a
few
minutes
longer
with
adele
and
pilot
ran
a
race
with
her
and
played
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
when
we
went
in
and
i
had
removed
her
bonnet
and
coat
i
took
her
on
my
knee
kept
her
there
an
hour
allowing
her
to
prattle
as
she
liked
not
rebuking
even
some
little
freedoms
and
trivialities
into
which
she
was
apt
to
stray
when
much
noticed
and
which
betrayed
in
her
a
superficiality
of
character
inherited
probably
from
her
mother
hardly
congenial
to
an
english
mind
still
she
had
her
merits
and
i
was
disposed
to
appreciate
all
that
was
good
in
her
to
the
utmost
i
sought
in
her
countenance
and
features
a
likeness
to
mr
rochester
but
found
none
no
trait
no
turn
of
expression
announced
relationship
it
was
a
pity
if
she
could
but
have
been
proved
to
resemble
him
he
would
have
thought
more
of
her
it
was
not
till
after
i
had
withdrawn
to
my
own
chamber
for
the
night
that
i
steadily
reviewed
the
tale
mr
rochester
had
told
me
as
he
had
said
there
was
probably
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
the
substance
of
the
narrative
itself
a
wealthy
englishman
s
passion
for
a
french
dancer
and
her
treachery
to
him
were
every
day
matters
enough
no
doubt
in
society
but
there
was
something
decidedly
strange
in
the
paroxysm
of
emotion
which
had
suddenly
seized
him
when
he
was
in
the
act
of
expressing
the
present
contentment
of
his
mood
and
his
newly
revived
pleasure
in
the
old
hall
and
its
environs
i
meditated
wonderingly
on
this
incident
but
gradually
quitting
it
as
i
found
it
for
the
present
inexplicable
i
turned
to
the
consideration
of
my
master
s
manner
to
myself
the
confidence
he
had
thought
fit
to
repose
in
me
seemed
a
tribute
to
my
discretion
i
regarded
and
accepted
it
as
such
his
deportment
had
now
for
some
weeks
been
more
uniform
towards
me
than
at
the
first
i
never
seemed
in
his
way
he
did
not
take
fits
of
chilling
hauteur
when
he
met
me
unexpectedly
the
encounter
seemed
welcome
he
had
always
a
word
and
sometimes
a
smile
for
me
when
summoned
by
formal
invitation
to
his
presence
i
was
honoured
by
a
cordiality
of
reception
that
made
me
feel
i
really
possessed
the
power
to
amuse
him
and
that
these
evening
conferences
were
sought
as
much
for
his
pleasure
as
for
my
benefit
i
indeed
talked
comparatively
little
but
i
heard
him
talk
with
relish
it
was
his
nature
to
be
communicative
he
liked
to
open
to
a
mind
unacquainted
with
the
world
glimpses
of
its
scenes
and
ways
i
do
not
mean
its
corrupt
scenes
and
wicked
ways
but
such
as
derived
their
interest
from
the
great
scale
on
which
they
were
acted
the
strange
novelty
by
which
they
were
characterised
and
i
had
a
keen
delight
in
receiving
the
new
ideas
he
offered
in
imagining
the
new
pictures
he
portrayed
and
following
him
in
thought
through
the
new
regions
he
disclosed
never
startled
or
troubled
by
one
noxious
allusion
the
ease
of
his
manner
freed
me
from
painful
restraint
the
friendly
frankness
as
correct
as
cordial
with
which
he
treated
me
drew
me
to
him
i
felt
at
times
as
if
he
were
my
relation
rather
than
my
master
yet
he
was
imperious
sometimes
still
but
i
did
not
mind
that
i
saw
it
was
his
way
so
happy
so
gratified
did
i
become
with
this
new
interest
added
to
life
that
i
ceased
to
pine
after
kindred
my
thin
crescent
destiny
seemed
to
enlarge
the
blanks
of
existence
were
filled
up
my
bodily
health
improved
i
gathered
flesh
and
strength
and
was
mr
rochester
now
ugly
in
my
eyes
no
reader
gratitude
and
many
associations
all
pleasurable
and
genial
made
his
face
the
object
i
best
liked
to
see
his
presence
in
a
room
was
more
cheering
than
the
brightest
fire
yet
i
had
not
forgotten
his
faults
indeed
i
could
not
for
he
brought
them
frequently
before
me
he
was
proud
sardonic
harsh
to
inferiority
of
every
description
in
my
secret
soul
i
knew
that
his
great
kindness
to
me
was
balanced
by
unjust
severity
to
many
others
he
was
moody
too
unaccountably
so
i
more
than
once
when
sent
for
to
read
to
him
found
him
sitting
in
his
library
alone
with
his
head
bent
on
his
folded
arms
and
when
he
looked
up
a
morose
almost
a
malignant
scowl
blackened
his
features
but
i
believed
that
his
moodiness
his
harshness
and
his
former
faults
of
morality
i
say
former
for
now
he
seemed
corrected
of
them
had
their
source
in
some
cruel
cross
of
fate
i
believed
he
was
naturally
a
man
of
better
tendencies
higher
principles
and
purer
tastes
than
such
as
circumstances
had
developed
education
instilled
or
destiny
encouraged
i
thought
there
were
excellent
materials
in
him
though
for
the
present
they
hung
together
somewhat
spoiled
and
tangled
i
cannot
deny
that
i
grieved
for
his
grief
whatever
that
was
and
would
have
given
much
to
assuage
it
though
i
had
now
extinguished
my
candle
and
was
laid
down
in
bed
i
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
his
look
when
he
paused
in
the
avenue
and
told
how
his
destiny
had
risen
up
before
him
and
dared
him
to
be
happy
at
thornfield
why
not
i
asked
myself
what
alienates
him
from
the
house
will
he
leave
it
again
soon
mrs
fairfax
said
he
seldom
stayed
here
longer
than
a
fortnight
at
a
time
and
he
has
now
been
resident
eight
weeks
if
he
does
go
the
change
will
be
doleful
suppose
he
should
be
absent
spring
summer
and
autumn
how
joyless
sunshine
and
fine
days
will
seem
i
hardly
know
whether
i
had
slept
or
not
after
this
musing
at
any
rate
i
started
wide
awake
on
hearing
a
vague
murmur
peculiar
and
lugubrious
which
sounded
i
thought
just
above
me
i
wished
i
had
kept
my
candle
burning
the
night
was
drearily
dark
my
spirits
were
depressed
i
rose
and
sat
up
in
bed
listening
the
sound
was
hushed
i
tried
again
to
sleep
but
my
heart
beat
anxiously
my
inward
tranquillity
was
broken
the
clock
far
down
in
the
hall
struck
two
just
then
it
seemed
my
chamber
door
was
touched
as
if
fingers
had
swept
the
panels
in
groping
a
way
along
the
dark
gallery
outside
i
said
who
is
there
nothing
answered
i
was
chilled
with
fear
all
at
once
i
remembered
that
it
might
be
pilot
who
when
the
kitchen
door
chanced
to
be
left
open
not
unfrequently
found
his
way
up
to
the
threshold
of
mr
rochester
s
chamber
i
had
seen
him
lying
there
myself
in
the
mornings
the
idea
calmed
me
somewhat
i
lay
down
silence
composes
the
nerves
and
as
an
unbroken
hush
now
reigned
again
through
the
whole
house
i
began
to
feel
the
return
of
slumber
but
it
was
not
fated
that
i
should
sleep
that
night
a
dream
had
scarcely
approached
my
ear
when
it
fled
affrighted
scared
by
a
marrow
freezing
incident
enough
this
was
a
demoniac
laugh
low
suppressed
and
deep
uttered
as
it
seemed
at
the
very
keyhole
of
my
chamber
door
the
head
of
my
bed
was
near
the
door
and
i
thought
at
first
the
goblin
laugher
stood
at
my
bedside
or
rather
crouched
by
my
pillow
but
i
rose
looked
round
and
could
see
nothing
while
as
i
still
gazed
the
unnatural
sound
was
reiterated
and
i
knew
it
came
from
behind
the
panels
my
first
impulse
was
to
rise
and
fasten
the
bolt
my
next
again
to
cry
out
who
is
there
something
gurgled
and
moaned
ere
long
steps
retreated
up
the
gallery
towards
the
third
storey
staircase
a
door
had
lately
been
made
to
shut
in
that
staircase
i
heard
it
open
and
close
and
all
was
still
was
that
grace
poole
and
is
she
possessed
with
a
devil
thought
i
impossible
now
to
remain
longer
by
myself
i
must
go
to
mrs
fairfax
i
hurried
on
my
frock
and
a
shawl
i
withdrew
the
bolt
and
opened
the
door
with
a
trembling
hand
there
was
a
candle
burning
just
outside
and
on
the
matting
in
the
gallery
i
was
surprised
at
this
circumstance
but
still
more
was
i
amazed
to
perceive
the
air
quite
dim
as
if
filled
with
smoke
and
while
looking
to
the
right
hand
and
left
to
find
whence
these
blue
wreaths
issued
i
became
further
aware
of
a
strong
smell
of
burning
something
creaked
it
was
a
door
ajar
and
that
door
was
mr
rochester
s
and
the
smoke
rushed
in
a
cloud
from
thence
i
thought
no
more
of
mrs
fairfax
i
thought
no
more
of
grace
poole
or
the
laugh
in
an
instant
i
was
within
the
chamber
tongues
of
flame
darted
round
the
bed
the
curtains
were
on
fire
in
the
midst
of
blaze
and
vapour
mr
rochester
lay
stretched
motionless
in
deep
sleep
wake
wake
i
cried
i
shook
him
but
he
only
murmured
and
turned
the
smoke
had
stupefied
him
not
a
moment
could
be
lost
the
very
sheets
were
kindling
i
rushed
to
his
basin
and
ewer
fortunately
one
was
wide
and
the
other
deep
and
both
were
filled
with
water
i
heaved
them
up
deluged
the
bed
and
its
occupant
flew
back
to
my
own
room
brought
my
own
water
jug
baptized
the
couch
afresh
and
by
god
s
aid
succeeded
in
extinguishing
the
flames
which
were
devouring
it
the
hiss
of
the
quenched
element
the
breakage
of
a
pitcher
which
i
flung
from
my
hand
when
i
had
emptied
it
and
above
all
the
splash
of
the
shower
bath
i
had
liberally
bestowed
roused
mr
rochester
at
last
though
it
was
now
dark
i
knew
he
was
awake
because
i
heard
him
fulminating
strange
anathemas
at
finding
himself
lying
in
a
pool
of
water
is
there
a
flood
he
cried
no
sir
i
answered
but
there
has
been
a
fire
get
up

are
quenched
now
i
will
fetch
you
a
candle

the
name
of
all
the
elves

christendom

that
jane
eyre

demanded
what

room

you
plotted
to
drown

cannot
too
soon

what
it

there
i
am
up
now
but
at
your
peril

a
candle

minutes
till

into
some
dry
garments

any
dry

yes
here

my
dressing
gown
now
run
i
did
run
i
brought
the
candle
which
still
remained
in
the
gallery
he
took
it
from
my
hand
held
it
up
and
surveyed
the
bed
all
blackened
and
scorched
the
sheets
drenched
the
carpet
round
swimming
in
water
what
is
it
and
who
did
it
he
asked
i
briefly
related
to
him
what
had
transpired
the
strange
laugh
i
had
heard
in
the
gallery
the
step
ascending
to
the
third
storey
the
smoke
the
smell
of
fire
which
had
conducted
me
to
his
room
in
what
state
i
had
found
matters
there
and
how
i
had
deluged
him
with
all
the
water
i
could
lay
hands
on
what
is
it
and
who
did
it
he
asked
p140
jpg
he
listened
very
gravely
his
face
as
i
went
on
expressed
more
concern
than
astonishment
he
did
not
immediately
speak
when
i
had
concluded
shall
i
call
mrs
fairfax
i
asked
mrs
fairfax
no
what
the
deuce
would
you
call
her
for
what
can
she
do
let
her
sleep
unmolested
then
i
will
fetch
leah
and
wake
john
and
his
wife
not
at
all
just
be
still
you
have
a
shawl
on
if
you
are
not
warm
enough
you
may
take
my
cloak
yonder
wrap
it
about
you
and
sit
down
in
the
arm
chair
there
i
will
put
it
on
now
place
your
feet
on
the
stool
to
keep
them
out
of
the
wet
i
am
going
to
leave
you
a
few
minutes
i
shall
take
the
candle
remain
where
you
are
till
i
return
be
as
still
as
a
mouse
i
must
pay
a
visit
to
the
second
storey
don
t
move
remember
or
call
any
one
he
went
i
watched
the
light
withdraw
he
passed
up
the
gallery
very
softly
unclosed
the
staircase
door
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
shut
it
after
him
and
the
last
ray
vanished
i
was
left
in
total
darkness
i
listened
for
some
noise
but
heard
nothing
a
very
long
time
elapsed
i
grew
weary
it
was
cold
in
spite
of
the
cloak
and
then
i
did
not
see
the
use
of
staying
as
i
was
not
to
rouse
the
house
i
was
on
the
point
of
risking
mr
rochester
s
displeasure
by
disobeying
his
orders
when
the
light
once
more
gleamed
dimly
on
the
gallery
wall
and
i
heard
his
unshod
feet
tread
the
matting
i
hope
it
is
he
thought
i
and
not
something
worse
he
re
entered
pale
and
very
gloomy
i
have
found
it
all
out
said
he
setting
his
candle
down
on
the
washstand
it
is
as
i
thought
how
sir
he
made
no
reply
but
stood
with
his
arms
folded
looking
on
the
ground
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
he
inquired
in
rather
a
peculiar
tone
i
forget
whether
you
said
you
saw
anything
when
you
opened
your
chamber
door
no
sir
only
the
candlestick
on
the
ground
but
you
heard
an
odd
laugh
you
have
heard
that
laugh
before
i
should
think
or
something
like
it
yes
sir
there
is
a
woman
who
sews
here
called
grace
poole
she
laughs
in
that
way
she
is
a
singular
person
just
so
grace
poole
you
have
guessed
it
she
is
as
you
say
singular
very
well
i
shall
reflect
on
the
subject
meantime
i
am
glad
that
you
are
the
only
person
besides
myself
acquainted
with
the
precise
details
of
to
night
s
incident
you
are
no
talking
fool
say
nothing
about
it
i
will
account
for
this
state
of
affairs
pointing
to
the
bed
and
now
return
to
your
own
room
i
shall
do
very
well
on
the
sofa
in
the
library
for
the
rest
of
the
night
it
is
near
four
in
two
hours
the
servants
will
be
up
good
night
then
sir
said
i
departing
he
seemed
surprised
very
inconsistently
so
as
he
had
just
told
me
to
go
what
he
exclaimed
are
you
quitting
me
already
and
in
that
way
you
said
i
might
go
sir
but
not
without
taking
leave
not
without
a
word
or
two
of
acknowledgment
and
good
will
not
in
short
in
that
brief
dry
fashion
why
you
have
saved
my
life
snatched
me
from
a
horrible
and
excruciating
death
and
you
walk
past
me
as
if
we
were
mutual
strangers
at
least
shake
hands
he
held
out
his
hand
i
gave
him
mine
he
took
it
first
in
one
them
in
both
his
own
you
have
saved
my
life
i
have
a
pleasure
in
owing
you
so
immense
a
debt
i
cannot
say
more
nothing
else
that
has
being
would
have
been
tolerable
to
me
in
the
character
of
creditor
for
such
an
obligation
but
you
it
is
different
i
feel
your
benefits
no
burden
jane
he
paused
gazed
at
me
words
almost
visible
trembled
on
his
lips
but
his
voice
was
checked
good
night
again
sir
there
is
no
debt
benefit
burden
obligation
in
the
case
i
knew
he
continued
you
would
do
me
good
in
some
way
at
some
time
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
when
i
first
beheld
you
their
expression
and
smile
did
not
again
he
stopped
did
not
he
proceeded
hastily
strike
delight
to
my
very
inmost
heart
so
for
nothing
people
talk
of
natural
sympathies
i
have
heard
of
good
genii
there
are
grains
of
truth
in
the
wildest
fable
my
cherished
preserver
goodnight
strange
energy
was
in
his
voice
strange
fire
in
his
look
i
am
glad
i
happened
to
be
awake
i
said
and
then
i
was
going
what
you
will
go
i
am
cold
sir
cold
yes
and
standing
in
a
pool
go
then
jane
go
but
he
still
retained
my
hand
and
i
could
not
free
it
i
bethought
myself
of
an
expedient
i
think
i
hear
mrs
fairfax
move
sir
said
i
well
leave
me
he
relaxed
his
fingers
and
i
was
gone
i
regained
my
couch
but
never
thought
of
sleep
till
morning
dawned
i
was
tossed
on
a
buoyant
but
unquiet
sea
where
billows
of
trouble
rolled
under
surges
of
joy
i
thought
sometimes
i
saw
beyond
its
wild
waters
a
shore
sweet
as
the
hills
of
beulah
and
now
and
then
a
freshening
gale
wakened
by
hope
bore
my
spirit
triumphantly
towards
the
bourne
but
i
could
not
reach
it
even
in
fancy
a
counteracting
breeze
blew
off
land
and
continually
drove
me
back
sense
would
resist
delirium
judgment
would
warn
passion
too
feverish
to
rest
i
rose
as
soon
as
day
dawned
chapter
xvi
i
both
wished
and
feared
to
see
mr
rochester
on
the
day
which
followed
this
sleepless
night
i
wanted
to
hear
his
voice
again
yet
feared
to
meet
his
eye
during
the
early
part
of
the
morning
i
momentarily
expected
his
coming
he
was
not
in
the
frequent
habit
of
entering
the
schoolroom
but
he
did
step
in
for
a
few
minutes
sometimes
and
i
had
the
impression
that
he
was
sure
to
visit
it
that
day
but
the
morning
passed
just
as
usual
nothing
happened
to
interrupt
the
quiet
course
of
adele
s
studies
only
soon
after
breakfast
i
heard
some
bustle
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mr
rochester
s
chamber
mrs
fairfax
s
voice
and
leah
s
and
the
cook
s
that
is
john
s
wife
and
even
john
s
own
gruff
tones
there
were
exclamations
of
what
a
mercy
master
was
not
burnt
in
his
bed
it
is
always
dangerous
to
keep
a
candle
lit
at
night
how
providential
that
he
had
presence
of
mind
to
think
of
the
water
jug
i
wonder
he
waked
nobody
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
will
not
take
cold
with
sleeping
on
the
library
sofa
c
to
much
confabulation
succeeded
a
sound
of
scrubbing
and
setting
to
rights
and
when
i
passed
the
room
in
going
downstairs
to
dinner
i
saw
through
the
open
door
that
all
was
again
restored
to
complete
order
only
the
bed
was
stripped
of
its
hangings
leah
stood
up
in
the
window
seat
rubbing
the
panes
of
glass
dimmed
with
smoke
i
was
about
to
address
her
for
i
wished
to
know
what
account
had
been
given
of
the
affair
but
on
advancing
i
saw
a
second
person
in
the
chamber
a
woman
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
bedside
and
sewing
rings
to
new
curtains
that
woman
was
no
other
than
grace
poole
there
she
sat
staid
and
taciturn
looking
as
usual
in
her
brown
stuff
gown
her
check
apron
white
handkerchief
and
cap
she
was
intent
on
her
work
in
which
her
whole
thoughts
seemed
absorbed
on
her
hard
forehead
and
in
her
commonplace
features
was
nothing
either
of
the
paleness
or
desperation
one
would
have
expected
to
see
marking
the
countenance
of
a
woman
who
had
attempted
murder
and
whose
intended
victim
had
followed
her
last
night
to
her
lair
and
as
i
believed
charged
her
with
the
crime
she
wished
to
perpetrate
i
was
amazed
confounded
she
looked
up
while
i
still
gazed
at
her
no
start
no
increase
or
failure
of
colour
betrayed
emotion
consciousness
of
guilt
or
fear
of
detection
she
said
good
morning
miss
in
her
usual
phlegmatic
and
brief
manner
and
taking
up
another
ring
and
more
tape
went
on
with
her
sewing
i
will
put
her
to
some
test
thought
i
such
absolute
impenetrability
is
past
comprehension
good
morning
grace
i
said
has
anything
happened
here
i
thought
i
heard
the
servants
all
talking
together
a
while
ago
only
master
had
been
reading
in
his
bed
last
night
he
fell
asleep
with
his
candle
lit
and
the
curtains
got
on
fire
but
fortunately
he
awoke
before
the
bed
clothes
or
the
wood
work
caught
and
contrived
to
quench
the
flames
with
the
water
in
the
ewer
a
strange
affair
i
said
in
a
low
voice
then
looking
at
her
fixedly
did
mr
rochester
wake
nobody
did
no
one
hear
him
move
she
again
raised
her
eyes
to
me
and
this
time
there
was
something
of
consciousness
in
their
expression
she
seemed
to
examine
me
warily
then
she
answered
the
servants
sleep
so
far
off
you
know
miss
they
would
not
be
likely
to
hear
mrs
fairfax
s
room
and
yours
are
the
nearest
to
master
s
but
mrs
fairfax
said
she
heard
nothing
when
people
get
elderly
they
often
sleep
heavy
she
paused
and
then
added
with
a
sort
of
assumed
indifference
but
still
in
a
marked
and
significant
tone
but
you
are
young
miss
and
i
should
say
a
light
sleeper
perhaps
you
may
have
heard
a
noise
i
did
said
i
dropping
my
voice
so
that
leah
who
was
still
polishing
the
panes
could
not
hear
me
and
at
first
i
thought
it
was
pilot
but
pilot
cannot
laugh
and
i
am
certain
i
heard
a
laugh
and
a
strange
one
she
took
a
new
needleful
of
thread
waxed
it
carefully
threaded
her
needle
with
a
steady
hand
and
then
observed
with
perfect
composure
it
is
hardly
likely
master
would
laugh
i
should
think
miss
when
he
was
in
such
danger
you
must
have
been
dreaming
i
was
not
dreaming
i
said
with
some
warmth
for
her
brazen
coolness
provoked
me
again
she
looked
at
me
and
with
the
same
scrutinising
and
conscious
eye
have
you
told
master
that
you
heard
a
laugh
she
inquired
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
this
morning
you
did
not
think
of
opening
your
door
and
looking
out
into
the
gallery
she
further
asked
she
appeared
to
be
cross
questioning
me
attempting
to
draw
from
me
information
unawares
the
idea
struck
me
that
if
she
discovered
i
knew
or
suspected
her
guilt
she
would
be
playing
of
some
of
her
malignant
pranks
on
me
i
thought
it
advisable
to
be
on
my
guard
on
the
contrary
said
i
i
bolted
my
door
then
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
bolting
your
door
every
night
before
you
get
into
bed
fiend
she
wants
to
know
my
habits
that
she
may
lay
her
plans
accordingly
indignation
again
prevailed
over
prudence
i
replied
sharply
hitherto
i
have
often
omitted
to
fasten
the
bolt
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
i
was
not
aware
any
danger
or
annoyance
was
to
be
dreaded
at
thornfield
hall
but
in
future
and
i
laid
marked
stress
on
the
words
i
shall
take
good
care
to
make
all
secure
before
i
venture
to
lie
down
it
will
be
wise
so
to
do
was
her
answer
this
neighbourhood
is
as
quiet
as
any
i
know
and
i
never
heard
of
the
hall
being
attempted
by
robbers
since
it
was
a
house
though
there
are
hundreds
of
pounds
worth
of
plate
in
the
plate
closet
as
is
well
known
and
you
see
for
such
a
large
house
there
are
very
few
servants
because
master
has
never
lived
here
much
and
when
he
does
come
being
a
bachelor
he
needs
little
waiting
on
but
i
always
think
it
best
to
err
on
the
safe
side
a
door
is
soon
fastened
and
it
is
as
well
to
have
a
drawn
bolt
between
one
and
any
mischief
that
may
be
about
a
deal
of
people
miss
are
for
trusting
all
to
providence
but
i
say
providence
will
not
dispense
with
the
means
though
he
often
blesses
them
when
they
are
used
discreetly
and
here
she
closed
her
harangue
a
long
one
for
her
and
uttered
with
the
demureness
of
a
quakeress
i
still
stood
absolutely
dumfoundered
at
what
appeared
to
me
her
miraculous
self
possession
and
most
inscrutable
hypocrisy
when
the
cook
entered
mrs
poole
said
she
addressing
grace
the
servants
dinner
will
soon
be
ready
will
you
come
down
no
just
put
my
pint
of
porter
and
bit
of
pudding
on
a
tray
and
i
ll
carry
it
upstairs
you
ll
have
some
meat
just
a
morsel
and
a
taste
of
cheese
that
s
all
and
the
sago
never
mind
it
at
present
i
shall
be
coming
down
before
teatime
i
ll
make
it
myself
the
cook
here
turned
to
me
saying
that
mrs
fairfax
was
waiting
for
me
so
i
departed
i
hardly
heard
mrs
fairfax
s
account
of
the
curtain
conflagration
during
dinner
so
much
was
i
occupied
in
puzzling
my
brains
over
the
enigmatical
character
of
grace
poole
and
still
more
in
pondering
the
problem
of
her
position
at
thornfield
and
questioning
why
she
had
not
been
given
into
custody
that
morning
or
at
the
very
least
dismissed
from
her
master
s
service
he
had
almost
as
much
as
declared
his
conviction
of
her
criminality
last
night
what
mysterious
cause
withheld
him
from
accusing
her
why
had
he
enjoined
me
too
to
secrecy
it
was
strange
a
bold
vindictive
and
haughty
gentleman
seemed
somehow
in
the
power
of
one
of
the
meanest
of
his
dependants
so
much
in
her
power
that
even
when
she
lifted
her
hand
against
his
life
he
dared
not
openly
charge
her
with
the
attempt
much
less
punish
her
for
it
had
grace
been
young
and
handsome
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
think
that
tenderer
feelings
than
prudence
or
fear
influenced
mr
rochester
in
her
behalf
but
hard
favoured
and
matronly
as
she
was
the
idea
could
not
be
admitted
yet
i
reflected
she
has
been
young
once
her
youth
would
be
contemporary
with
her
master
s
mrs
fairfax
told
me
once
she
had
lived
here
many
years
i
don
t
think
she
can
ever
have
been
pretty
but
for
aught
i
know
she
may
possess
originality
and
strength
of
character
to
compensate
for
the
want
of
personal
advantages
mr
rochester
is
an
amateur
of
the
decided
and
eccentric
grace
is
eccentric
at
least
what
if
a
former
caprice
a
freak
very
possible
to
a
nature
so
sudden
and
headstrong
as
his
has
delivered
him
into
her
power
and
she
now
exercises
over
his
actions
a
secret
influence
the
result
of
his
own
indiscretion
which
he
cannot
shake
off
and
dare
not
disregard
but
having
reached
this
point
of
conjecture
mrs
poole
s
square
flat
figure
and
uncomely
dry
even
coarse
face
recurred
so
distinctly
to
my
mind
s
eye
that
i
thought
no
impossible
my
supposition
cannot
be
correct
yet
suggested
the
secret
voice
which
talks
to
us
in
our
own
hearts
you
are
not
beautiful
either
and
perhaps
mr
rochester
approves
you
at
any
rate
you
have
often
felt
as
if
he
did
and
last
night
remember
his
words
remember
his
look
remember
his
voice
i
well
remembered
all
language
glance
and
tone
seemed
at
the
moment
vividly
renewed
i
was
now
in
the
schoolroom
adele
was
drawing
i
bent
over
her
and
directed
her
pencil
she
looked
up
with
a
sort
of
start
qu
avez
vous
mademoiselle
said
she
vos
doigts
tremblent
comme
la
feuille
et
vos
joues
sont
rouges
mais
rouges
comme
des
cerises
i
am
hot
adele
with
stooping
she
went
on
sketching
i
went
on
thinking
i
hastened
to
drive
from
my
mind
the
hateful
notion
i
had
been
conceiving
respecting
grace
poole
it
disgusted
me
i
compared
myself
with
her
and
found
we
were
different
bessie
leaven
had
said
i
was
quite
a
lady
and
she
spoke
truth
i
was
a
lady
and
now
i
looked
much
better
than
i
did
when
bessie
saw
me
i
had
more
colour
and
more
flesh
more
life
more
vivacity
because
i
had
brighter
hopes
and
keener
enjoyments
evening
approaches
said
i
as
i
looked
towards
the
window
i
have
never
heard
mr
rochester
s
voice
or
step
in
the
house
to
day
but
surely
i
shall
see
him
before
night
i
feared
the
meeting
in
the
morning
now
i
desire
it
because
expectation
has
been
so
long
baffled
that
it
is
grown
impatient
when
dusk
actually
closed
and
when
adele
left
me
to
go
and
play
in
the
nursery
with
sophie
i
did
most
keenly
desire
it
i
listened
for
the
bell
to
ring
below
i
listened
for
leah
coming
up
with
a
message
i
fancied
sometimes
i
heard
mr
rochester
s
own
tread
and
i
turned
to
the
door
expecting
it
to
open
and
admit
him
the
door
remained
shut
darkness
only
came
in
through
the
window
still
it
was
not
late
he
