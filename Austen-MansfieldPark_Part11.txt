chapter i

about thirty years ago miss maria ward, of huntingdon, with only seven
thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate sir thomas bertram, of
mansfield park, in the county of northampton, and to be thereby raised
to the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts and consequences
of an handsome house and large income. all huntingdon exclaimed on the
greatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her
to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it.
she had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of their
acquaintance as thought miss ward and miss frances quite as handsome as
miss maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal
advantage. but there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in
the world as there are pretty women to deserve them. miss ward, at the
end of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to be attached to
the rev. mr. norris, a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely any
private fortune, and miss frances fared yet worse. miss ward's match,
indeed, when it came to the point, was not contemptible: sir thomas
being happily able to give his friend an income in the living of
mansfield; and mr. and mrs. norris began their career of conjugal
felicity with very little less than a thousand a year. but miss frances
married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her family, and by fixing on
a lieutenant of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions, did
it very thoroughly. she could hardly have made a more untoward choice.
sir thomas bertram had interest, which, from principle as well as
pride--from a general wish of doing right, and a desire of seeing all
that were connected with him in situations of respectability, he would
have been glad to exert for the advantage of lady bertram's sister; but
her husband's profession was such as no interest could reach; and before
he had time to devise any other method of assisting them, an absolute
breach between the sisters had taken place. it was the natural result of
the conduct of each party, and such as a very imprudent marriage almost
always produces. to save herself from useless remonstrance, mrs. price
never wrote to her family on the subject till actually married. lady
bertram, who was a woman of very tranquil feelings, and a temper
remarkably easy and indolent, would have contented herself with merely
giving up her sister, and thinking no more of the matter; but mrs.
norris had a spirit of activity, which could not be satisfied till she
had written a long and angry letter to fanny, to point out the folly of
her conduct, and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences.
mrs. price, in her turn, was injured and angry; and an answer, which
comprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed such very
disrespectful reflections on the pride of sir thomas as mrs. norris
could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to all intercourse
between them for a considerable period.

their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so
distinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each
other's existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to
make it very wonderful to sir thomas that mrs. norris should ever have
it in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry
voice, that fanny had got another child. by the end of eleven years,
however, mrs. price could no longer afford to cherish pride or
resentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her.
a large and still increasing family, an husband disabled for active
service, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a very
small income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain the friends
she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed lady bertram in
a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence, such a
superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything else, as
could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. she was preparing
for her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance, and
imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she
could not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future
maintenance of the eight already in being. her eldest was a boy of ten
years old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world;
but what could she do? was there any chance of his being hereafter
useful to sir thomas in the concerns of his west indian property?
no situation would be beneath him; or what did sir thomas think of
woolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the east?

the letter was not unproductive. it re-established peace and kindness.
sir thomas sent friendly advice and professions, lady bertram dispatched
money and baby-linen, and mrs. norris wrote the letters.

such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a more
important advantage to mrs. price resulted from it. mrs. norris was
often observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister and
her family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done for her,
she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could not but
own it to be her wish that poor mrs. price should be relieved from the
charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number. "what
if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter,
a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more attention than her
poor mother could possibly give? the trouble and expense of it to them
would be nothing, compared with the benevolence of the action." lady
bertram agreed with her instantly. "i think we cannot do better," said
she; "let us send for the child."

sir thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent. he
debated and hesitated;--it was a serious charge;--a girl so brought up
must be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty instead
of kindness in taking her from her family. he thought of his own four
children, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;--but no sooner
had he deliberately begun to state his objections, than mrs. norris
interrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.

"my dear sir thomas, i perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the
generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a
piece with your general conduct; and i entirely agree with you in
the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of
providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;
and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my
mite upon such an occasion. having no children of my own, who should i
look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow, but the children
of my sisters?--and i am sure mr. norris is too just--but you know i am
a woman of few words and professions. do not let us be frightened from
a good deed by a trifle. give a girl an education, and introduce
her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of
settling well, without farther expense to anybody. a niece of ours, sir
thomas, i may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up in this
neighbourhood without many advantages. i don't say she would be so
handsome as her cousins. i dare say she would not; but she would be
introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable
circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable
establishment. you are thinking of your sons--but do not you know that,
of all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought
up as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? it is
morally impossible. i never knew an instance of it. it is, in fact, the
only sure way of providing against the connexion. suppose her a pretty
girl, and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence,
and i dare say there would be mischief. the very idea of her having been
suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect,
would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered boys in love
with her. but breed her up with them from this time, and suppose her
even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be more to
either than a sister."

"there is a great deal of truth in what you say," replied sir thomas,
"and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a
plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.
i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in,
and that to make it really serviceable to mrs. price, and creditable to
ourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged to
secure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision of
a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are so
sanguine in expecting."

"i thoroughly understand you," cried mrs. norris, "you are everything
that is generous and considerate, and i am sure we shall never disagree
on this point. whatever i can do, as you well know, i am always ready
enough to do for the good of those i love; and, though i could never
feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your
own dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own,
i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her. is not she a
sister's child? and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of
bread to give her? my dear sir thomas, with all my faults i have a warm
heart; and, poor as i am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of
life than do an ungenerous thing. so, if you are not against it, i will
write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon
as matters are settled, _i_ will engage to get the child to mansfield;
_you_ shall have no trouble about it. my own trouble, you know, i never
regard. i will send nanny to london on purpose, and she may have a bed
at her cousin the saddler's, and the child be appointed to meet her
there. they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach,
under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going. i
dare say there is always some reputable tradesman's wife or other going
up."

except to the attack on nanny's cousin, sir thomas no longer made any
objection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous
being accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,
and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. the
division of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to
have been equal; for sir thomas was fully resolved to be the real and
consistent patron of the selected child, and mrs. norris had not the
least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.
as far as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughly
benevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others;
but her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knew
quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.
having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look
forward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line of
economy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon grew
into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude which
there were no children to supply. had there been a family to provide
for, mrs. norris might never have saved her money; but having no care
of that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, or lessen the
comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never
lived up to. under this infatuating principle, counteracted by no real
affection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aim at more than
the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity; though
perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the
parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of being the
most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.

when the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully
explained; and, in reply to lady bertram's calm inquiry of "where shall
the child come to first, sister, to you or to us?" sir thomas heard with
some surprise that it would be totally out of mrs. norris's power to
take any share in the personal charge of her. he had been considering
her as a particularly welcome addition at the parsonage, as a desirable
companion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he found
himself wholly mistaken. mrs. norris was sorry to say that the little
girl's staying with them, at least as things then were, was quite out of
the question. poor mr. norris's indifferent state of health made it an
impossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a child than he could
fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his gouty complaints, it
would be a different matter: she should then be glad to take her turn,
and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just now, poor mr. norris
took up every moment of her time, and the very mention of such a thing
she was sure would distract him.

"then she had better come to us," said lady bertram, with the utmost
composure. after a short pause sir thomas added with dignity, "yes, let
her home be in this house. we will endeavour to do our duty by her, and
she will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age, and
of a regular instructress."

"very true," cried mrs. norris, "which are both very important
considerations; and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has
three girls to teach, or only two--there can be no difference. i only
wish i could be more useful; but you see i do all in my power. i am not
one of those that spare their own trouble; and nanny shall fetch her,
however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away
for three days. i suppose, sister, you will put the child in the little
white attic, near the old nurseries. it will be much the best place
for her, so near miss lee, and not far from the girls, and close by the
housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you know, and
take care of her clothes, for i suppose you would not think it fair to
expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others. indeed, i do not see
that you could possibly place her anywhere else."

lady bertram made no opposition.

"i hope she will prove a well-disposed girl," continued mrs. norris,
"and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends."

"should her disposition be really bad," said sir thomas, "we must not,
for our own children's sake, continue her in the family; but there is
no reason to expect so great an evil. we shall probably see much to wish
altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some
meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; but
these are not incurable faults; nor, i trust, can they be dangerous for
her associates. had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, i should
have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very
serious moment; but, as it is, i hope there can be nothing to fear for
_them_, and everything to hope for _her_, from the association."

"that is exactly what i think," cried mrs. norris, "and what i was
saying to my husband this morning. it will be an education for the
child, said i, only being with her cousins; if miss lee taught her
nothing, she would learn to be good and clever from _them_."

"i hope she will not tease my poor pug," said lady bertram; "i have but
just got julia to leave it alone."

"there will be some difficulty in our way, mrs. norris," observed sir
thomas, "as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls
as they grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ the
consciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of
their cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make
her remember that she is not a _miss bertram_. i should wish to see them
very good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls the
smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still they
cannot be equals. their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations will
always be different. it is a point of great delicacy, and you must
assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of
conduct."

mrs. norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreed
with him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hope
that between them it would be easily managed.

it will be readily believed that mrs. norris did not write to her sister
in vain. mrs. price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be
fixed on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer most
thankfully, assuring them of her daughter's being a very well-disposed,
good-humoured girl, and trusting they would never have cause to throw
her off. she spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny, but was
sanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air.
poor woman! she probably thought change of air might agree with many of
her children.



chapter ii

the little girl performed her long journey in safety; and at northampton
was met by mrs. norris, who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost
to welcome her, and in the importance of leading her in to the others,
and recommending her to their kindness.

fanny price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might
not be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,
nothing to disgust her relations. she was small of her age, with no glow
of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid and shy,
and shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, was not vulgar,
her voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was pretty. sir
thomas and lady bertram received her very kindly; and sir thomas,
seeing how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that was
conciliating: but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of
deportment; and lady bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or
speaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a good-humoured
smile, became immediately the less awful character of the two.

the young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the
introduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at
least on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall
of their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little
cousin. the two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in
greater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion with
rather an injudicious particularity. but they were too much used to
company and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their
confidence increasing from their cousin's total want of it, they were
soon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy
indifference.

they were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the
daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of
their age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins
in person, as education had given to their address; and no one would
have supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. there
were in fact but two years between the youngest and fanny. julia
bertram was only twelve, and maria but a year older. the little visitor
meanwhile was as unhappy as possible. afraid of everybody, ashamed of
herself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how to look
up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying. mrs. norris
had been talking to her the whole way from northampton of her wonderful
good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good
behaviour which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of misery was
therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her
not to be happy. the fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became soon no
trifling evil. in vain were the well-meant condescensions of sir thomas,
and all the officious prognostications of mrs. norris that she would be
a good girl; in vain did lady bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa
with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart
towards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls
before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her likeliest
friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.

"this is not a very promising beginning," said mrs. norris, when fanny
had left the room. "after all that i said to her as we came along, i
thought she would have behaved better; i told her how much might depend
upon her acquitting herself well at first. i wish there may not be a
little sulkiness of temper--her poor mother had a good deal; but we must
make allowances for such a child--and i do not know that her being sorry
to leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults,
it _was_ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has
changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things."

it required a longer time, however, than mrs. norris was inclined to
allow, to reconcile fanny to the novelty of mansfield park, and the
separation from everybody she had been used to. her feelings were very
acute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. nobody
meant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure
her comfort.

the holiday allowed to the miss bertrams the next day, on purpose to
afford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their young
cousin, produced little union. they could not but hold her cheap on
finding that she had but two sashes, and had never learned french; and
when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were so
good as to play, they could do no more than make her a generous present
of some of their least valued toys, and leave her to herself, while
they adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of the
moment, making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.

fanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in the schoolroom, the
drawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding something
to fear in every person and place. she was disheartened by lady
bertram's silence, awed by sir thomas's grave looks, and quite overcome
by mrs. norris's admonitions. her elder cousins mortified her by
reflections on her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: miss
lee wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her
clothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers
and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow,
instructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her little heart was
severe.

the grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her. the
rooms were too large for her to move in with ease: whatever she touched
she expected to injure, and she crept about in constant terror of
something or other; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry; and
the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left it
at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune,
ended every day's sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. a week had
passed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet
passive manner, when she was found one morning by her cousin edmund, the
youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.

"my dear little cousin," said he, with all the gentleness of an
excellent nature, "what can be the matter?" and sitting down by her,
he was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised, and
persuade her to speak openly. was she ill? or was anybody angry with
her? or had she quarrelled with maria and julia? or was she puzzled
about anything in her lesson that he could explain? did she, in short,
want anything he could possibly get her, or do for her? for a long while
no answer could be obtained beyond a "no, no--not at all--no, thank
you"; but he still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to revert
to her own home, than her increased sobs explained to him where the
grievance lay. he tried to console her.

"you are sorry to leave mama, my dear little fanny," said he, "which
shows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are
with relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you
happy. let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about your
brothers and sisters."

on pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all these brothers and
sisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in her
thoughts than the rest. it was william whom she talked of most, and
wanted most to see. william, the eldest, a year older than herself, her
constant companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whom
he was the darling) in every distress. "william did not like she should
come away; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed." "but
william will write to you, i dare say." "yes, he had promised he would,
but he had told _her_ to write first." "and when shall you do it?" she
hung her head and answered hesitatingly, "she did not know; she had not
any paper."

"if that be all your difficulty, i will furnish you with paper and every
other material, and you may write your letter whenever you choose. would
it make you happy to write to william?"

"yes, very."

"then let it be done now. come with me into the breakfast-room, we shall
find everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves."

"but, cousin, will it go to the post?"

"yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and,
as your uncle will frank it, it will cost william nothing."

"my uncle!" repeated fanny, with a frightened look.

"yes, when you have written the letter, i will take it to my father to
frank."

fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; and
they went together into the breakfast-room, where edmund prepared her
paper, and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother
could himself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. he
continued with her the whole time of her writing, to assist her with his
penknife or his orthography, as either were wanted; and added to these
attentions, which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother which
delighted her beyond all the rest. he wrote with his own hand his
love to his cousin william, and sent him half a guinea under the seal.
fanny's feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself
incapable of expressing; but her countenance and a few artless words
fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin began
to find her an interesting object. he talked to her more, and, from all
that she said, was convinced of her having an affectionate heart, and
a strong desire of doing right; and he could perceive her to be farther
entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation, and great
timidity. he had never knowingly given her pain, but he now felt that
she required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured,
in the first place, to lessen her fears of them all, and gave her
especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with maria and
julia, and being as merry as possible.

from this day fanny grew more comfortable. she felt that she had a
friend, and the kindness of her cousin edmund gave her better spirits
with everybody else. the place became less strange, and the people less
formidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease
to fear, she began at least to know their ways, and to catch the best
manner of conforming to them. the little rusticities and awkwardnesses
which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all,
and not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she was no longer
materially afraid to appear before her uncle, nor did her aunt norris's
voice make her start very much. to her cousins she became occasionally
an acceptable companion. though unworthy, from inferiority of age and
strength, to be their constant associate, their pleasures and schemes
were sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful, especially when
that third was of an obliging, yielding temper; and they could not but
own, when their aunt inquired into her faults, or their brother edmund
urged her claims to their kindness, that "fanny was good-natured
enough."

edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endure
on the part of tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of
seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten. he was just
entering into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal
dispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only for expense and
enjoyment. his kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his
situation and rights: he made her some very pretty presents, and laughed
at her.

as her appearance and spirits improved, sir thomas and mrs. norris
thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it
was pretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she
showed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little
trouble. a mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_.
fanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught nothing more;
and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had
been long familiar, they thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the
first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of
it into the drawing-room. "dear mama, only think, my cousin cannot
put the map of europe together--or my cousin cannot tell the principal
rivers in russia--or, she never heard of asia minor--or she does
not know the difference between water-colours and crayons!--how
strange!--did you ever hear anything so stupid?"

"my dear," their considerate aunt would reply, "it is very bad, but
you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as
yourself."

"but, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!--do you know, we asked her
last night which way she would go to get to ireland; and she said, she
should cross to the isle of wight. she thinks of nothing but the isle of
wight, and she calls it _the_ _island_, as if there were no other island
in the world. i am sure i should have been ashamed of myself, if i had
not known better long before i was so old as she is. i cannot remember
the time when i did not know a great deal that she has not the least
notion of yet. how long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat the
chronological order of the kings of england, with the dates of their
accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!"

"yes," added the other; "and of the roman emperors as low as severus;
besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,
semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers."

"very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful
memories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. there is a
vast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else,
and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her
deficiency. and remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever
yourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already,
there is a great deal more for you to learn."

"yes, i know there is, till i am seventeen. but i must tell you another
thing of fanny, so odd and so stupid. do you know, she says she does not
want to learn either music or drawing."

"to be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great
want of genius and emulation. but, all things considered, i do not know
whether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know
(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with
you, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as
you are;--on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should
be a difference."

such were the counsels by which mrs. norris assisted to form her nieces'
minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their promising
talents and early information, they should be entirely deficient in the
less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity and humility. in
everything but disposition they were admirably taught. sir thomas did
not know what was wanting, because, though a truly anxious father, he
was not outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of his manner repressed
all the flow of their spirits before him.

to the education of her daughters lady bertram paid not the smallest
attention. she had not time for such cares. she was a woman who spent
her days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece of
needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pug than
her children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put
herself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by sir thomas,
and in smaller concerns by her sister. had she possessed greater leisure
for the service of her girls, she would probably have supposed it
unnecessary, for they were under the care of a governess, with proper
masters, and could want nothing more. as for fanny's being stupid at
learning, "she could only say it was very unlucky, but some people
_were_ stupid, and fanny must take more pains: she did not know what
else was to be done; and, except her being so dull, she must add she saw
no harm in the poor little thing, and always found her very handy and
quick in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted."

fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at
mansfield park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her
attachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among her
cousins. there was no positive ill-nature in maria or julia; and though
fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her, she thought too
lowly of her own claims to feel injured by it.

from about the time of her entering the family, lady bertram, in
consequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave
up the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring,
and remained wholly in the country, leaving sir thomas to attend his
duty in parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort
might arise from her absence. in the country, therefore, the miss
bertrams continued to exercise their memories, practise their duets,
and grow tall and womanly: and their father saw them becoming in person,
manner, and accomplishments, everything that could satisfy his anxiety.
his eldest son was careless and extravagant, and had already given him
much uneasiness; but his other children promised him nothing but good.
his daughters, he felt, while they retained the name of bertram, must
be giving it new grace, and in quitting it, he trusted, would extend
its respectable alliances; and the character of edmund, his strong good
sense and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for utility, honour, and
happiness to himself and all his connexions. he was to be a clergyman.

amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested,
sir thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of mrs.
price: he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her
sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and fanny,
though almost totally separated from her family, was sensible of the
truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of
anything at all promising in their situation or conduct. once, and once
only, in the course of many years, had she the happiness of being with
william. of the rest she saw nothing: nobody seemed to think of her ever
going amongst them again, even for a visit, nobody at home seemed to
want her; but william determining, soon after her removal, to be a
sailor, was invited to spend a week with his sister in northamptonshire
before he went to sea. their eager affection in meeting, their exquisite
delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, and moments of
serious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguine views and
spirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of the girl when he
left her. luckily the visit happened in the christmas holidays, when she
could directly look for comfort to her cousin edmund; and he told her
such charming things of what william was to do, and be hereafter, in
consequence of his profession, as made her gradually admit that the
separation might have some use. edmund's friendship never failed her:
his leaving eton for oxford made no change in his kind dispositions, and
only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them. without any
display of doing more than the rest, or any fear of doing too much,
he was always true to her interests, and considerate of her feelings,
trying to make her good qualities understood, and to conquer the
diffidence which prevented their being more apparent; giving her advice,
consolation, and encouragement.

kept back as she was by everybody else, his single support could not
bring her forward; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest
importance in assisting the improvement of her mind, and extending its
pleasures. he knew her to be clever, to have a quick apprehension
as well as good sense, and a fondness for reading, which, properly
directed, must be an education in itself. miss lee taught her french,
and heard her read the daily portion of history; but he recommended
the books which charmed her leisure hours, he encouraged her taste, and
corrected her judgment: he made reading useful by talking to her of what
she read, and heightened its attraction by judicious praise. in return
for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except
william: her heart was divided between the two.



chapter iii

the first event of any importance in the family was the death of mr.
norris, which happened when fanny was about fifteen, and necessarily
introduced alterations and novelties. mrs. norris, on quitting the
parsonage, removed first to the park, and afterwards to a small house
of sir thomas's in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of her
husband by considering that she could do very well without him; and for
her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy.

the living was hereafter for edmund; and, had his uncle died a few years
sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he
were old enough for orders. but tom's extravagance had, previous to
that event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next
presentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for the
pleasures of the elder. there was another family living actually held
for edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement
somewhat easier to sir thomas's conscience, he could not but feel it to
be an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son
with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better effect
than anything he had yet been able to say or do.

"i blush for you, tom," said he, in his most dignified manner; "i blush
for the expedient which i am driven on, and i trust i may pity your
feelings as a brother on the occasion. you have robbed edmund for ten,
twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income
which ought to be his. it may hereafter be in my power, or in yours
(i hope it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not
be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his
natural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent
for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the
urgency of your debts."

tom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quickly as
possible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly, that he
had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends; secondly, that
his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it; and,
thirdly, that the future incumbent, whoever he might be, would, in all
probability, die very soon.

on mr. norris's death the presentation became the right of a dr. grant,
who came consequently to reside at mansfield; and on proving to be a
hearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint mr. bertram's
calculations. but "no, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of fellow,
and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off."

he had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children; and
they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very
respectable, agreeable people.

the time was now come when sir thomas expected his sister-in-law to
claim her share in their niece, the change in mrs. norris's situation,
and the improvement in fanny's age, seeming not merely to do away any
former objection to their living together, but even to give it the most
decided eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less
fair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his west india estate, in
addition to his eldest son's extravagance, it became not undesirable
to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and the
obligation of her future provision. in the fullness of his belief that
such a thing must be, he mentioned its probability to his wife; and the
first time of the subject's occurring to her again happening to be when
fanny was present, she calmly observed to her, "so, fanny, you are going
to leave us, and live with my sister. how shall you like it?"

fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt's words,
"going to leave you?"

"yes, my dear; why should you be astonished? you have been five years
with us, and my sister always meant to take you when mr. norris died.
but you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same."

the news was as disagreeable to fanny as it had been unexpected. she had
never received kindness from her aunt norris, and could not love her.

"i shall be very sorry to go away," said she, with a faltering voice.

"yes, i dare say you will; _that's_ natural enough. i suppose you have
had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature
in the world."

"i hope i am not ungrateful, aunt," said fanny modestly.

"no, my dear; i hope not. i have always found you a very good girl."

"and am i never to live here again?"

"never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. it can make
very little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the
other."

fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the
difference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt
with anything like satisfaction. as soon as she met with edmund she told
him her distress.

"cousin," said she, "something is going to happen which i do not like
at all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to
things that i disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. i am
going to live entirely with my aunt norris."

"indeed!"

"yes; my aunt bertram has just told me so. it is quite settled. i am to
leave mansfield park, and go to the white house, i suppose, as soon as
she is removed there."

"well, fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, i should call
it an excellent one."

"oh, cousin!"

"it has everything else in its favour. my aunt is acting like a sensible
woman in wishing for you. she is choosing a friend and companion exactly
where she ought, and i am glad her love of money does not interfere.
you will be what you ought to be to her. i hope it does not distress you
very much, fanny?"

"indeed it does: i cannot like it. i love this house and everything in
it: i shall love nothing there. you know how uncomfortable i feel with
her."

"i can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was the
same with us all, or nearly so. she never knew how to be pleasant to
children. but you are now of an age to be treated better; i think she is
behaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you _must_
be important to her."

"i can never be important to any one."

"what is to prevent you?"

"everything. my situation, my foolishness and awkwardness."

"as to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear fanny, believe me, you
never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.
there is no reason in the world why you should not be important where
you are known. you have good sense, and a sweet temper, and i am sure
you have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without
wishing to return it. i do not know any better qualifications for a
friend and companion."

"you are too kind," said fanny, colouring at such praise; "how shall i
ever thank you as i ought, for thinking so well of me. oh! cousin, if i
am to go away, i shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my
life."

"why, indeed, fanny, i should hope to be remembered at such a distance
as the white house. you speak as if you were going two hundred miles
off instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost
as much as ever. the two families will be meeting every day in the
year. the only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will
necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be. _here_ there are
too many whom you can hide behind; but with _her_ you will be forced to
speak for yourself."

"oh! i do not say so."

"i must say it, and say it with pleasure. mrs. norris is much better
fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. she is of a
temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself
about, and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers."

fanny sighed, and said, "i cannot see things as you do; but i ought to
believe you to be right rather than myself, and i am very much obliged
to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. if i could suppose
my aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of
consequence to anybody. _here_, i know, i am of none, and yet i love the
place so well."

"the place, fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the house.
you will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever. even
_your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal
change. you will have the same walks to frequent, the same library to
choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse to ride."

"very true. yes, dear old grey pony! ah! cousin, when i remember how
much i used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked
of as likely to do me good (oh! how i have trembled at my uncle's
opening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind
pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince
me that i should like it after a little while, and feel how right you
proved to be, i am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well."

"and i am quite convinced that your being with mrs. norris will be as
good for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for
your ultimate happiness too."

so ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it
could render fanny, might as well have been spared, for mrs. norris had
not the smallest intention of taking her. it had never occurred to her,
on the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. to
prevent its being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation
which could rank as genteel among the buildings of mansfield parish,
the white house being only just large enough to receive herself and her
servants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she made a
very particular point. the spare rooms at the parsonage had never been
wanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now
never forgotten. not all her precautions, however, could save her from
being suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display of
the importance of a spare room might have misled sir thomas to suppose
it really intended for fanny. lady bertram soon brought the matter to a
certainty by carelessly observing to mrs. norris--

"i think, sister, we need not keep miss lee any longer, when fanny goes
to live with you."

mrs. norris almost started. "live with me, dear lady bertram! what do
you mean?"

"is she not to live with you? i thought you had settled it with sir
thomas."

"me! never. i never spoke a syllable about it to sir thomas, nor he to
me. fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think
of, or for anybody to wish that really knows us both. good heaven! what
could i do with fanny? me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for
anything, my spirits quite broke down; what could i do with a girl at
her time of life? a girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to need
most attention and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test!
sure sir thomas could not seriously expect such a thing! sir thomas is
too much my friend. nobody that wishes me well, i am sure, would propose
it. how came sir thomas to speak to you about it?"

"indeed, i do not know. i suppose he thought it best."

"but what did he say? he could not say he _wished_ me to take fanny. i
am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it."

"no; he only said he thought it very likely; and i thought so too. we
both thought it would be a comfort to you. but if you do not like it,
there is no more to be said. she is no encumbrance here."

"dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she be any
comfort to me? here am i, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best of
husbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits still
worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to
support me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as not
to disgrace the memory of the dear departed--what possible comfort could
i have in taking such a charge upon me as fanny? if i could wish it for
my own sake, i would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl. she
is in good hands, and sure of doing well. i must struggle through my
sorrows and difficulties as i can."

"then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?"

"lady bertram, i do not complain. i know i cannot live as i have done,
but i must retrench where i can, and learn to be a better manager. i
_have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough, but i shall not be ashamed
to practise economy now. my situation is as much altered as my income.
a great many things were due from poor mr. norris, as clergyman of the
parish, that cannot be expected from me. it is unknown how much was
consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. at the white house,
matters must be better looked after. i _must_ live within my income, or
i shall be miserable; and i own it would give me great satisfaction to
be able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year."

"i dare say you will. you always do, don't you?"

"my object, lady bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me.
it is for your children's good that i wish to be richer. i have nobody
else to care for, but i should be very glad to think i could leave a
little trifle among them worth their having."

"you are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. they are
sure of being well provided for. sir thomas will take care of that."

"why, you know, sir thomas's means will be rather straitened if the
antigua estate is to make such poor returns."

"oh! _that_ will soon be settled. sir thomas has been writing about it,
i know."

"well, lady bertram," said mrs. norris, moving to go, "i can only say
that my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if sir
thomas should ever speak again about my taking fanny, you will be able
to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;
besides that, i really should not have a bed to give her, for i must
keep a spare room for a friend."

lady bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to
convince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law's views; and
she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the
slightest allusion to it from him. he could not but wonder at her
refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to
adopt; but, as she took early care to make him, as well as lady bertram,
understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family,
he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the same time that it
was advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable him better to
provide for fanny himself.

fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal;
and her spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some
consolation to edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to
be so essentially serviceable to her. mrs. norris took possession of the
white house, the grants arrived at the parsonage, and these events over,
everything at mansfield went on for some time as usual.

the grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gave great
satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance. they had their
faults, and mrs. norris soon found them out. the doctor was very fond of
eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and mrs. grant, instead
of contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as high
wages as they did at mansfield park, and was scarcely ever seen in her
offices. mrs. norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances,
nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed
in the house. "nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself;
nobody more hated pitiful doings; the parsonage, she believed, had never
been wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad character
in _her_ _time_, but this was a way of going on that she could not
understand. a fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place.
_her_ store-room, she thought, might have been good enough for mrs.
grant to go into. inquire where she would, she could not find out that
mrs. grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds."

lady bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective.
she could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she felt all
the injuries of beauty in mrs. grant's being so well settled in life
without being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that point
almost as often, though not so diffusely, as mrs. norris discussed the
other.

these opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event
arose of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim some place
in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies. sir thomas found it
expedient to go to antigua himself, for the better arrangement of his
affairs, and he took his eldest son with him, in the hope of detaching
him from some bad connexions at home. they left england with the
probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent.

the necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its
utility to his son, reconciled sir thomas to the effort of quitting the
rest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction of
others at their present most interesting time of life. he could not
think lady bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or rather,
to perform what should have been her own; but, in mrs. norris's watchful
attention, and in edmund's judgment, he had sufficient confidence to
make him go without fears for their conduct.

lady bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her; but she
was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety, or solicitude for his
comfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous,
or difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.

the miss bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for their
sorrow, but for their want of it. their father was no object of love to
them; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his absence
was unhappily most welcome. they were relieved by it from all restraint;
and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been
forbidden by sir thomas, they felt themselves immediately at their
own disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach. fanny's
relief, and her consciousness of it, were quite equal to her cousins';
but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful,
and she really grieved because she could not grieve. "sir thomas, who
had done so much for her and her brothers, and who was gone perhaps
never to return! that she should see him go without a tear! it was a
shameful insensibility." he had said to her, moreover, on the very last
morning, that he hoped she might see william again in the course of the
ensuing winter, and had charged her to write and invite him to mansfield
as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be
in england. "this was so thoughtful and kind!" and would he only have
smiled upon her, and called her "my dear fanny," while he said it, every
former frown or cold address might have been forgotten. but he had ended
his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification, by adding, "if
william does come to mansfield, i hope you may be able to convince him
that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been
spent on your side entirely without improvement; though, i fear, he must
find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at
ten." she cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was
gone; and her cousins, on seeing her with red eyes, set her down as a
hypocrite.



chapter iv

tom bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he
could be only nominally missed; and lady bertram was soon astonished
to find how very well they did even without his father, how well edmund
could supply his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing to
the attorney, settling with the servants, and equally saving her
from all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of
directing her letters.

the earliest intelligence of the travellers' safe arrival at antigua,
after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before mrs. norris
had been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make edmund
participate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended
on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,
she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,
when sir thomas's assurances of their both being alive and well made it
necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches
for a while.

the winter came and passed without their being called for; the accounts
continued perfectly good; and mrs. norris, in promoting gaieties for her
nieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,
and looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, in
addition to all her own household cares, some interference in those of
her sister, and mrs. grant's wasteful doings to overlook, left her very
little occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.

the miss bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the
neighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements
a manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility and
obligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration. their
vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it,
and gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending such behaviour,
secured and brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them in
believing they had no faults.

lady bertram did not go into public with her daughters. she was too
indolent even to accept a mother's gratification in witnessing their
success and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble, and the
charge was made over to her sister, who desired nothing better than a
post of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly relished
the means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to
hire.

fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyed
being avowedly useful as her aunt's companion when they called away the
rest of the family; and, as miss lee had left mansfield, she naturally
became everything to lady bertram during the night of a ball or a party.
she talked to her, listened to her, read to her; and the tranquillity
of such evenings, her perfect security in such a _tete-a-tete_ from any
sound of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom
known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments. as to her cousins'
gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them, especially of the
balls, and whom edmund had danced with; but thought too lowly of her
own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same, and
listened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them. upon
the whole, it was a comfortable winter to her; for though it brought
no william to england, the never-failing hope of his arrival was worth
much.

the ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend, the old grey pony;
and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as
well as in her affections; for in spite of the acknowledged importance
of her riding on horse-back, no measures were taken for mounting her
again, "because," as it was observed by her aunts, "she might ride one
of her cousin's horses at any time when they did not want them," and as
the miss bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day, and had
no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real
pleasure, that time, of course, never came. they took their cheerful
rides in the fine mornings of april and may; and fanny either sat at
home the whole day with one aunt, or walked beyond her strength at
the instigation of the other: lady bertram holding exercise to be as
unnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant to herself; and mrs.
norris, who was walking all day, thinking everybody ought to walk
as much. edmund was absent at this time, or the evil would have
been earlier remedied. when he returned, to understand how fanny was
situated, and perceived its ill effects, there seemed with him but one
thing to be done; and that "fanny must have a horse" was the resolute
declaration with which he opposed whatever could be urged by the
supineness of his mother, or the economy of his aunt, to make it appear
unimportant. mrs. norris could not help thinking that some steady old
thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the park that would
do vastly well; or that one might be borrowed of the steward; or that
perhaps dr. grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the
post. she could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary, and even
improper, that fanny should have a regular lady's horse of her own, in
the style of her cousins. she was sure sir thomas had never intended it:
and she must say that, to be making such a purchase in his absence, and
adding to the great expenses of his stable, at a time when a large part
of his income was unsettled, seemed to her very unjustifiable. "fanny
must have a horse," was edmund's only reply. mrs. norris could not see
it in the same light. lady bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son
as to the necessity of it, and as to its being considered necessary by
his father; she only pleaded against there being any hurry; she only
wanted him to wait till sir thomas's return, and then sir thomas might
settle it all himself. he would be at home in september, and where would
be the harm of only waiting till september?

though edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his
mother, as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help paying
more attention to what she said; and at length determined on a method of
proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father's thinking he
had done too much, and at the same time procure for fanny the immediate
means of exercise, which he could not bear she should be without. he had
three horses of his own, but not one that would carry a woman. two
of them were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third he
resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride; he knew where
such a one was to be met with; and having once made up his mind, the
whole business was soon completed. the new mare proved a treasure; with
a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose,
and fanny was then put in almost full possession of her. she had not
supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old grey
pony; but her delight in edmund's mare was far beyond any former
pleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in the
consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, was
beyond all her words to express. she regarded her cousin as an example
of everything good and great, as possessing worth which no one but
herself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude from
her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay. her sentiments towards
him were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful, confiding, and
tender.

as the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of edmund,
mrs. norris could tolerate its being for fanny's use; and had lady
bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have
been excused in her eyes for not waiting till sir thomas's return in
september, for when september came sir thomas was still abroad, and
without any near prospect of finishing his business. unfavourable
circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to
turn all his thoughts towards england; and the very great uncertainty
in which everything was then involved determined him on sending home his
son, and waiting the final arrangement by himself. tom arrived safely,
bringing an excellent account of his father's health; but to very little
purpose, as far as mrs. norris was concerned. sir thomas's sending away
his son seemed to her so like a parent's care, under the influence of a
foreboding of evil to himself, that she could not help feeling dreadful
presentiments; and as the long evenings of autumn came on, was so
terribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness of her cottage,
as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room of the park.
the return of winter engagements, however, was not without its effect;
and in the course of their progress, her mind became so pleasantly
occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece, as
tolerably to quiet her nerves. "if poor sir thomas were fated never to
return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear maria well
married," she very often thought; always when they were in the company
of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a young man
who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest
places in the country.

mr. rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of miss bertram,
and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love. he was
a heavy young man, with not more than common sense; but as there was
nothing disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady was well
pleased with her conquest. being now in her twenty-first year, maria
bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage with
mr. rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her
father's, as well as ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime
object, it became, by the same rule of moral obligation, her evident
duty to marry mr. rushworth if she could. mrs. norris was most zealous
in promoting the match, by every suggestion and contrivance likely to
enhance its desirableness to either party; and, among other means, by
seeking an intimacy with the gentleman's mother, who at present lived
with him, and to whom she even forced lady bertram to go through ten
miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit. it was not long before
a good understanding took place between this lady and herself. mrs.
rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry,
and declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen, miss
bertram seemed, by her amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best
adapted to make him happy. mrs. norris accepted the compliment,
and admired the nice discernment of character which could so well
distinguish merit. maria was indeed the pride and delight of them
all--perfectly faultless--an angel; and, of course, so surrounded by
admirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, as far as mrs.
norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance, mr.
rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her.

after dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young
people justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference
to the absent sir thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction
of their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the
neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of mr.
rushworth's marrying miss bertram.

it was some months before sir thomas's consent could be received; but,
in the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure
in the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried
on without restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than mrs.
norris's talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at
present.

edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the
business; but no representation of his aunt's could induce him to find
mr. rushworth a desirable companion. he could allow his sister to be
the best judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that her
happiness should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain from
often saying to himself, in mr. rushworth's company--"if this man had
not twelve thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow."

sir thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance
so unquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but the
perfectly good and agreeable. it was a connexion exactly of the right
sort--in the same county, and the same interest--and his most hearty
concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible. he only conditioned that
the marriage should not take place before his return, which he was again
looking eagerly forward to. he wrote in april, and had strong hopes
of settling everything to his entire satisfaction, and leaving antigua
before the end of the summer.

such was the state of affairs in the month of july; and fanny had just
reached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received
an addition in the brother and sister of mrs. grant, a mr. and miss
crawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage. they were
young people of fortune. the son had a good estate in norfolk, the
daughter twenty thousand pounds. as children, their sister had been
always very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon
followed by the death of their common parent, which left them to the
care of a brother of their father, of whom mrs. grant knew nothing, she
had scarcely seen them since. in their uncle's house they had found a
kind home. admiral and mrs. crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,
were united in affection for these children, or, at least, were no
farther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite, to
whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two. the admiral delighted
in the boy, mrs. crawford doted on the girl; and it was the lady's death
which now obliged her _protegee_, after some months' further trial at
her uncle's house, to find another home. admiral crawford was a man of
vicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining his niece, to bring his
mistress under his own roof; and to this mrs. grant was indebted for her
sister's proposal of coming to her, a measure quite as welcome on one
side as it could be expedient on the other; for mrs. grant, having by
this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the
country without a family of children--having more than filled her
favourite sitting-room with pretty furniture, and made a choice
collection of plants and poultry--was very much in want of some variety
at home. the arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she had always loved,
and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained single, was
highly agreeable; and her chief anxiety was lest mansfield should not
satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to london.

miss crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, though
they arose principally from doubts of her sister's style of living and
tone of society; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to
persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house,
that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations. to
anything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, henry
crawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate his
sister in an article of such importance; but he escorted her, with the
utmost kindness, into northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch
her away again, at half an hour's notice, whenever she were weary of the
place.

the meeting was very satisfactory on each side. miss crawford found a
sister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister's husband who looked
the gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and mrs. grant
received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man
and woman of very prepossessing appearance. mary crawford was remarkably
pretty; henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance; the manners
of both were lively and pleasant, and mrs. grant immediately gave them
credit for everything else. she was delighted with each, but mary was
her dearest object; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her
own, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister's.
she had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her:
she had fixed on tom bertram; the eldest son of a baronet was not too
good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds, with all the elegance
and accomplishments which mrs. grant foresaw in her; and being a
warm-hearted, unreserved woman, mary had not been three hours in the
house before she told her what she had planned.

miss crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near
them, and not at all displeased either at her sister's early care, or
the choice it had fallen on. matrimony was her object, provided she
could marry well: and having seen mr. bertram in town, she knew that
objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in
life. while she treated it as a joke, therefore, she did not forget to
think of it seriously. the scheme was soon repeated to henry.

"and now," added mrs. grant, "i have thought of something to make it
complete. i should dearly love to settle you both in this country; and
therefore, henry, you shall marry the youngest miss bertram, a nice,
handsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very
happy."

henry bowed and thanked her.

"my dear sister," said mary, "if you can persuade him into anything
of the sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself
allied to anybody so clever, and i shall only regret that you have
not half a dozen daughters to dispose of. if you can persuade henry
to marry, you must have the address of a frenchwoman. all that english
abilities can do has been tried already. i have three very particular
friends who have been all dying for him in their turn; and the pains
which they, their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear aunt
and myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick him into marrying, is
inconceivable! he is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined. if
your miss bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke, let them
avoid henry."

"my dear brother, i will not believe this of you."

"no, i am sure you are too good. you will be kinder than mary. you
will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. i am of a cautious
temper, and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry. nobody can
think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself. i consider the
blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of
the poet--'heaven's _last_ best gift.'"

"there, mrs. grant, you see how he dwells on one word, and only look
at his smile. i assure you he is very detestable; the admiral's lessons
have quite spoiled him."

"i pay very little regard," said mrs. grant, "to what any young person
says on the subject of marriage. if they profess a disinclination for
it, i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person."

dr. grant laughingly congratulated miss crawford on feeling no
disinclination to the state herself.

"oh yes! i am not at all ashamed of it. i would have everybody marry if
they can do it properly: i do not like to have people throw themselves
away; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to
advantage."



chapter v

the young people were pleased with each other from the first. on each
side there was much to attract, and their acquaintance soon promised as
early an intimacy as good manners would warrant. miss crawford's beauty
did her no disservice with the miss bertrams. they were too handsome
themselves to dislike any woman for being so too, and were almost as
much charmed as their brothers with her lively dark eye, clear brown
complexion, and general prettiness. had she been tall, full formed, and
fair, it might have been more of a trial: but as it was, there could be
no comparison; and she was most allowably a sweet, pretty girl, while
they were the finest young women in the country.

her brother was not handsome: no, when they first saw him he was
absolutely plain, black and plain; but still he was the gentleman, with
a pleasing address. the second meeting proved him not so very plain:
he was plain, to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and his
teeth were so good, and he was so well made, that one soon forgot he was
plain; and after a third interview, after dining in company with him at
the parsonage, he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody. he
was, in fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known,
and they were equally delighted with him. miss bertram's engagement made
him in equity the property of julia, of which julia was fully aware; and
before he had been at mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallen
in love with.

maria's notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct. she
did not want to see or understand. "there could be no harm in her liking
an agreeable man--everybody knew her situation--mr. crawford must take
care of himself." mr. crawford did not mean to be in any danger! the
miss bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready to be pleased; and he
began with no object but of making them like him. he did not want them
to die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him
judge and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude on such points.

"i like your miss bertrams exceedingly, sister," said he, as he returned
from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit; "they
are very elegant, agreeable girls."

"so they are indeed, and i am delighted to hear you say it. but you like
julia best."

"oh yes! i like julia best."

"but do you really? for miss bertram is in general thought the
handsomest."

"so i should suppose. she has the advantage in every feature, and i
prefer her countenance; but i like julia best; miss bertram is certainly
the handsomest, and i have found her the most agreeable, but i shall
always like julia best, because you order me."

"i shall not talk to you, henry, but i know you _will_ like her best at
last."

"do not i tell you that i like her best _at_ _first_?"

"and besides, miss bertram is engaged. remember that, my dear brother.
her choice is made."

"yes, and i like her the better for it. an engaged woman is always more
agreeable than a disengaged. she is satisfied with herself. her cares
are over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing
without suspicion. all is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be
done."

"why, as to that, mr. rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it
is a great match for her."

"but miss bertram does not care three straws for him; _that_ is your
opinion of your intimate friend. _i_ do not subscribe to it. i am sure
miss bertram is very much attached to mr. rushworth. i could see it in
her eyes, when he was mentioned. i think too well of miss bertram to
suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart."

"mary, how shall we manage him?"

"we must leave him to himself, i believe. talking does no good. he will
be taken in at last."

"but i would not have him _taken_ _in_; i would not have him duped; i
would have it all fair and honourable."

"oh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in. it will do just as
well. everybody is taken in at some period or other."

"not always in marriage, dear mary."

"in marriage especially. with all due respect to such of the present
company as chance to be married, my dear mrs. grant, there is not one in
a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry. look where
i will, i see that it _is_ so; and i feel that it _must_ be so, when i
consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expect
most from others, and are least honest themselves."

"ah! you have been in a bad school for matrimony, in hill street."

"my poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but,
however, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business.
i know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence
of some one particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or
good quality in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived,
and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse. what is this but a
take in?"

"my dear child, there must be a little imagination here. i beg your
pardon, but i cannot quite believe you. depend upon it, you see but
half. you see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. there will
be little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to
expect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human
nature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make
a second better: we find comfort somewhere--and those evil-minded
observers, dearest mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in
and deceived than the parties themselves."

"well done, sister! i honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_. when i am a
wife, i mean to be just as staunch myself; and i wish my friends in
general would be so too. it would save me many a heartache."

"you are as bad as your brother, mary; but we will cure you both.
mansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in. stay with us,
and we will cure you."

the crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay.
mary was satisfied with the parsonage as a present home, and henry
equally ready to lengthen his visit. he had come, intending to spend
only a few days with them; but mansfield promised well, and there was
nothing to call him elsewhere. it delighted mrs. grant to keep them both
with her, and dr. grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: a
talking pretty young woman like miss crawford is always pleasant society
to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and mr. crawford's being his guest was
an excuse for drinking claret every day.

the miss bertrams' admiration of mr. crawford was more rapturous than
anything which miss crawford's habits made her likely to feel. she
acknowledged, however, that the mr. bertrams were very fine young men,
that two such young men were not often seen together even in london, and
that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good.
_he_ had been much in london, and had more liveliness and gallantry than
edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being the
eldest was another strong claim. she had felt an early presentiment that
she _should_ like the eldest best. she knew it was her way.

tom bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he was
the sort of young man to be generally liked, his agreeableness was of
the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher
stamp, for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance,
and a great deal to say; and the reversion of mansfield park, and a
baronetcy, did no harm to all this. miss crawford soon felt that he and
his situation might do. she looked about her with due consideration, and
found almost everything in his favour: a park, a real park, five miles
round, a spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well screened
as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen's
seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be completely new
furnished--pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an agreeable man
himself--with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present
by a promise to his father, and of being sir thomas hereafter. it
might do very well; she believed she should accept him; and she began
accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to
run at the b---- races.

these races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance
began; and as it appeared that the family did not, from his usual goings
on, expect him back again for many weeks, it would bring his passion to
an early proof. much was said on his side to induce her to attend the
races, and schemes were made for a large party to them, with all the
eagerness of inclination, but it would only do to be talked of.

and fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while? and what
was _her_ opinion of the newcomers? few young ladies of eighteen could
be less called on to speak their opinion than fanny. in a quiet way,
very little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to miss
crawford's beauty; but as she still continued to think mr. crawford
very plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the
contrary, she never mentioned _him_. the notice, which she excited
herself, was to this effect. "i begin now to understand you all,
except miss price," said miss crawford, as she was walking with the mr.
bertrams. "pray, is she out, or is she not? i am puzzled. she dined at
the parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_; and
yet she says so little, that i can hardly suppose she _is_."

edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, "i believe i know
what you mean, but i will not undertake to answer the question. my
cousin is grown up. she has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs
and not outs are beyond me."

"and yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. the
distinction is so broad. manners as well as appearance are, generally
speaking, so totally different. till now, i could not have supposed it
possible to be mistaken as to a girl's being out or not. a girl not out
has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks
very demure, and never says a word. you may smile, but it is so, i
assure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,
it is all very proper. girls should be quiet and modest. the most
objectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being
introduced into company is frequently too sudden. they sometimes pass in
such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite--to confidence!
_that_ is the faulty part of the present system. one does not like to
see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing--and
perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before. mr.
bertram, i dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such changes."

"i believe i have, but this is hardly fair; i see what you are at. you
are quizzing me and miss anderson."

"no, indeed. miss anderson! i do not know who or what you mean. i am
quite in the dark. but i _will_ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure,
if you will tell me what about."

"ah! you carry it off very well, but i cannot be quite so far imposed
on. you must have had miss anderson in your eye, in describing an
altered young lady. you paint too accurately for mistake. it was exactly
so. the andersons of baker street. we were speaking of them the other
day, you know. edmund, you have heard me mention charles anderson.
the circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it. when
anderson first introduced me to his family, about two years ago, his
sister was not _out_, and i could not get her to speak to me. i sat
there an hour one morning waiting for anderson, with only her and a
little girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away,
and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and i
could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady--nothing like a
civil answer--she screwed up her mouth, and turned from me with such an
air! i did not see her again for a twelvemonth. she was then _out_. i
met her at mrs. holford's, and did not recollect her. she came up to me,
claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and talked
and laughed till i did not know which way to look. i felt that i must
be the jest of the room at the time, and miss crawford, it is plain, has
heard the story."

"and a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, i dare say,
than does credit to miss anderson. it is too common a fault. mothers
certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their
daughters. i do not know where the error lies. i do not pretend to set
people right, but i do see that they are often wrong."

"those who are showing the world what female manners _should_ be," said
mr. bertram gallantly, "are doing a great deal to set them right."

"the error is plain enough," said the less courteous edmund; "such girls
are ill brought up. they are given wrong notions from the beginning.
they are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more
real modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public than
afterwards."

"i do not know," replied miss crawford hesitatingly. "yes, i cannot
agree with you there. it is certainly the modestest part of the
business. it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the
same airs and take the same liberties as if they were, which i have seen
done. that is worse than anything--quite disgusting!"

"yes, _that_ is very inconvenient indeed," said mr. bertram. "it leads
one astray; one does not know what to do. the close bonnet and demure
air you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one what
is expected; but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of
them. i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september,
just after my return from the west indies. my friend sneyd--you have
heard me speak of sneyd, edmund--his father, and mother, and sisters,
were there, all new to me. when we reached albion place they were out;
we went after them, and found them on the pier: mrs. and the two miss
sneyds, with others of their acquaintance. i made my bow in form; and
as mrs. sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to one of her
daughters, walked by her side all the way home, and made myself as
agreeable as i could; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners, and
as ready to talk as to listen. i had not a suspicion that i could be
doing anything wrong. they looked just the same: both well-dressed, with
veils and parasols like other girls; but i afterwards found that i had
been giving all my attention to the youngest, who was not _out_, and
had most excessively offended the eldest. miss augusta ought not to have
been noticed for the next six months; and miss sneyd, i believe, has
never forgiven me."

"that was bad indeed. poor miss sneyd. though i have no younger
sister, i feel for her. to be neglected before one's time must be very
vexatious; but it was entirely the mother's fault. miss augusta should
have been with her governess. such half-and-half doings never prosper.
but now i must be satisfied about miss price. does she go to balls? does
she dine out every where, as well as at my sister's?"

"no," replied edmund; "i do not think she has ever been to a ball. my
mother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with mrs.
grant, and fanny stays at home with _her_."

"oh! then the point is clear. miss price is not out."



chapter vi

mr. bertram set off for--------, and miss crawford was prepared to
find a great chasm in their society, and to miss him decidedly in the
meetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families;
and on their all dining together at the park soon after his going, she
retook her chosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting to
feel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters. it would
be a very flat business, she was sure. in comparison with his brother,
edmund would have nothing to say. the soup would be sent round in a most
spiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,
and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any
former haunch, or a single entertaining story, about "my friend such a
one." she must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper
end of the table, and in observing mr. rushworth, who was now making his
appearance at mansfield for the first time since the crawfords' arrival.
he had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and that
friend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver, mr.
rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject, and very eager
to be improving his own place in the same way; and though not saying
much to the purpose, could talk of nothing else. the subject had
been already handled in the drawing-room; it was revived in the
dining-parlour. miss bertram's attention and opinion was evidently his
chief aim; and though her deportment showed rather conscious superiority
than any solicitude to oblige him, the mention of sotherton court,
and the ideas attached to it, gave her a feeling of complacency, which
prevented her from being very ungracious.

"i wish you could see compton," said he; "it is the most complete thing!
i never saw a place so altered in my life. i told smith i did not know
where i was. the approach _now_, is one of the finest things in the
country: you see the house in the most surprising manner. i declare,
when i got back to sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison--quite a
dismal old prison."

"oh, for shame!" cried mrs. norris. "a prison indeed? sotherton court is
the noblest old place in the world."

"it wants improvement, ma'am, beyond anything. i never saw a place that
wanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that i do
not know what can be done with it."

"no wonder that mr. rushworth should think so at present," said mrs.
grant to mrs. norris, with a smile; "but depend upon it, sotherton will
have _every_ improvement in time which his heart can desire."

"i must try to do something with it," said mr. rushworth, "but i do not
know what. i hope i shall have some good friend to help me."

"your best friend upon such an occasion," said miss bertram calmly,
"would be mr. repton, i imagine."

"that is what i was thinking of. as he has done so well by smith, i
think i had better have him at once. his terms are five guineas a day."

"well, and if they were _ten_," cried mrs. norris, "i am sure _you_ need
not regard it. the expense need not be any impediment. if i were you,
i should not think of the expense. i would have everything done in the
best style, and made as nice as possible. such a place as sotherton
court deserves everything that taste and money can do. you have space to
work upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. for my own part,
if i had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of sotherton, i
should be always planting and improving, for naturally i am excessively
fond of it. it would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where
i am now, with my little half acre. it would be quite a burlesque. but
if i had more room, i should take a prodigious delight in improving and
planting. we did a vast deal in that way at the parsonage: we made it
quite a different place from what it was when we first had it. you young
ones do not remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear sir thomas were
here, he could tell you what improvements we made: and a great deal more
would have been done, but for poor mr. norris's sad state of health.
he could hardly ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and _that_
disheartened me from doing several things that sir thomas and i used to
talk of. if it had not been for _that_, we should have carried on the
garden wall, and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard, just
as dr. grant has done. we were always doing something as it was. it was
only the spring twelvemonth before mr. norris's death that we put in the
apricot against the stable wall, which is now grown such a noble tree,
and getting to such perfection, sir," addressing herself then to dr.
grant.

"the tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam," replied dr. grant. "the
soil is good; and i never pass it without regretting that the fruit
should be so little worth the trouble of gathering."

"sir, it is a moor park, we bought it as a moor park, and it cost
us--that is, it was a present from sir thomas, but i saw the bill--and i
know it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a moor park."

"you were imposed on, ma'am," replied dr. grant: "these potatoes have as
much the flavour of a moor park apricot as the fruit from that tree. it
is an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable, which
none from my garden are."

"the truth is, ma'am," said mrs. grant, pretending to whisper across
the table to mrs. norris, "that dr. grant hardly knows what the natural
taste of our apricot is: he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it
is so valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such a
remarkably large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves,
my cook contrives to get them all."

mrs. norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased; and, for a little
while, other subjects took place of the improvements of sotherton. dr.
grant and mrs. norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had
begun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.

after a short interruption mr. rushworth began again. "smith's place
is the admiration of all the country; and it was a mere nothing before
repton took it in hand. i think i shall have repton."

"mr. rushworth," said lady bertram, "if i were you, i would have a
very pretty shrubbery. one likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine
weather."

mr. rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence, and
tried to make out something complimentary; but, between his submission
to _her_ taste, and his having always intended the same himself, with
the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies
in general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was
anxious to please, he grew puzzled, and edmund was glad to put an end
to his speech by a proposal of wine. mr. rushworth, however, though not
usually a great talker, had still more to say on the subject next his
heart. "smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his
grounds, which is little enough, and makes it more surprising that the
place can have been so improved. now, at sotherton we have a good seven
hundred, without reckoning the water meadows; so that i think, if so
much could be done at compton, we need not despair. there have been two
or three fine old trees cut down, that grew too near the house, and
it opens the prospect amazingly, which makes me think that repton, or
anybody of that sort, would certainly have the avenue at sotherton down:
the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill,
you know," turning to miss bertram particularly as he spoke. but miss
bertram thought it most becoming to reply--

"the avenue! oh! i do not recollect it. i really know very little of
sotherton."

fanny, who was sitting on the other side of edmund, exactly opposite
miss crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked at
him, and said in a low voice--

"cut down an avenue! what a pity! does it not make you think of cowper?
'ye fallen avenues, once more i mourn your fate unmerited.'"

he smiled as he answered, "i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance,
fanny."

"i should like to see sotherton before it is cut down, to see the place
as it is now, in its old state; but i do not suppose i shall."

"have you never been there? no, you never can; and, unluckily, it is out
of distance for a ride. i wish we could contrive it."

"oh! it does not signify. whenever i do see it, you will tell me how it
has been altered."

"i collect," said miss crawford, "that sotherton is an old place, and a
place of some grandeur. in any particular style of building?"

"the house was built in elizabeth's time, and is a large, regular, brick
building; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. it
is ill placed. it stands in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that
respect, unfavourable for improvement. but the woods are fine, and
there is a stream, which, i dare say, might be made a good deal of. mr.
rushworth is quite right, i think, in meaning to give it a modern dress,
and i have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well."

miss crawford listened with submission, and said to herself, "he is a
well-bred man; he makes the best of it."

"i do not wish to influence mr. rushworth," he continued; "but, had i
a place to new fashion, i should not put myself into the hands of an
improver. i would rather have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own
choice, and acquired progressively. i would rather abide by my own
blunders than by his."

"_you_ would know what you were about, of course; but that would not
suit _me_. i have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they are
before me; and had i a place of my own in the country, i should be most
thankful to any mr. repton who would undertake it, and give me as much
beauty as he could for my money; and i should never look at it till it
was complete."

"it would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress of it all," said
fanny.

"ay, you have been brought up to it. it was no part of my education; and
the only dose i ever had, being administered by not the first favourite
in the world, has made me consider improvements _in_ _hand_ as the
greatest of nuisances. three years ago the admiral, my honoured uncle,
bought a cottage at twickenham for us all to spend our summers in;
and my aunt and i went down to it quite in raptures; but it being
excessively pretty, it was soon found necessary to be improved, and for
three months we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to
step on, or a bench fit for use. i would have everything as complete
as possible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rustic
seats innumerable: but it must all be done without my care. henry is
different; he loves to be doing."

edmund was sorry to hear miss crawford, whom he was much disposed to
admire, speak so freely of her uncle. it did not suit his sense of
propriety, and he was silenced, till induced by further smiles and
liveliness to put the matter by for the present.

"mr. bertram," said she, "i have tidings of my harp at last. i am
assured that it is safe at northampton; and there it has probably been
these ten days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often
received to the contrary." edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise.
"the truth is, that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant,
we went ourselves: this will not do seventy miles from london; but this
morning we heard of it in the right way. it was seen by some farmer, and
he told the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher's
son-in-law left word at the shop."

"i am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hope
there will be no further delay."

"i am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it is to be conveyed?
not by a wagon or cart: oh no! nothing of that kind could be hired in
the village. i might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow."

"you would find it difficult, i dare say, just now, in the middle of a
very late hay harvest, to hire a horse and cart?"

"i was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it! to want
a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible, so i told my maid to
speak for one directly; and as i cannot look out of my dressing-closet
without seeing one farmyard, nor walk in the shrubbery without passing
another, i thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather grieved
that i could not give the advantage to all. guess my surprise, when
i found that i had been asking the most unreasonable, most impossible
thing in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the labourers,
all the hay in the parish! as for dr. grant's bailiff, i believe i had
better keep out of _his_ way; and my brother-in-law himself, who is all
kindness in general, looked rather black upon me when he found what i
had been at."

"you could not be expected to have thought on the subject before; but
when you _do_ think of it, you must see the importance of getting in
the grass. the hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you
suppose: our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, in
harvest, it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse."

"i shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down with the
true london maxim, that everything is to be got with money, i was a
little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country
customs. however, i am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. henry, who is
good-nature itself, has offered to fetch it in his barouche. will it not
be honourably conveyed?"

edmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument, and hoped to be
soon allowed to hear her. fanny had never heard the harp at all, and
wished for it very much.

"i shall be most happy to play to you both," said miss crawford; "at
least as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for
i dearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the
player must always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than
one. now, mr. bertram, if you write to your brother, i entreat you to
tell him that my harp is come: he heard so much of my misery about it.
and you may say, if you please, that i shall prepare my most plaintive
airs against his return, in compassion to his feelings, as i know his
horse will lose."

"if i write, i will say whatever you wish me; but i do not, at present,
foresee any occasion for writing."

"no, i dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you ever
write to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped. the occasion would
never be foreseen. what strange creatures brothers are! you would not
write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; and
when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or such
a relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. you have but
one style among you. i know it perfectly. henry, who is in every other
respect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me,
confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never
yet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more
than--'dear mary, i am just arrived. bath seems full, and everything
as usual. yours sincerely.' that is the true manly style; that is a
complete brother's letter."

"when they are at a distance from all their family," said fanny,
colouring for william's sake, "they can write long letters."

"miss price has a brother at sea," said edmund, "whose excellence as a
correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us."

"at sea, has she? in the king's service, of course?"

fanny would rather have had edmund tell the story, but his determined
silence obliged her to relate her brother's situation: her voice was
animated in speaking of his profession, and the foreign stations he had
been on; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been
absent without tears in her eyes. miss crawford civilly wished him an
early promotion.

"do you know anything of my cousin's captain?" said edmund; "captain
marshall? you have a large acquaintance in the navy, i conclude?"

"among admirals, large enough; but," with an air of grandeur, "we know
very little of the inferior ranks. post-captains may be very good sort
of men, but they do not belong to _us_. of various admirals i could tell
you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of their
pay, and their bickerings and jealousies. but, in general, i can assure
you that they are all passed over, and all very ill used. certainly, my
home at my uncle's brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. of
_rears_ and _vices_ i saw enough. now do not be suspecting me of a pun,
i entreat."

edmund again felt grave, and only replied, "it is a noble profession."

"yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it make
the fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, it
is not a favourite profession of mine. it has never worn an amiable form
to _me_."

edmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy in the prospect of
hearing her play.

the subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still under
consideration among the others; and mrs. grant could not help addressing
her brother, though it was calling his attention from miss julia
bertram.

"my dear henry, have _you_ nothing to say? you have been an improver
yourself, and from what i hear of everingham, it may vie with any place
in england. its natural beauties, i am sure, are great. everingham,
as it _used_ to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of
ground, and such timber! what would i not give to see it again?"

"nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,"
was his answer; "but i fear there would be some disappointment: you
would not find it equal to your present ideas. in extent, it is a mere
nothing; you would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for
improvement, there was very little for me to do--too little: i should
like to have been busy much longer."

"you are fond of the sort of thing?" said julia.

"excessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, which
pointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done,
and my own consequent resolutions, i had not been of age three
months before everingham was all that it is now. my plan was laid
at westminster, a little altered, perhaps, at cambridge, and at
one-and-twenty executed. i am inclined to envy mr. rushworth for having
so much happiness yet before him. i have been a devourer of my own."

"those who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,"
said julia. "_you_ can never want employment. instead of envying mr.
rushworth, you should assist him with your opinion."

mrs. grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,
persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother's; and as
miss bertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,
declaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consult
with friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the
business into the hands of a professional man, mr. rushworth was very
ready to request the favour of mr. crawford's assistance; and mr.
crawford, after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at
his service in any way that could be useful. mr. rushworth then began to
propose mr. crawford's doing him the honour of coming over to sotherton,
and taking a bed there; when mrs. norris, as if reading in her two
nieces' minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take mr.
crawford away, interposed with an amendment.

"there can be no doubt of mr. crawford's willingness; but why should not
more of us go? why should not we make a little party? here are many that
would be interested in your improvements, my dear mr. rushworth, and
that would like to hear mr. crawford's opinion on the spot, and that
might be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions; and, for my
own part, i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again;
nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss; but
now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs. rushworth, while the rest
of you walked about and settled things, and then we could all return
to a late dinner here, or dine at sotherton, just as might be most
agreeable to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight.
i dare say mr. crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche,
and edmund can go on horseback, you know, sister, and fanny will stay at
home with you."

lady bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the going
was forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting edmund, who
heard it all and said nothing.



chapter vii

"well, fanny, and how do you like miss crawford _now_?" said edmund the
next day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. "how did you
like her yesterday?"

"very well--very much. i like to hear her talk. she entertains me; and
she is so extremely pretty, that i have great pleasure in looking at
her."

"it is her countenance that is so attractive. she has a wonderful play
of feature! but was there nothing in her conversation that struck you,
fanny, as not quite right?"

"oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. i was
quite astonished. an uncle with whom she has been living so many years,
and who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother,
treating him, they say, quite like a son. i could not have believed it!"

"i thought you would be struck. it was very wrong; very indecorous."

"and very ungrateful, i think."

"ungrateful is a strong word. i do not know that her uncle has any claim
to her _gratitude_; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth of her
respect for her aunt's memory which misleads her here. she is awkwardly
circumstanced. with such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be
difficult to do justice to her affection for mrs. crawford, without
throwing a shade on the admiral. i do not pretend to know which was most
to blame in their disagreements, though the admiral's present conduct
might incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural and amiable
that miss crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. i do not censure her
_opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in making them public."

"do not you think," said fanny, after a little consideration, "that this
impropriety is a reflection itself upon mrs. crawford, as her niece has
been entirely brought up by her? she cannot have given her right notions
of what was due to the admiral."

"that is a fair remark. yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece
to have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of the
disadvantages she has been under. but i think her present home must
do her good. mrs. grant's manners are just what they ought to be. she
speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection."

"yes, except as to his writing her such short letters. she made me
almost laugh; but i cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature
of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything
worth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. i am sure william
would never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances. and what right
had she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters when you were
absent?"

"the right of a lively mind, fanny, seizing whatever may contribute
to its own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when
untinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of
either in the countenance or manner of miss crawford: nothing sharp, or
loud, or coarse. she is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we
have been speaking of. there she cannot be justified. i am glad you saw
it all as i did."

having formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance
of her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject,
there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a line
of admiration of miss crawford, which might lead him where fanny
could not follow. miss crawford's attractions did not lessen. the harp
arrived, and rather added to her beauty, wit, and good-humour; for she
played with the greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste
which were peculiarly becoming, and there was something clever to be
said at the close of every air. edmund was at the parsonage every day,
to be indulged with his favourite instrument: one morning secured an
invitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a
listener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.

a young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and
both placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a
little lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was
enough to catch any man's heart. the season, the scene, the air, were
all favourable to tenderness and sentiment. mrs. grant and her tambour
frame were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as
everything will turn to account when love is once set going, even the
sandwich tray, and dr. grant doing the honours of it, were worth looking
at. without studying the business, however, or knowing what he was
about, edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such intercourse,
to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady it may be added
that, without his being a man of the world or an elder brother, without
any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk, he began to
be agreeable to her. she felt it to be so, though she had not foreseen,
and could hardly understand it; for he was not pleasant by any common
rule: he talked no nonsense; he paid no compliments; his opinions
were unbending, his attentions tranquil and simple. there was a charm,
perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness, his integrity, which miss
crawford might be equal to feel, though not equal to discuss with
herself. she did not think very much about it, however: he pleased her
for the present; she liked to have him near her; it was enough.

fanny could not wonder that edmund was at the parsonage every morning;
she would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited
and unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when the
evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he should
think it right to attend mrs. grant and her sister to their home, while
mr. crawford was devoted to the ladies of the park; but she thought it
a very bad exchange; and if edmund were not there to mix the wine and
water for her, would rather go without it than not. she was a little
surprised that he could spend so many hours with miss crawford, and
not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed, and of
which _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature
whenever she was in her company; but so it was. edmund was fond of
speaking to her of miss crawford, but he seemed to think it enough that
the admiral had since been spared; and she scrupled to point out her own
remarks to him, lest it should appear like ill-nature. the first actual
pain which miss crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an
inclination to learn to ride, which the former caught, soon after her
being settled at mansfield, from the example of the young ladies at the
park, and which, when edmund's acquaintance with her increased, led to
his encouraging the wish, and the offer of his own quiet mare for the
purpose of her first attempts, as the best fitted for a beginner that
either stable could furnish. no pain, no injury, however, was designed
by him to his cousin in this offer: _she_ was not to lose a day's
exercise by it. the mare was only to be taken down to the parsonage half
an hour before her ride were to begin; and fanny, on its being first
proposed, so far from feeling slighted, was almost over-powered with
gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it.

miss crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and no
inconvenience to fanny. edmund, who had taken down the mare and presided
at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before either fanny or
the steady old coachman, who always attended her when she rode without
her cousins, were ready to set forward. the second day's trial was not
so guiltless. miss crawford's enjoyment of riding was such that she did
not know how to leave off. active and fearless, and though rather small,
strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to the pure
genuine pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added in
edmund's attendance and instructions, and something more in the
conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early
progress, to make her unwilling to dismount. fanny was ready and
waiting, and mrs. norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone,
and still no horse was announced, no edmund appeared. to avoid her aunt,
and look for him, she went out.

the houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of
each other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could
look down the park, and command a view of the parsonage and all its
demesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in dr. grant's
meadow she immediately saw the group--edmund and miss crawford both on
horse-back, riding side by side, dr. and mrs. grant, and mr. crawford,
with two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. a happy party
it appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a
doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. it was a sound
which did not make _her_ cheerful; she wondered that edmund should
forget her, and felt a pang. she could not turn her eyes from the
meadow; she could not help watching all that passed. at first miss
crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not
small, at a foot's pace; then, at _her_ apparent suggestion, they rose
into a canter; and to fanny's timid nature it was most astonishing to
see how well she sat. after a few minutes they stopped entirely. edmund
was close to her; he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing her
management of the bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or the
imagination supplied what the eye could not reach. she must not wonder
at all this; what could be more natural than that edmund should be
making himself useful, and proving his good-nature by any one? she could
not but think, indeed, that mr. crawford might as well have saved him
the trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming
in a brother to have done it himself; but mr. crawford, with all his
boasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew nothing
of the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of edmund. she
began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty; if
she were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered.

her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised
by seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and miss crawford still on
horseback, but attended by edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the
lane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.
she began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked
to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.

"my dear miss price," said miss crawford, as soon as she was at all
within hearing, "i am come to make my own apologies for keeping you
waiting; but i have nothing in the world to say for myself--i knew it
was very late, and that i was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if
you please, you must forgive me. selfishness must always be forgiven,
you know, because there is no hope of a cure."

fanny's answer was extremely civil, and edmund added his conviction that
she could be in no hurry. "for there is more than time enough for my
cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes," said he, "and you have
been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an
hour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from the
heat as she would have done then. i wish _you_ may not be fatigued by so
much exercise. i wish you had saved yourself this walk home."

"no part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, i assure you,"
said she, as she sprang down with his help; "i am very strong. nothing
ever fatigues me but doing what i do not like. miss price, i give way to
you with a very bad grace; but i sincerely hope you will have a pleasant
ride, and that i may have nothing but good to hear of this dear,
delightful, beautiful animal."

the old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now
joining them, fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another
part of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing, as
she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together to
the village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on
miss crawford's great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been
watching with an interest almost equal to her own.

"it is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!"
said he. "i never see one sit a horse better. she did not seem to have
a thought of fear. very different from you, miss, when you first began,
six years ago come next easter. lord bless you! how you did tremble when
sir thomas first had you put on!"

in the drawing-room miss crawford was also celebrated. her merit in
being gifted by nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated
by the miss bertrams; her delight in riding was like their own; her
early excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure
in praising it.

"i was sure she would ride well," said julia; "she has the make for it.
her figure is as neat as her brother's."

"yes," added maria, "and her spirits are as good, and she has the same
energy of character. i cannot but think that good horsemanship has a
great deal to do with the mind."

when they parted at night edmund asked fanny whether she meant to ride
the next day.

"no, i do not know--not if you want the mare," was her answer.

"i do not want her at all for myself," said he; "but whenever you are
next inclined to stay at home, i think miss crawford would be glad to
have her a longer time--for a whole morning, in short. she has a great
desire to get as far as mansfield common: mrs. grant has been telling
her of its fine views, and i have no doubt of her being perfectly equal
to it. but any morning will do for this. she would be extremely sorry to
interfere with you. it would be very wrong if she did. _she_ rides only
for pleasure; _you_ for health."

"i shall not ride to-morrow, certainly," said fanny; "i have been out
very often lately, and would rather stay at home. you know i am strong
enough now to walk very well."

edmund looked pleased, which must be fanny's comfort, and the ride to
mansfield common took place the next morning: the party included all the
young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly
enjoyed again in the evening discussion. a successful scheme of this
sort generally brings on another; and the having been to mansfield
common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. there
were many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot, there
were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. a young party is always
provided with a shady lane. four fine mornings successively were spent
in this manner, in shewing the crawfords the country, and doing the
honours of its finest spots. everything answered; it was all gaiety and
good-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked
of with pleasure--till the fourth day, when the happiness of one of
the party was exceedingly clouded. miss bertram was the one. edmund and
julia were invited to dine at the parsonage, and _she_ was excluded.
it was meant and done by mrs. grant, with perfect good-humour, on mr.
rushworth's account, who was partly expected at the park that day;
but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good manners were
severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home.
as mr. rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was increased, and she had
not even the relief of shewing her power over him; she could only be
sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and throw as great a gloom as
possible over their dinner and dessert.

between ten and eleven edmund and julia walked into the drawing-room,
fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse
of what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for maria would
scarcely raise her eyes from her book, and lady bertram was half-asleep;
and even mrs. norris, discomposed by her niece's ill-humour, and having
asked one or two questions about the dinner, which were not immediately
attended to, seemed almost determined to say no more. for a few minutes
the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and
their remarks on the stars, to think beyond themselves; but when the
first pause came, edmund, looking around, said, "but where is fanny? is
she gone to bed?"

"no, not that i know of," replied mrs. norris; "she was here a moment
ago."

her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was
a very long one, told them that she was on the sofa. mrs. norris began
scolding.

"that is a very foolish trick, fanny, to be idling away all the evening
upon a sofa. why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as
_we_ do? if you have no work of your own, i can supply you from the
poor basket. there is all the new calico, that was bought last week,
not touched yet. i am sure i almost broke my back by cutting it out. you
should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it is a
shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa."

before half this was said, fanny was returned to her seat at the table,
and had taken up her work again; and julia, who was in high good-humour,
from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming, "i
must say, ma'am, that fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the
house."

"fanny," said edmund, after looking at her attentively, "i am sure you
have the headache."

she could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.

"i can hardly believe you," he replied; "i know your looks too well. how
long have you had it?"

"since a little before dinner. it is nothing but the heat."

"did you go out in the heat?"

"go out! to be sure she did," said mrs. norris: "would you have her stay
within such a fine day as this? were not we _all_ out? even your mother
was out to-day for above an hour."

"yes, indeed, edmund," added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly
awakened by mrs. norris's sharp reprimand to fanny; "i was out above an
hour. i sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while fanny
cut the roses; and very pleasant it was, i assure you, but very hot. it
was shady enough in the alcove, but i declare i quite dreaded the coming
home again."

"fanny has been cutting roses, has she?"

"yes, and i am afraid they will be the last this year. poor thing! _she_
found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could not
wait."

"there was no help for it, certainly," rejoined mrs. norris, in a rather
softened voice; "but i question whether her headache might not be caught
_then_, sister. there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and
stooping in a hot sun; but i dare say it will be well to-morrow. suppose
you let her have your aromatic vinegar; i always forget to have mine
filled."

"she has got it," said lady bertram; "she has had it ever since she came
back from your house the second time."

"what!" cried edmund; "has she been walking as well as cutting roses;
walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma'am? no
wonder her head aches."

mrs. norris was talking to julia, and did not hear.

"i was afraid it would be too much for her," said lady bertram; "but
when the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then
you know they must be taken home."

"but were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?"

"no; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and, unluckily,
fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so she
was obliged to go again."

edmund got up and walked about the room, saying, "and could nobody be
employed on such an errand but fanny? upon my word, ma'am, it has been a
very ill-managed business."

"i am sure i do not know how it was to have been done better," cried
mrs. norris, unable to be longer deaf; "unless i had gone myself,
indeed; but i cannot be in two places at once; and i was talking to mr.
green at that very time about your mother's dairymaid, by _her_ desire,
and had promised john groom to write to mrs. jefferies about his son,
and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour. i think nobody
can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really i
cannot do everything at once. and as for fanny's just stepping down
to my house for me--it is not much above a quarter of a mile--i cannot
think i was unreasonable to ask it. how often do i pace it three times a
day, early and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about
it?"

"i wish fanny had half your strength, ma'am."

"if fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would not be
knocked up so soon. she has not been out on horseback now this long
while, and i am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought to
walk. if she had been riding before, i should not have asked it of her.
but i thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the
roses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue
of that kind; and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.
between ourselves, edmund," nodding significantly at his mother, "it was
cutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that did the
mischief."

"i am afraid it was, indeed," said the more candid lady bertram, who had
overheard her; "i am very much afraid she caught the headache there,
for the heat was enough to kill anybody. it was as much as i could bear
myself. sitting and calling to pug, and trying to keep him from the
flower-beds, was almost too much for me."

edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table,
on which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of madeira to
fanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part. she wished to be able
to decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made
it easier to swallow than to speak.

vexed as edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still more angry
with himself. his own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which
they had done. nothing of this would have happened had she been properly
considered; but she had been left four days together without any choice
of companions or exercise, and without any excuse for avoiding whatever
her unreasonable aunts might require. he was ashamed to think that
for four days together she had not had the power of riding, and very
seriously resolved, however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of
miss crawford's, that it should never happen again.

fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her
arrival at the park. the state of her spirits had probably had its
share in her indisposition; for she had been feeling neglected, and been
struggling against discontent and envy for some days past. as she leant
on the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, the
pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden
change which edmund's kindness had then occasioned, made her hardly know
how to support herself.



chapter viii

fanny's rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasant
fresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been, edmund
trusted that her losses, both of health and pleasure, would be soon made
good. while she was gone mr. rushworth arrived, escorting his mother,
who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in urging the
execution of the plan for visiting sotherton, which had been started a
fortnight before, and which, in consequence of her subsequent absence
from home, had since lain dormant. mrs. norris and her nieces were all
well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and agreed
to, provided mr. crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies did
not forget that stipulation, and though mrs. norris would willingly have
answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the liberty nor
run the risk; and at last, on a hint from miss bertram, mr. rushworth
discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down
to the parsonage directly, and call on mr. crawford, and inquire whether
wednesday would suit him or not.

before his return mrs. grant and miss crawford came in. having been out
some time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not met
him. comfortable hopes, however, were given that he would find mr.
crawford at home. the sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. it was
hardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of,
for mrs. norris was in high spirits about it; and mrs. rushworth, a
well-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of
consequence, but as it related to her own and her son's concerns,
had not yet given over pressing lady bertram to be of the party. lady
bertram constantly declined it; but her placid manner of refusal made
mrs. rushworth still think she wished to come, till mrs. norris's more
numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth.

"the fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, i
assure you, my dear mrs. rushworth. ten miles there, and ten back, you
know. you must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our
two dear girls and myself without her. sotherton is the only place that
could give her a _wish_ to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. she will
have a companion in fanny price, you know, so it will all do very well;
and as for edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, i will answer
for his being most happy to join the party. he can go on horseback, you
know."

mrs. rushworth being obliged to yield to lady bertram's staying at home,
could only be sorry. "the loss of her ladyship's company would be a
great drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seen
the young lady too, miss price, who had never been at sotherton yet, and
it was a pity she should not see the place."

"you are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam," cried mrs.
norris; "but as to fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty of
seeing sotherton. she has time enough before her; and her going now is
quite out of the question. lady bertram could not possibly spare her."

"oh no! i cannot do without fanny."

mrs. rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must
be wanting to see sotherton, to include miss crawford in the invitation;
and though mrs. grant, who had not been at the trouble of visiting mrs.
rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly declined it on
her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister;
and mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in accepting
her share of the civility. mr. rushworth came back from the parsonage
successful; and edmund made his appearance just in time to learn
what had been settled for wednesday, to attend mrs. rushworth to her
carriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two other ladies.

on his return to the breakfast-room, he found mrs. norris trying to
make up her mind as to whether miss crawford's being of the party were
desirable or not, or whether her brother's barouche would not be full
without her. the miss bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her that
the barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on
which _one_ might go with him.

"but why is it necessary," said edmund, "that crawford's carriage, or
his _only_, should be employed? why is no use to be made of my mother's
chaise? i could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other
day, understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the
carriage of the family."

"what!" cried julia: "go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather,
when we may have seats in a barouche! no, my dear edmund, that will not
quite do."

"besides," said maria, "i know that mr. crawford depends upon taking us.
after what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise."

"and, my dear edmund," added mrs. norris, "taking out _two_ carriages
when _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between
ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and
sotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching
his carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas,
when he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off."

"that would not be a very handsome reason for using mr. crawford's,"
said maria; "but the truth is, that wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and
does not know how to drive. i will answer for it that we shall find no
inconvenience from narrow roads on wednesday."

"there is no hardship, i suppose, nothing unpleasant," said edmund, "in
going on the barouche box."

"unpleasant!" cried maria: "oh dear! i believe it would be generally
thought the favourite seat. there can be no comparison as to one's view
of the country. probably miss crawford will choose the barouche-box
herself."

"there can be no objection, then, to fanny's going with you; there can
be no doubt of your having room for her."

"fanny!" repeated mrs. norris; "my dear edmund, there is no idea of her
going with us. she stays with her aunt. i told mrs. rushworth so. she is
not expected."

"you can have no reason, i imagine, madam," said he, addressing his
mother, "for wishing fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates
to yourself, to your own comfort. if you could do without her, you would
not wish to keep her at home?"

"to be sure not, but i _cannot_ do without her."

"you can, if i stay at home with you, as i mean to do."

there was a general cry out at this. "yes," he continued, "there is no
necessity for my going, and i mean to stay at home. fanny has a great
desire to see sotherton. i know she wishes it very much. she has not
often a gratification of the kind, and i am sure, ma'am, you would be
glad to give her the pleasure now?"

"oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection."

mrs. norris was very ready with the only objection which could
remain--their having positively assured mrs. rushworth that fanny could
not go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in
taking her, which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got
over. it must have the strangest appearance! it would be something so
very unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect for mrs. rushworth, whose
own manners were such a pattern of good-breeding and attention, that she
really did not feel equal to it. mrs. norris had no affection for fanny,
and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her opposition to
edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own scheme, because it
_was_ her own, than from anything else. she felt that she had arranged
everything extremely well, and that any alteration must be for the
worse. when edmund, therefore, told her in reply, as he did when she
would give him the hearing, that she need not distress herself on mrs.
rushworth's account, because he had taken the opportunity, as he walked
with her through the hall, of mentioning miss price as one who would
probably be of the party, and had directly received a very sufficient
invitation for his cousin, mrs. norris was too much vexed to submit with
a very good grace, and would only say, "very well, very well, just as
you chuse, settle it your own way, i am sure i do not care about it."

"it seems very odd," said maria, "that you should be staying at home
instead of fanny."

"i am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you," added julia,
hastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she
ought to offer to stay at home herself.

"fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires," was
edmund's only reply, and the subject dropt.

fanny's gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact, much greater
than her pleasure. she felt edmund's kindness with all, and more than
all, the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment,
could be aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her
account gave her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing sotherton
would be nothing without him.

the next meeting of the two mansfield families produced another
alteration in the plan, and one that was admitted with general
approbation. mrs. grant offered herself as companion for the day to lady
bertram in lieu of her son, and dr. grant was to join them at dinner.
lady bertram was very well pleased to have it so, and the young ladies
were in spirits again. even edmund was very thankful for an arrangement
which restored him to his share of the party; and mrs. norris thought it
an excellent plan, and had it at her tongue's end, and was on the point
of proposing it, when mrs. grant spoke.

wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, mr.
crawford driving his sisters; and as everybody was ready, there was
nothing to be done but for mrs. grant to alight and the others to take
their places. the place of all places, the envied seat, the post of
honour, was unappropriated. to whose happy lot was it to fall? while
each of the miss bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most
appearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled
by mrs. grant's saying, as she stepped from the carriage, "as there are
five of you, it will be better that one should sit with henry; and as
you were saying lately that you wished you could drive, julia, i think
this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson."

happy julia! unhappy maria! the former was on the barouche-box in a
moment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification; and
the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies,
and the barking of pug in his mistress's arms.

their road was through a pleasant country; and fanny, whose rides had
never been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy
in observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. she was
not often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor did
she desire it. her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her
best companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the
bearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the harvest,
the cottages, the cattle, the children, she found entertainment that
could only have been heightened by having edmund to speak to of what she
felt. that was the only point of resemblance between her and the lady
who sat by her: in everything but a value for edmund, miss crawford was
very unlike her. she had none of fanny's delicacy of taste, of mind, of
feeling; she saw nature, inanimate nature, with little observation;
her attention was all for men and women, her talents for the light
and lively. in looking back after edmund, however, when there was any
stretch of road behind them, or when he gained on them in ascending a
considerable hill, they were united, and a "there he is" broke at the
same moment from them both, more than once.

for the first seven miles miss bertram had very little real comfort:
her prospect always ended in mr. crawford and her sister sitting side by
side, full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his expressive
profile as he turned with a smile to julia, or to catch the laugh of
the other, was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own sense
of propriety could but just smooth over. when julia looked back, it was
with a countenance of delight, and whenever she spoke to them, it was in
the highest spirits: "her view of the country was charming, she wished
they could all see it," etc.; but her only offer of exchange was
addressed to miss crawford, as they gained the summit of a long hill,
and was not more inviting than this: "here is a fine burst of country. i
wish you had my seat, but i dare say you will not take it, let me press
you ever so much;" and miss crawford could hardly answer before they
were moving again at a good pace.

when they came within the influence of sotherton associations, it was
better for miss bertram, who might be said to have two strings to her
bow. she had rushworth feelings, and crawford feelings, and in
the vicinity of sotherton the former had considerable effect. mr.
rushworth's consequence was hers. she could not tell miss crawford that
"those woods belonged to sotherton," she could not carelessly observe
that "she believed that it was now all mr. rushworth's property on each
side of the road," without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure
to increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion,
and ancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of
court-leet and court-baron.

"now we shall have no more rough road, miss crawford; our difficulties
are over. the rest of the way is such as it ought to be. mr. rushworth
has made it since he succeeded to the estate. here begins the village.
those cottages are really a disgrace. the church spire is reckoned
remarkably handsome. i am glad the church is not so close to the great
house as often happens in old places. the annoyance of the bells must be
terrible. there is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and i understand
the clergyman and his wife are very decent people. those are almshouses,
built by some of the family. to the right is the steward's house; he
is a very respectable man. now we are coming to the lodge-gates; but we
have nearly a mile through the park still. it is not ugly, you see, at
this end; there is some fine timber, but the situation of the house is
dreadful. we go down hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity, for
it would not be an ill-looking place if it had a better approach."

miss crawford was not slow to admire; she pretty well guessed miss
bertram's feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote her
enjoyment to the utmost. mrs. norris was all delight and volubility; and
even fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard with
complacency. her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach;
and after being at some pains to get a view of the house, and observing
that "it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with
respect," she added, "now, where is the avenue? the house fronts the
east, i perceive. the avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it. mr.
rushworth talked of the west front."

"yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and
ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. you may see
something of it here--something of the more distant trees. it is oak
entirely."

miss bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had
known nothing about when mr. rushworth had asked her opinion; and her
spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish,
when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal
entrance.



chapter ix

mr. rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the whole
party were welcomed by him with due attention. in the drawing-room they
were met with equal cordiality by the mother, and miss bertram had all
the distinction with each that she could wish. after the business of
arriving was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were
thrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the
appointed dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with abundance
and elegance. much was said, and much was ate, and all went well. the
particular object of the day was then considered. how would mr. crawford
like, in what manner would he chuse, to take a survey of the grounds?
mr. rushworth mentioned his curricle. mr. crawford suggested the greater
desirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two. "to be
depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments,
might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure."

mrs. rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also; but this
was scarcely received as an amendment: the young ladies neither smiled
nor spoke. her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them
as had not been there before, was more acceptable, for miss bertram
was pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing
something.

the whole party rose accordingly, and under mrs. rushworth's guidance
were shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, and
amply furnished in the taste of fifty years back, with shining floors,
solid mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each handsome
in its way. of pictures there were abundance, and some few good, but
the larger part were family portraits, no longer anything to anybody
but mrs. rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all that the
housekeeper could teach, and was now almost equally well qualified to
shew the house. on the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to
miss crawford and fanny, but there was no comparison in the willingness
of their attention; for miss crawford, who had seen scores of great
houses, and cared for none of them, had only the appearance of civilly
listening, while fanny, to whom everything was almost as interesting
as it was new, attended with unaffected earnestness to all that mrs.
rushworth could relate of the family in former times, its rise and
grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts, delighted to connect anything
with history already known, or warm her imagination with scenes of the
past.

the situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect
from any of the rooms; and while fanny and some of the others were
attending mrs. rushworth, henry crawford was looking grave and shaking
his head at the windows. every room on the west front looked across
a lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron
palisades and gates.

having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any
other use than to contribute to the window-tax, and find employment for
housemaids, "now," said mrs. rushworth, "we are coming to the chapel,
which properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; but
as we are quite among friends, i will take you in this way, if you will
excuse me."

they entered. fanny's imagination had prepared her for something
grander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of
devotion: with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion
of mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of
the family gallery above. "i am disappointed," said she, in a low voice,
to edmund. "this is not my idea of a chapel. there is nothing awful
here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. here are no aisles, no arches,
no inscriptions, no banners. no banners, cousin, to be 'blown by the
night wind of heaven.' no signs that a 'scottish monarch sleeps below.'"

"you forget, fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how
confined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and
monasteries. it was only for the private use of the family. they have
been buried, i suppose, in the parish church. _there_ you must look for
the banners and the achievements."

"it was foolish of me not to think of all that; but i am disappointed."

mrs. rushworth began her relation. "this chapel was fitted up as you see
it, in james the second's time. before that period, as i understand,
the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that
the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple
cloth; but this is not quite certain. it is a handsome chapel, and was
formerly in constant use both morning and evening. prayers were always
read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the memory of many; but the
late mr. rushworth left it off."

"every generation has its improvements," said miss crawford, with a
smile, to edmund.

mrs. rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to mr. crawford; and
edmund, fanny, and miss crawford remained in a cluster together.

"it is a pity," cried fanny, "that the custom should have been
discontinued. it was a valuable part of former times. there is something
in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house,
with one's ideas of what such a household should be! a whole family
assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!"

"very fine indeed," said miss crawford, laughing. "it must do the heads
of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and
footmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice
a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away."

"_that_ is hardly fanny's idea of a family assembling," said edmund. "if
the master and mistress do _not_ attend themselves, there must be more
harm than good in the custom."

"at any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such
subjects. everybody likes to go their own way--to chuse their own time
and manner of devotion. the obligation of attendance, the formality, the
restraint, the length of time--altogether it is a formidable thing, and
what nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in
that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men
and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke with a
headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed,
they would have jumped with joy and envy. cannot you imagine with what
unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of rushworth did
many a time repair to this chapel? the young mrs. eleanors and mrs.
bridgets--starched up into seeming piety, but with heads full of
something very different--especially if the poor chaplain were not worth
looking at--and, in those days, i fancy parsons were very inferior even
to what they are now."

for a few moments she was unanswered. fanny coloured and looked
at edmund, but felt too angry for speech; and he needed a little
recollection before he could say, "your lively mind can hardly be
serious even on serious subjects. you have given us an amusing sketch,
and human nature cannot say it was not so. we must all feel _at_ _times_
the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if you are
supposing it a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into a
habit from neglect, what could be expected from the _private_ devotions
of such persons? do you think the minds which are suffered, which
are indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected in a
closet?"

"yes, very likely. they would have two chances at least in their favour.
there would be less to distract the attention from without, and it would
not be tried so long."

"the mind which does not struggle against itself under _one_
circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the _other_, i
believe; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse
better feelings than are begun with. the greater length of the service,
however, i admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. one
wishes it were not so; but i have not yet left oxford long enough to
forget what chapel prayers are."

while this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the
chapel, julia called mr. crawford's attention to her sister, by saying,
"do look at mr. rushworth and maria, standing side by side, exactly as
if the ceremony were going to be performed. have not they completely the
air of it?"

mr. crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to maria,
said, in a voice which she only could hear, "i do not like to see miss
bertram so near the altar."

starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recovering
herself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone not
much louder, "if he would give her away?"

"i am afraid i should do it very awkwardly," was his reply, with a look
of meaning.

julia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.

"upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place
directly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether,
and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant." and she
talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the
comprehension of mr. rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister to
the whispered gallantries of her lover, while mrs. rushworth spoke
with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her
whenever it took place.

"if edmund were but in orders!" cried julia, and running to where he
stood with miss crawford and fanny: "my dear edmund, if you were but in
orders now, you might perform the ceremony directly. how unlucky that
you are not ordained; mr. rushworth and maria are quite ready."

miss crawford's countenance, as julia spoke, might have amused a
disinterested observer. she looked almost aghast under the new idea she
was receiving. fanny pitied her. "how distressed she will be at what she
said just now," passed across her mind.

"ordained!" said miss crawford; "what, are you to be a clergyman?"

"yes; i shall take orders soon after my father's return--probably at
christmas."

miss crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering her complexion,
replied only, "if i had known this before, i would have spoken of the
cloth with more respect," and turned the subject.

the chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness
which reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year. miss
bertram, displeased with her sister, led the way, and all seemed to feel
that they had been there long enough.

the lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and mrs.
rushworth, never weary in the cause, would have proceeded towards the
principal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if her
son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough. "for
if," said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition which many a
clearer head does not always avoid, "we are _too_ long going over the
house, we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. it is
past two, and we are to dine at five."

mrs. rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds,
with the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and mrs.
norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses
most could be done, when the young people, meeting with an outward door,
temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and
shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds, as by one impulse, one
wish for air and liberty, all walked out.

"suppose we turn down here for the present," said mrs. rushworth,
civilly taking the hint and following them. "here are the greatest
number of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants."

"query," said mr. crawford, looking round him, "whether we may not find
something to employ us here before we go farther? i see walls of great
promise. mr. rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?"

"james," said mrs. rushworth to her son, "i believe the wilderness
will be new to all the party. the miss bertrams have never seen the
wilderness yet."

no objection was made, but for some time there seemed no inclination to
move in any plan, or to any distance. all were attracted at first by the
plants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy independence.
mr. crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities
of that end of the house. the lawn, bounded on each side by a high wall,
contained beyond the first planted area a bowling-green, and beyond
the bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed by iron palisades, and
commanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wilderness
immediately adjoining. it was a good spot for fault-finding. mr.
crawford was soon followed by miss bertram and mr. rushworth; and when,
after a little time, the others began to form into parties, these three
were found in busy consultation on the terrace by edmund, miss crawford,
and fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and who, after a short
participation of their regrets and difficulties, left them and walked
on. the remaining three, mrs. rushworth, mrs. norris, and julia, were
still far behind; for julia, whose happy star no longer prevailed,
was obliged to keep by the side of mrs. rushworth, and restrain her
impatient feet to that lady's slow pace, while her aunt, having fallen
in with the housekeeper, who was come out to feed the pheasants, was
lingering behind in gossip with her. poor julia, the only one out of
the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot, was now in a state of
complete penance, and as different from the julia of the barouche-box as
could well be imagined. the politeness which she had been brought up to
practise as a duty made it impossible for her to escape; while the
want of that higher species of self-command, that just consideration of
others, that knowledge of her own heart, that principle of right, which
had not formed any essential part of her education, made her miserable
under it.

"this is insufferably hot," said miss crawford, when they had taken one
turn on the terrace, and were drawing a second time to the door in the
middle which opened to the wilderness. "shall any of us object to being
comfortable? here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it.
what happiness if the door should not be locked! but of course it is;
for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go
where they like."

the door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed in
turning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of day
behind. a considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness,
which was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly of
larch and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid out with too much
regularity, was darkness and shade, and natural beauty, compared with
the bowling-green and the terrace. they all felt the refreshment of it,
and for some time could only walk and admire. at length, after a short
pause, miss crawford began with, "so you are to be a clergyman, mr.
bertram. this is rather a surprise to me."

"why should it surprise you? you must suppose me designed for some
profession, and might perceive that i am neither a lawyer, nor a
soldier, nor a sailor."

"very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. and you know there
is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second
son."

"a very praiseworthy practice," said edmund, "but not quite universal.
i am one of the exceptions, and _being_ one, must do something for
myself."

"but why are you to be a clergyman? i thought _that_ was always the lot
of the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him."

"do you think the church itself never chosen, then?"

"_never_ is a black word. but yes, in the _never_ of conversation, which
means _not_ _very_ _often_, i do think it. for what is to be done in the
church? men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other
lines distinction may be gained, but not in the church. a clergyman is
nothing."

"the _nothing_ of conversation has its gradations, i hope, as well as
the _never_. a clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion. he must
not head mobs, or set the ton in dress. but i cannot call that situation
nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance
to mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and
eternally, which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and
consequently of the manners which result from their influence. no one
here can call the _office_ nothing. if the man who holds it is so, it
is by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance, and
stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear."

"_you_ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been
used to hear given, or than i can quite comprehend. one does not see
much of this influence and importance in society, and how can it be
acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves? how can two sermons a
week, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have
the sense to prefer blair's to his own, do all that you speak of? govern
the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest
of the week? one scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit."

"_you_ are speaking of london, _i_ am speaking of the nation at large."

"the metropolis, i imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest."

"not, i should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the
kingdom. we do not look in great cities for our best morality. it is not
there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and
it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most
felt. a fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in fine
preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and
his neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size
capable of knowing his private character, and observing his general
conduct, which in london can rarely be the case. the clergy are lost
there in the crowds of their parishioners. they are known to the largest
part only as preachers. and with regard to their influencing public
manners, miss crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose i mean to
call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of refinement
and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life. the _manners_ i
speak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the result of good
principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines which it is their
duty to teach and recommend; and it will, i believe, be everywhere
found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so are
the rest of the nation."

"certainly," said fanny, with gentle earnestness.

"there," cried miss crawford, "you have quite convinced miss price
already."

"i wish i could convince miss crawford too."

"i do not think you ever will," said she, with an arch smile; "i am just
as much surprised now as i was at first that you should intend to take
orders. you really are fit for something better. come, do change your
mind. it is not too late. go into the law."

"go into the law! with as much ease as i was told to go into this
wilderness."

"now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness
of the two, but i forestall you; remember, i have forestalled you."

"you need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a
_bon_ _mot_, for there is not the least wit in my nature. i am a very
matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a
repartee for half an hour together without striking it out."

a general silence succeeded. each was thoughtful. fanny made the first
interruption by saying, "i wonder that i should be tired with only
walking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it
is not disagreeable to you, i should be glad to sit down for a little
while."

"my dear fanny," cried edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his,
"how thoughtless i have been! i hope you are not very tired. perhaps,"
turning to miss crawford, "my other companion may do me the honour of
taking an arm."

"thank you, but i am not at all tired." she took it, however, as she
spoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a
connexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of fanny.
"you scarcely touch me," said he. "you do not make me of any use. what a
difference in the weight of a woman's arm from that of a man! at oxford
i have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of
a street, and you are only a fly in the comparison."

"i am really not tired, which i almost wonder at; for we must have
walked at least a mile in this wood. do not you think we have?"

"not half a mile," was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in
love as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.

"oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. we have taken
such a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile
long in a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet since
we left the first great path."

"but if you remember, before we left that first great path, we saw
directly to the end of it. we looked down the whole vista, and saw it
closed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong in
length."

"oh! i know nothing of your furlongs, but i am sure it is a very long
wood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into
it; and therefore, when i say that we have walked a mile in it, i must
speak within compass."

"we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here," said edmund, taking
out his watch. "do you think we are walking four miles an hour?"

"oh! do not attack me with your watch. a watch is always too fast or too
slow. i cannot be dictated to by a watch."

a few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they
had been talking of; and standing back, well shaded and sheltered, and
looking over a ha-ha into the park, was a comfortable-sized bench, on
which they all sat down.

"i am afraid you are very tired, fanny," said edmund, observing her;
"why would not you speak sooner? this will be a bad day's amusement for
you if you are to be knocked up. every sort of exercise fatigues her so
soon, miss crawford, except riding."

"how abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as i did all
last week! i am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen
again."

"_your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own
neglect. fanny's interest seems in safer hands with you than with me."

"that she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there
is nothing in the course of one's duties so fatiguing as what we have
been doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to
another, straining one's eyes and one's attention, hearing what one does
not understand, admiring what one does not care for. it is generally
allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and miss price has found
it so, though she did not know it."

"i shall soon be rested," said fanny; "to sit in the shade on a fine
day, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment."

after sitting a little while miss crawford was up again. "i must move,"
said she; "resting fatigues me. i have looked across the ha-ha till i
am weary. i must go and look through that iron gate at the same view,
without being able to see it so well."

edmund left the seat likewise. "now, miss crawford, if you will look up
the walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long,
or half half a mile."

"it is an immense distance," said she; "i see _that_ with a glance."

he still reasoned with her, but in vain. she would not calculate, she
would not compare. she would only smile and assert. the greatest degree
of rational consistency could not have been more engaging, and they
talked with mutual satisfaction. at last it was agreed that they should
endeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little
more about it. they would go to one end of it, in the line they were
then in--for there was a straight green walk along the bottom by
the side of the ha-ha--and perhaps turn a little way in some other
direction, if it seemed likely to assist them, and be back in a few
minutes. fanny said she was rested, and would have moved too, but this
was not suffered. edmund urged her remaining where she was with an
earnestness which she could not resist, and she was left on the bench to
think with pleasure of her cousin's care, but with great regret that she
was not stronger. she watched them till they had turned the corner, and
listened till all sound of them had ceased.



chapter x

a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and fanny was still
thinking of edmund, miss crawford, and herself, without interruption
from any one. she began to be surprised at being left so long, and to
listen with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices
again. she listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feet
approaching; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those
she wanted, when miss bertram, mr. rushworth, and mr. crawford issued
from the same path which she had trod herself, and were before her.

"miss price all alone" and "my dear fanny, how comes this?" were the
first salutations. she told her story. "poor dear fanny," cried her
cousin, "how ill you have been used by them! you had better have staid
with us."

then seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she resumed
the conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed the
possibility of improvements with much animation. nothing was fixed
on; but henry crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally
speaking, whatever he proposed was immediately approved, first by her,
and then by mr. rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to
hear the others, and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own
beyond a wish that they had seen his friend smith's place.

after some minutes spent in this way, miss bertram, observing the iron
gate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that their
views and their plans might be more comprehensive. it was the very thing
of all others to be wished, it was the best, it was the only way of
proceeding with any advantage, in henry crawford's opinion; and he
directly saw a knoll not half a mile off, which would give them exactly
the requisite command of the house. go therefore they must to that
knoll, and through that gate; but the gate was locked. mr. rushworth
wished he had brought the key; he had been very near thinking whether he
should not bring the key; he was determined he would never come without
the key again; but still this did not remove the present evil. they
could not get through; and as miss bertram's inclination for so doing
did by no means lessen, it ended in mr. rushworth's declaring outright
that he would go and fetch the key. he set off accordingly.

"it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from
the house already," said mr. crawford, when he was gone.

"yes, there is nothing else to be done. but now, sincerely, do not you
find the place altogether worse than you expected?"

"no, indeed, far otherwise. i find it better, grander, more complete in
its style, though that style may not be the best. and to tell you the
truth," speaking rather lower, "i do not think that _i_ shall ever see
sotherton again with so much pleasure as i do now. another summer will
hardly improve it to me."

after a moment's embarrassment the lady replied, "you are too much a
man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. if other people
think sotherton improved, i have no doubt that you will."

"i am afraid i am not quite so much the man of the world as might be
good for me in some points. my feelings are not quite so evanescent, nor
my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the
case with men of the world."

this was followed by a short silence. miss bertram began again. "you
seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. i was glad to
see you so well entertained. you and julia were laughing the whole way."

"were we? yes, i believe we were; but i have not the least recollection
at what. oh! i believe i was relating to her some ridiculous stories of
an old irish groom of my uncle's. your sister loves to laugh."

"you think her more light-hearted than i am?"

"more easily amused," he replied; "consequently, you know," smiling,
"better company. i could not have hoped to entertain you with irish
anecdotes during a ten miles' drive."

"naturally, i believe, i am as lively as julia, but i have more to think
of now."

"you have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high
spirits would denote insensibility. your prospects, however, are too
fair to justify want of spirits. you have a very smiling scene before
you."

"do you mean literally or figuratively? literally, i conclude. yes,
certainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. but
unluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and
hardship. 'i cannot get out,' as the starling said." as she spoke, and
it was with expression, she walked to the gate: he followed her. "mr.
rushworth is so long fetching this key!"

"and for the world you would not get out without the key and without mr.
rushworth's authority and protection, or i think you might with little
difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance;
i think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, and
could allow yourself to think it not prohibited."

"prohibited! nonsense! i certainly can get out that way, and i will.
mr. rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out of
sight."

"or if we are, miss price will be so good as to tell him that he will
find us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll."

fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort to
prevent it. "you will hurt yourself, miss bertram," she cried; "you will
certainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown;
you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. you had better not
go."

her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken,
and, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she said, "thank you,
my dear fanny, but i and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye."

fanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase of pleasant
feelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard,
astonished at miss bertram, and angry with mr. crawford. by taking
a circuitous route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable
direction to the knoll, they were soon beyond her eye; and for some
minutes longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion.
she seemed to have the little wood all to herself. she could almost
have thought that edmund and miss crawford had left it, but that it was
impossible for edmund to forget her so entirely.

she was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:
somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk. she
expected mr. rushworth, but it was julia, who, hot and out of breath,
and with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, "heyday!
where are the others? i thought maria and mr. crawford were with you."

fanny explained.

"a pretty trick, upon my word! i cannot see them anywhere," looking
eagerly into the park. "but they cannot be very far off, and i think i
am equal to as much as maria, even without help."

"but, julia, mr. rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. do
wait for mr. rushworth."

"not i, indeed. i have had enough of the family for one morning. why,
child, i have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother. such a
penance as i have been enduring, while you were sitting here so composed
and so happy! it might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in my
place, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes."

this was a most unjust reflection, but fanny could allow for it, and let
it pass: julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt that it
would not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her if she
had not seen mr. rushworth.

"yes, yes, we saw him. he was posting away as if upon life and death,
and could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all
were."

"it is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing."

"_that_ is miss maria's concern. i am not obliged to punish myself for
_her_ sins. the mother i could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt
was dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son i _can_ get away
from."

and she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not
attending to fanny's last question of whether she had seen anything of
miss crawford and edmund. the sort of dread in which fanny now sat of
seeing mr. rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued
absence, however, as she might have done. she felt that he had been
very ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had
passed. he joined her within five minutes after julia's exit; and
though she made the best of the story, he was evidently mortified and
displeased in no common degree. at first he scarcely said anything; his
looks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked to
the gate and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.

"they desired me to stay--my cousin maria charged me to say that you
would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts."

"i do not believe i shall go any farther," said he sullenly; "i see
nothing of them. by the time i get to the knoll they may be gone
somewhere else. i have had walking enough."

and he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by fanny.

"i am very sorry," said she; "it is very unlucky." and she longed to be
able to say something more to the purpose.

after an interval of silence, "i think they might as well have staid for
me," said he.

"miss bertram thought you would follow her."

"i should not have had to follow her if she had staid."

this could not be denied, and fanny was silenced. after another pause,
he went on--"pray, miss price, are you such a great admirer of this mr.
crawford as some people are? for my part, i can see nothing in him."

"i do not think him at all handsome."

"handsome! nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. he is not
five foot nine. i should not wonder if he is not more than five foot
eight. i think he is an ill-looking fellow. in my opinion, these
crawfords are no addition at all. we did very well without them."

a small sigh escaped fanny here, and she did not know how to contradict
him.

"if i had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have
been some excuse, but i went the very moment she said she wanted it."

"nothing could be more obliging than your manner, i am sure, and i dare
say you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you
know, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when people
are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seems
like five."

he got up and walked to the gate again, and "wished he had had the key
about him at the time." fanny thought she discerned in his standing
there an indication of relenting, which encouraged her to another
attempt, and she said, therefore, "it is a pity you should not join
them. they expected to have a better view of the house from that part
of the park, and will be thinking how it may be improved; and nothing of
that sort, you know, can be settled without you."

she found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a
companion. mr. rushworth was worked on. "well," said he, "if you
really think i had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key
for nothing." and letting himself out, he walked off without farther
ceremony.

fanny's thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so
long ago, and getting quite impatient, she resolved to go in search
of them. she followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had just
turned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of miss crawford
once more caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings
brought them before her. they were just returned into the wilderness
from the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very
soon after their leaving her, and they had been across a portion of the
park into the very avenue which fanny had been hoping the whole morning
to reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees. this
was their history. it was evident that they had been spending their time
pleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their absence. fanny's
best consolation was in being assured that edmund had wished for her
very much, and that he should certainly have come back for her, had she
not been tired already; but this was not quite sufficient to do away
with the pain of having been left a whole hour, when he had talked of
only a few minutes, nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know
what they had been conversing about all that time; and the result of
the whole was to her disappointment and depression, as they prepared by
general agreement to return to the house.

on reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, mrs. rushworth
and mrs. norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the
wilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the
house. mrs. norris had been too well employed to move faster. whatever
cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces,
she had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper,
after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken her
to the dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt
for a famous cream cheese; and since julia's leaving them they had
been met by the gardener, with whom she had made a most satisfactory
acquaintance, for she had set him right as to his grandson's illness,
convinced him that it was an ague, and promised him a charm for it; and
he, in return, had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants, and
actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath.

on this _rencontre_ they all returned to the house together, there
to lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and
quarterly reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of
dinner. it was late before the miss bertrams and the two gentlemen came
in, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially
agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the
object of the day. by their own accounts they had been all walking after
each other, and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, to
fanny's observation, to have been as much too late for re-establishing
harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration.
she felt, as she looked at julia and mr. rushworth, that hers was not
the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was gloom on the face of
each. mr. crawford and miss bertram were much more gay, and she thought
that he was taking particular pains, during dinner, to do away any
little resentment of the other two, and restore general good-humour.

dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles' drive home
allowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to
table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came
to the door, and mrs. norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a
few pheasants' eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made
abundance of civil speeches to mrs. rushworth, was ready to lead the
way. at the same moment mr. crawford, approaching julia, said, "i hope i
am not to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air
in so exposed a seat." the request had not been foreseen, but was very
graciously received, and julia's day was likely to end almost as well as
it began. miss bertram had made up her mind to something different, and
was a little disappointed; but her conviction of being really the
one preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her to receive mr.
rushworth's parting attentions as she ought. he was certainly better
pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending
the box, and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.

"well, fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word," said
mrs. norris, as they drove through the park. "nothing but pleasure from
beginning to end! i am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your
aunt bertram and me for contriving to let you go. a pretty good day's
amusement you have had!"

maria was just discontented enough to say directly, "i think _you_ have
done pretty well yourself, ma'am. your lap seems full of good things,
and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my
elbow unmercifully."

"my dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old
gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, i will have it in
my lap directly. there, fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me; take
great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like
the excellent one we had at dinner. nothing would satisfy that good old
mrs. whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. i stood out as long
as i could, till the tears almost came into her eyes, and i knew it was
just the sort that my sister would be delighted with. that mrs. whitaker
is a treasure! she was quite shocked when i asked her whether wine was
allowed at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids for
wearing white gowns. take care of the cheese, fanny. now i can manage
the other parcel and the basket very well."

"what else have you been spunging?" said maria, half-pleased that
sotherton should be so complimented.

"spunging, my dear! it is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants'
eggs, which mrs. whitaker would quite force upon me: she would not take
a denial. she said it must be such an amusement to me, as she understood
i lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort; and
so to be sure it will. i shall get the dairymaid to set them under the
first spare hen, and if they come to good i can have them moved to my
own house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great delight to me in
my lonely hours to attend to them. and if i have good luck, your mother
shall have some."

it was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was as
pleasant as the serenity of nature could make it; but when mrs. norris
ceased speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within. their
spirits were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the day had
afforded most pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of almost
all.



chapter xi

the day at sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the miss
bertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the letters
from antigua, which soon afterwards reached mansfield. it was much
pleasanter to think of henry crawford than of their father; and to think
of their father in england again within a certain period, which these
letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.

november was the black month fixed for his return. sir thomas wrote of
it with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. his
business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take
his passage in the september packet, and he consequently looked forward
with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in november.

maria was more to be pitied than julia; for to her the father brought a
husband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness
would unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness
should depend. it was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to
throw a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she should
see something else. it would hardly be _early_ in november, there
were generally delays, a bad passage or _something_; that favouring
_something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or
their understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. it would
probably be the middle of november at least; the middle of november
was three months off. three months comprised thirteen weeks. much might
happen in thirteen weeks.

sir thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that
his daughters felt on the subject of his return, and would hardly have
found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the
breast of another young lady. miss crawford, on walking up with her
brother to spend the evening at mansfield park, heard the good news; and
though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness, and
to have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it with
an attention not so easily satisfied. mrs. norris gave the particulars
of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea, as miss
crawford was standing at an open window with edmund and fanny looking
out on a twilight scene, while the miss bertrams, mr. rushworth,
and henry crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte, she
suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group, and saying, "how
happy mr. rushworth looks! he is thinking of november."

edmund looked round at mr. rushworth too, but had nothing to say.

"your father's return will be a very interesting event."

"it will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but
including so many dangers."

"it will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your
sister's marriage, and your taking orders."

"yes."

"don't be affronted," said she, laughing, "but it does put me in mind of
some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in
a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return."

"there is no sacrifice in the case," replied edmund, with a serious
smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; "it is entirely her own
doing."

"oh yes i know it is. i was merely joking. she has done no more than
what every young woman would do; and i have no doubt of her being
extremely happy. my other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand."

"my taking orders, i assure you, is quite as voluntary as maria's
marrying."

"it is fortunate that your inclination and your father's convenience
should accord so well. there is a very good living kept for you, i
understand, hereabouts."

"which you suppose has biassed me?"

"but _that_ i am sure it has not," cried fanny.

"thank you for your good word, fanny, but it is more than i would affirm
myself. on the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for
me probably did bias me. nor can i think it wrong that it should. there
was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and i see no reason why
a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a
competence early in life. i was in safe hands. i hope i should not have
been influenced myself in a wrong way, and i am sure my father was too
conscientious to have allowed it. i have no doubt that i was biased, but
i think it was blamelessly."

"it is the same sort of thing," said fanny, after a short pause, "as for
the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be
in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. nobody wonders that
they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, or
suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear."

"no, my dear miss price, and for reasons good. the profession, either
navy or army, is its own justification. it has everything in its favour:
heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. soldiers and sailors are always
acceptable in society. nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and
sailors."

"but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of
preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?" said edmund. "to be
justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty
of any provision."

"what! take orders without a living! no; that is madness indeed;
absolute madness."

"shall i ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to
take orders with a living nor without? no; for you certainly would not
know what to say. but i must beg some advantage to the clergyman from
your own argument. as he cannot be influenced by those feelings which
you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in
their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are
all against him, he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting
sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his."

"oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made,
to the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing
nothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat. it is
indolence, mr. bertram, indeed. indolence and love of ease; a want of
all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination
to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen.
a clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish--read the
newspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife. his curate does
all the work, and the business of his own life is to dine."

"there are such clergymen, no doubt, but i think they are not so common
as to justify miss crawford in esteeming it their general character. i
suspect that in this comprehensive and (may i say) commonplace censure,
you are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose
opinions you have been in the habit of hearing. it is impossible that
your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy.
you can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men
you condemn so conclusively. you are speaking what you have been told at
your uncle's table."

"i speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion
is general, it is usually correct. though _i_ have not seen much of
the domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any
deficiency of information."

"where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are
condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,
or (smiling) of something else. your uncle, and his brother admirals,
perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad,
they were always wishing away."

"poor william! he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the
antwerp," was a tender apostrophe of fanny's, very much to the purpose
of her own feelings if not of the conversation.

"i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,"
said miss crawford, "that i can hardly suppose--and since you push me so
hard, i must observe, that i am not entirely without the means of seeing
what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my own
brother, dr. grant. and though dr. grant is most kind and obliging to
me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, i dare say, a good scholar
and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable,
_i_ see him to be an indolent, selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who must have
his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for the
convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder,
is out of humour with his excellent wife. to own the truth, henry and
i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a
green goose, which he could not get the better of. my poor sister was
forced to stay and bear it."

"i do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. it is a great
defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence;
and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to
such feelings as yours. fanny, it goes against us. we cannot attempt to
defend dr. grant."

"no," replied fanny, "but we need not give up his profession for all
that; because, whatever profession dr. grant had chosen, he would have
taken a--not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy
or army, have had a great many more people under his command than he
has now, i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or
soldier than as a clergyman. besides, i cannot but suppose that whatever
there may be to wish otherwise in dr. grant would have been in a greater
danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, where
he would have had less time and obligation--where he might have escaped
that knowledge of himself, the _frequency_, at least, of that knowledge
which it is impossible he should escape as he is now. a man--a sensible
man like dr. grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty
every week, cannot go to church twice every sunday, and preach such very
good sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being the better
for it himself. it must make him think; and i have no doubt that he
oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been
anything but a clergyman."

"we cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but i wish you a better
fate, miss price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness
depends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a
good-humour every sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling
about green geese from monday morning till saturday night."

"i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny," said edmund
affectionately, "must be beyond the reach of any sermons."

fanny turned farther into the window; and miss crawford had only time
to say, in a pleasant manner, "i fancy miss price has been more used to
deserve praise than to hear it"; when, being earnestly invited by the
miss bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,
leaving edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her
many virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful
tread.

"there goes good-humour, i am sure," said he presently. "there goes a
temper which would never give pain! how well she walks! and how readily
she falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment she
is asked. what a pity," he added, after an instant's reflection, "that
she should have been in such hands!"

fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the
window with her, in spite of the expected glee; and of having his eyes
soon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that was
solemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an
unclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. fanny
spoke her feelings. "here's harmony!" said she; "here's repose! here's
what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only
can attempt to describe! here's what may tranquillise every care, and
lift the heart to rapture! when i look out on such a night as this, i
feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;
and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature
were more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by
contemplating such a scene."

"i like to hear your enthusiasm, fanny. it is a lovely night, and they
are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree,
as you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for nature in
early life. they lose a great deal."

"_you_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin."

"i had a very apt scholar. there's arcturus looking very bright."

"yes, and the bear. i wish i could see cassiopeia."

"we must go out on the lawn for that. should you be afraid?"

"not in the least. it is a great while since we have had any
star-gazing."

"yes; i do not know how it has happened." the glee began. "we will stay
till this is finished, fanny," said he, turning his back on the window;
and as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance too,
moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when it
ceased, he was close by the singers, among the most urgent in requesting
to hear the glee again.

fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by mrs. norris's
threats of catching cold.



chapter xii

sir thomas was to return in november, and his eldest son had duties to
call him earlier home. the approach of september brought tidings of mr.
bertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter
to edmund; and by the end of august he arrived himself, to be gay,
agreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or miss crawford
demanded; to tell of races and weymouth, and parties and friends, to
which she might have listened six weeks before with some interest, and
altogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actual
comparison, of her preferring his younger brother.

it was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it was;
and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even want
to attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty
required: his lengthened absence from mansfield, without anything but
pleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear
that he did not care about her; and his indifference was so much more
than equalled by her own, that were he now to step forth the owner of
mansfield park, the sir thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she
did not believe she could accept him.

the season and duties which brought mr. bertram back to mansfield took
mr. crawford into norfolk. everingham could not do without him in the
beginning of september. he went for a fortnight--a fortnight of such
dullness to the miss bertrams as ought to have put them both on their
guard, and made even julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, the
absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him not
to return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of
shooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he ought
to keep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his own
motives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was
tending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example,
he would not look beyond the present moment. the sisters, handsome,
clever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind; and
finding nothing in norfolk to equal the social pleasures of mansfield,
he gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed thither
quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with further.

maria, with only mr. rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the
repeated details of his day's sport, good or bad, his boast of his dogs,
his jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their qualifications,
and his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not find their way to
female feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on
the other, had missed mr. crawford grievously; and julia, unengaged and
unemployed, felt all the right of missing him much more. each sister
believed herself the favourite. julia might be justified in so doing by
the hints of mrs. grant, inclined to credit what she wished, and maria
by the hints of mr. crawford himself. everything returned into the same
channel as before his absence; his manners being to each so animated and
agreeable as to lose no ground with either, and just stopping short of
the consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which
might excite general notice.

fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; but
since the day at sotherton, she could never see mr. crawford with either
sister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure; and
had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it
in every other respect, had she been sure that she was seeing clearly,
and judging candidly, she would probably have made some important
communications to her usual confidant. as it was, however, she only
hazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. "i am rather surprised," said
she, "that mr. crawford should come back again so soon, after being here
so long before, full seven weeks; for i had understood he was so
very fond of change and moving about, that i thought something would
certainly occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere. he is
used to much gayer places than mansfield."

"it is to his credit," was edmund's answer; "and i dare say it gives his
sister pleasure. she does not like his unsettled habits."

"what a favourite he is with my cousins!"

"yes, his manners to women are such as must please. mrs. grant, i
believe, suspects him of a preference for julia; i have never seen much
symptom of it, but i wish it may be so. he has no faults but what a
serious attachment would remove."

"if miss bertram were not engaged," said fanny cautiously, "i could
sometimes almost think that he admired her more than julia."

"which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking julia best, than you,
fanny, may be aware; for i believe it often happens that a man, before
he has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or
intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the
woman herself. crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found
himself in any danger from maria; and i am not at all afraid for her,
after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong."

fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think
differently in future; but with all that submission to edmund could
do, and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she
occasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say that
julia was mr. crawford's choice, she knew not always what to think. she
was privy, one evening, to the hopes of her aunt norris on the subject,
as well as to her feelings, and the feelings of mrs. rushworth, on a
point of some similarity, and could not help wondering as she listened;
and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen, for it was
while all the other young people were dancing, and she sitting,
most unwillingly, among the chaperons at the fire, longing for the
re-entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own hopes of a partner
then depended. it was fanny's first ball, though without the preparation
or splendour of many a young lady's first ball, being the thought only
of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of a violin player in
the servants' hall, and the possibility of raising five couple with
the help of mrs. grant and a new intimate friend of mr. bertram's just
arrived on a visit. it had, however, been a very happy one to fanny
through four dances, and she was quite grieved to be losing even a
quarter of an hour. while waiting and wishing, looking now at
the dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two
above-mentioned ladies was forced on her--

"i think, ma'am," said mrs. norris, her eyes directed towards mr.
rushworth and maria, who were partners for the second time, "we shall
see some happy faces again now."

"yes, ma'am, indeed," replied the other, with a stately simper, "there
will be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and i think it was rather
a pity they should have been obliged to part. young folks in their
situation should be excused complying with the common forms. i wonder my
son did not propose it."

"i dare say he did, ma'am. mr. rushworth is never remiss. but dear maria
has such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacy
which one seldom meets with nowadays, mrs. rushworth--that wish of
avoiding particularity! dear ma'am, only look at her face at this
moment; how different from what it was the two last dances!"

miss bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling with
pleasure, and she was speaking with great animation, for julia and her
partner, mr. crawford, were close to her; they were all in a cluster
together. how she had looked before, fanny could not recollect, for she
had been dancing with edmund herself, and had not thought about her.

mrs. norris continued, "it is quite delightful, ma'am, to see young
people so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! i
cannot but think of dear sir thomas's delight. and what do you say,
ma'am, to the chance of another match? mr. rushworth has set a good
example, and such things are very catching."

mrs. rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite at a loss.

"the couple above, ma'am. do you see no symptoms there?"

"oh dear! miss julia and mr. crawford. yes, indeed, a very pretty match.
what is his property?"

"four thousand a year."

"very well. those who have not more must be satisfied with what they
have. four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he seems a very
genteel, steady young man, so i hope miss julia will be very happy."

"it is not a settled thing, ma'am, yet. we only speak of it among
friends. but i have very little doubt it _will_ be. he is growing
extremely particular in his attentions."

fanny could listen no farther. listening and wondering were all
suspended for a time, for mr. bertram was in the room again; and though
feeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it
must happen. he came towards their little circle; but instead of asking
her to dance, drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the
present state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, from
whom he had just parted. fanny found that it was not to be, and in the
modesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable
in expecting it. when he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper from
the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, "if you want to
dance, fanny, i will stand up with you." with more than equal civility
the offer was declined; she did not wish to dance. "i am glad of it,"
said he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the newspaper again,
"for i am tired to death. i only wonder how the good people can keep
it up so long. they had need be _all_ in love, to find any amusement in
such folly; and so they are, i fancy. if you look at them you may see
they are so many couple of lovers--all but yates and mrs. grant--and,
between ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a lover as much as any one
of them. a desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor," making
a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter, who proving,
however, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous a change of
expression and subject necessary, as fanny, in spite of everything,
could hardly help laughing at. "a strange business this in america, dr.
grant! what is your opinion? i always come to you to know what i am to
think of public matters."

"my dear tom," cried his aunt soon afterwards, "as you are not dancing,
i dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall
you?" then leaving her seat, and coming to him to enforce the proposal,
added in a whisper, "we want to make a table for mrs. rushworth, you
know. your mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well spare
time to sit down herself, because of her fringe. now, you and i and dr.
grant will just do; and though _we_ play but half-crowns, you know, you
may bet half-guineas with _him_."

"i should be most happy," replied he aloud, and jumping up with
alacrity, "it would give me the greatest pleasure; but that i am
this moment going to dance." come, fanny, taking her hand, "do not be
dawdling any longer, or the dance will be over."

fanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her to
feel much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainly
did, between the selfishness of another person and his own.

"a pretty modest request upon my word," he indignantly exclaimed as they
walked away. "to want to nail me to a card-table for the next two hours
with herself and dr. grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking
old woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. i wish my good
aunt would be a little less busy! and to ask me in such a way too!
without ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibility
of refusing. _that_ is what i dislike most particularly. it raises my
spleen more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, of
being given a choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way as
to oblige one to do the very thing, whatever it be! if i had not luckily
thought of standing up with you i could not have got out of it. it is
a great deal too bad. but when my aunt has got a fancy in her head,
nothing can stop her."



chapter xiii

the honourable john yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend
him beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son of
a lord with a tolerable independence; and sir thomas would probably
have thought his introduction at mansfield by no means desirable. mr.
bertram's acquaintance with him had begun at weymouth, where they had
spent ten days together in the same society, and the friendship, if
friendship it might be called, had been proved and perfected by mr.
yates's being invited to take mansfield in his way, whenever he could,
and by his promising to come; and he did come rather earlier than had
been expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large party
assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had left
weymouth to join. he came on the wings of disappointment, and with his
head full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the play
in which he had borne a part was within two days of representation,
when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family
had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers. to be so near
happiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in praise of the
private theatricals at ecclesford, the seat of the right hon. lord
ravenshaw, in cornwall, which would of course have immortalised the
whole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being so near, to lose
it all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and mr. yates could talk of
nothing else. ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements and
dresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his never-failing subject, and to
boast of the past his only consolation.

happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting
so strong among young people, that he could hardly out-talk the interest
of his hearers. from the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it
was all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been a
party concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. the play
had been lovers' vows, and mr. yates was to have been count cassel. "a
trifling part," said he, "and not at all to my taste, and such a one
as i certainly would not accept again; but i was determined to make no
difficulties. lord ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two
characters worth playing before i reached ecclesford; and though lord
ravenshaw offered to resign his to me, it was impossible to take it, you
know. i was sorry for _him_ that he should have so mistaken his powers,
for he was no more equal to the baron--a little man with a weak voice,
always hoarse after the first ten minutes. it must have injured the
piece materially; but _i_ was resolved to make no difficulties. sir
henry thought the duke not equal to frederick, but that was because
sir henry wanted the part himself; whereas it was certainly in the best
hands of the two. i was surprised to see sir henry such a stick. luckily
the strength of the piece did not depend upon him. our agatha was
inimitable, and the duke was thought very great by many. and upon the
whole, it would certainly have gone off wonderfully."

"it was a hard case, upon my word"; and, "i do think you were very much
to be pitied," were the kind responses of listening sympathy.

"it is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager
could not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to help
wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days
we wanted. it was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and all
happening two hundred miles off, i think there would have been no great
harm, and it was suggested, i know; but lord ravenshaw, who i suppose is
one of the most correct men in england, would not hear of it."

"an afterpiece instead of a comedy," said mr. bertram. "lovers' vows
were at an end, and lord and lady ravenshaw left to act my grandmother
by themselves. well, the jointure may comfort _him_; and perhaps,
between friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the
baron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make _you_ amends, yates, i
think we must raise a little theatre at mansfield, and ask you to be our
manager."

this, though the thought of the moment, did not end with the moment; for
the inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly than in
him who was now master of the house; and who, having so much leisure as
to make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such a degree of
lively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the novelty
of acting. the thought returned again and again. "oh for the ecclesford
theatre and scenery to try something with." each sister could echo the
wish; and henry crawford, to whom, in all the riot of his gratifications
it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea. "i really
believe," said he, "i could be fool enough at this moment to undertake
any character that ever was written, from shylock or richard iii down to
the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. i feel
as if i could be anything or everything; as if i could rant and storm,
or sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the english language.
let us be doing something. be it only half a play, an act, a scene; what
should prevent us? not these countenances, i am sure," looking towards
the miss bertrams; "and for a theatre, what signifies a theatre? we
shall be only amusing ourselves. any room in this house might suffice."

"we must have a curtain," said tom bertram; "a few yards of green baize
for a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough."

"oh, quite enough," cried mr. yates, "with only just a side wing or two
run up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothing
more would be necessary on such a plan as this. for mere amusement among
ourselves we should want nothing more."

"i believe we must be satisfied with _less_," said maria. "there would
not be time, and other difficulties would arise. we must rather adopt
mr. crawford's views, and make the _performance_, not the _theatre_, our
object. many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery."

"nay," said edmund, who began to listen with alarm. "let us do nothing
by halves. if we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted
up with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from
beginning to end; so as it be a german play, no matter what, with a good
tricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe, and a
song between the acts. if we do not outdo ecclesford, we do nothing."

"now, edmund, do not be disagreeable," said julia. "nobody loves a play
better than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one."

"true, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but i would hardly
walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who
have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have
all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through."

after a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was
discussed with unabated eagerness, every one's inclination increasing
by the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and
though nothing was settled but that tom bertram would prefer a comedy,
and his sisters and henry crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the
world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all,
the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to
make edmund quite uncomfortable. he was determined to prevent it, if
possible, though his mother, who equally heard the conversation which
passed at table, did not evince the least disapprobation.

the same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength.
maria, julia, henry crawford, and mr. yates were in the billiard-room.
tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where edmund was
standing thoughtfully by the fire, while lady bertram was on the sofa at
a little distance, and fanny close beside her arranging her work, thus
began as he entered--"such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours is not
to be met with, i believe, above ground. i can stand it no longer, and i
think, i may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but one
good thing i have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre,
precisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at the farther
end, communicating with each other, as they may be made to do in five
minutes, by merely moving the bookcase in my father's room, is the very
thing we could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; and
my father's room will be an excellent greenroom. it seems to join the
billiard-room on purpose."

"you are not serious, tom, in meaning to act?" said edmund, in a low
voice, as his brother approached the fire.

"not serious! never more so, i assure you. what is there to surprise you
in it?"

"i think it would be very wrong. in a _general_ light, private
theatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_ are circumstanced,
i must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudicious
to attempt anything of the kind. it would shew great want of feeling
on my father's account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant
danger; and it would be imprudent, i think, with regard to maria, whose
situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely
delicate."

"you take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act three
times a week till my father's return, and invite all the country. but
it is not to be a display of that sort. we mean nothing but a little
amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our
powers in something new. we want no audience, no publicity. we may be
trusted, i think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable;
and i can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing
in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in
chattering in words of our own. i have no fears and no scruples. and
as to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that i
consider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his return must
be a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be the means of
amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks,
i shall think our time very well spent, and so, i am sure, will he. it
is a _very_ anxious period for her."

as he said this, each looked towards their mother. lady bertram, sunk
back in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease,
and tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while fanny was
getting through the few difficulties of her work for her.

edmund smiled and shook his head.

"by jove! this won't do," cried tom, throwing himself into a chair with
a hearty laugh. "to be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety--i was unlucky
there."

"what is the matter?" asked her ladyship, in the heavy tone of one
half-roused; "i was not asleep."

"oh dear, no, ma'am, nobody suspected you! well, edmund," he continued,
returning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as lady
bertram began to nod again, "but _this_ i _will_ maintain, that we shall
be doing no harm."

"i cannot agree with you; i am convinced that my father would totally
disapprove it."

"and i am convinced to the contrary. nobody is fonder of the exercise
of talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for
anything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, i think he has always a
decided taste. i am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. how many a time
have we mourned over the dead body of julius caesar, and to _be'd_ and
not _to_ _be'd_, in this very room, for his amusement? and i am sure,
_my_ _name_ _was_ _norval_, every evening of my life through one
christmas holidays."

"it was a very different thing. you must see the difference yourself. my
father wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never
wish his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. his sense of decorum is
strict."

"i know all that," said tom, displeased. "i know my father as well as
you do; and i'll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress
him. manage your own concerns, edmund, and i'll take care of the rest of
the family."

"if you are resolved on acting," replied the persevering edmund, "i must
hope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and i think a theatre
ought not to be attempted. it would be taking liberties with my father's
house in his absence which could not be justified."

"for everything of that nature i will be answerable," said tom, in a
decided tone. "his house shall not be hurt. i have quite as great an
interest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to such
alterations as i was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or
unlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a
week without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose
he would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the
breakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister's
pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. absolute
nonsense!"

"the innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an
expense."

"yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! perhaps
it might cost a whole twenty pounds. something of a theatre we must have
undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a
little carpenter's work, and that's all; and as the carpenter's work
may be all done at home by christopher jackson himself, it will be
too absurd to talk of expense; and as long as jackson is employed,
everything will be right with sir thomas. don't imagine that nobody in
this house can see or judge but yourself. don't act yourself, if you do
not like it, but don't expect to govern everybody else."

"no, as to acting myself," said edmund, "_that_ i absolutely protest
against."

tom walked out of the room as he said it, and edmund was left to sit
down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.

fanny, who had heard it all, and borne edmund company in every feeling
throughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest
some comfort, "perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit
them. your brother's taste and your sisters' seem very different."

"i have no hope there, fanny. if they persist in the scheme, they will
find something. i shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_,
and that is all i can do."

"i should think my aunt norris would be on your side."

"i dare say she would, but she has no influence with either tom or my
sisters that could be of any use; and if i cannot convince them myself,
i shall let things take their course, without attempting it through
her. family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do
anything than be altogether by the ears."

his sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning,
were quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to his
representation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as tom.
their mother had no objection to the plan, and they were not in the
least afraid of their father's disapprobation. there could be no harm in
what had been done in so many respectable families, and by so many women
of the first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness run mad that
could see anything to censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only
brothers and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never be
heard of beyond themselves. julia _did_ seem inclined to admit that
maria's situation might require particular caution and delicacy--but
that could not extend to _her_--she was at liberty; and maria evidently
considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above
restraint, and leaving her less occasion than julia to consult either
father or mother. edmund had little to hope, but he was still urging the
subject when henry crawford entered the room, fresh from the parsonage,
calling out, "no want of hands in our theatre, miss bertram. no want
of understrappers: my sister desires her love, and hopes to be admitted
into the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna
or tame confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves."

maria gave edmund a glance, which meant, "what say you now? can we
be wrong if mary crawford feels the same?" and edmund, silenced,
was obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry
fascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to
dwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on
anything else.

the scheme advanced. opposition was vain; and as to mrs. norris, he
was mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any. she started no
difficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest
nephew and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the whole
arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at all
to herself, as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle,
and importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself
obliged to leave her own house, where she had been living a month at
her own cost, and take up her abode in theirs, that every hour might be
spent in their service, she was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with the
project.



chapter xiv

fanny seemed nearer being right than edmund had supposed. the business
of finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; and
the carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements, had
suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having made
the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident, was
already at work, while a play was still to seek. other preparations
were also in hand. an enormous roll of green baize had arrived from
northampton, and been cut out by mrs. norris (with a saving by her good
management of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming
into a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and
as two or three days passed away in this manner, edmund began almost to
hope that none might ever be found.

there were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people
to be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a
need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there
did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and
zeal could hold out.

on the tragic side were the miss bertrams, henry crawford, and mr.
yates; on the comic, tom bertram, not _quite_ alone, because it was
evident that mary crawford's wishes, though politely kept back, inclined
the same way: but his determinateness and his power seemed to make
allies unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilable
difference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the
whole, but every character first-rate, and three principal women. all
the best plays were run over in vain. neither hamlet, nor macbeth, nor
othello, nor douglas, nor the gamester, presented anything that could
satisfy even the tragedians; and the rivals, the school for scandal,
wheel of fortune, heir at law, and a long et cetera, were successively
dismissed with yet warmer objections. no piece could be proposed that
did not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the other
it was a continual repetition of, "oh no, _that_ will never do! let us
have no ranting tragedies. too many characters. not a tolerable
woman's part in the play. anything but _that_, my dear tom. it would be
impossible to fill it up. one could not expect anybody to take such a
part. nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end. _that_ might do,
perhaps, but for the low parts. if i _must_ give my opinion, i have
always thought it the most insipid play in the english language. _i_ do
not wish to make objections; i shall be happy to be of any use, but i
think we could not chuse worse."

fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness
which, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering
how it would end. for her own gratification she could have wished that
something might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play, but
everything of higher consequence was against it.

"this will never do," said tom bertram at last. "we are wasting time
most abominably. something must be fixed on. no matter what, so that
something is chosen. we must not be so nice. a few characters too many
must not frighten us. we must _double_ them. we must descend a little.
if a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of
it. from this moment i make no difficulties. i take any part you chuse
to give me, so as it be comic. let it but be comic, i condition for
nothing more."

for about the fifth time he then proposed the heir at law, doubting only
whether to prefer lord duberley or dr. pangloss for himself; and very
earnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others that
there were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.

the pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same
speaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the
table, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed--"lovers' vows! and why
should not lovers' vows do for _us_ as well as for the ravenshaws? how
came it never to be thought of before? it strikes me as if it would do
exactly. what say you all? here are two capital tragic parts for yates
and crawford, and here is the rhyming butler for me, if nobody else
wants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing i should not dislike,
and, as i said before, i am determined to take anything and do my best.
and as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. it is only count
cassel and anhalt."

the suggestion was generally welcome. everybody was growing weary of
indecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had been
proposed before so likely to suit them all. mr. yates was particularly
pleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the baron at ecclesford,
had grudged every rant of lord ravenshaw's, and been forced to re-rant
it all in his own room. the storm through baron wildenheim was the
height of his theatrical ambition; and with the advantage of knowing
half the scenes by heart already, he did now, with the greatest
alacrity, offer his services for the part. to do him justice, however,
he did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering that there was
some very good ranting-ground in frederick, he professed an equal
willingness for that. henry crawford was ready to take either. whichever
mr. yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a short parley
of compliment ensued. miss bertram, feeling all the interest of an
agatha in the question, took on her to decide it, by observing to mr.
yates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to
be considered, and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit him
peculiarly for the baron. she was acknowledged to be quite right, and
the two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the proper
frederick. three of the characters were now cast, besides mr. rushworth,
who was always answered for by maria as willing to do anything; when
julia, meaning, like her sister, to be agatha, began to be scrupulous on
miss crawford's account.

"this is not behaving well by the absent," said she. "here are not women
enough. amelia and agatha may do for maria and me, but here is nothing
for your sister, mr. crawford."

mr. crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he was very sure
his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that
she would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. but
this was immediately opposed by tom bertram, who asserted the part of
amelia to be in every respect the property of miss crawford, if she
would accept it. "it falls as naturally, as necessarily to her,"
said he, "as agatha does to one or other of my sisters. it can be no
sacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic."

a short silence followed. each sister looked anxious; for each felt the
best claim to agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the
rest. henry crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with
seeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the
business.

"i must entreat miss _julia_ bertram," said he, "not to engage in the
part of agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. you must
not, indeed you must not" (turning to her). "i could not stand your
countenance dressed up in woe and paleness. the many laughs we have had
together would infallibly come across me, and frederick and his knapsack
would be obliged to run away."

pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the
matter to julia's feelings. she saw a glance at maria which confirmed
the injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted, maria
was preferred; the smile of triumph which maria was trying to suppress
shewed how well it was understood; and before julia could command
herself enough to speak, her brother gave his weight against her too,
by saying, "oh yes! maria must be agatha. maria will be the best agatha.
though julia fancies she prefers tragedy, i would not trust her in it.
there is nothing of tragedy about her. she has not the look of it. her
features are not tragic features, and she walks too quick, and speaks
too quick, and would not keep her countenance. she had better do the old
countrywoman: the cottager's wife; you had, indeed, julia. cottager's
wife is a very pretty part, i assure you. the old lady relieves the
high-flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit. you
shall be cottager's wife."

"cottager's wife!" cried mr. yates. "what are you talking of? the most
trivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a
tolerable speech in the whole. your sister do that! it is an insult
to propose it. at ecclesford the governess was to have done it. we
all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else. a little more
justice, mr. manager, if you please. you do not deserve the office, if
you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better."

"why, as to _that_, my good friend, till i and my company have really
acted there must be some guesswork; but i mean no disparagement to
julia. we cannot have two agathas, and we must have one cottager's
wife; and i am sure i set her the example of moderation myself in being
satisfied with the old butler. if the part is trifling she will have
more credit in making something of it; and if she is so desperately bent
against everything humorous, let her take cottager's speeches instead of
cottager's wife's, and so change the parts all through; _he_ is solemn
and pathetic enough, i am sure. it could make no difference in the play,
and as for cottager himself, when he has got his wife's speeches, _i_
would undertake him with all my heart."

"with all your partiality for cottager's wife," said henry crawford, "it
will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and we
must not suffer her good-nature to be imposed on. we must not _allow_
her to accept the part. she must not be left to her own complaisance.
her talents will be wanted in amelia. amelia is a character more
difficult to be well represented than even agatha. i consider amelia
is the most difficult character in the whole piece. it requires great
powers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity without
extravagance. i have seen good actresses fail in the part. simplicity,
indeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession.
it requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not. it requires a
gentlewoman--a julia bertram. you _will_ undertake it, i hope?" turning
to her with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened her a little; but
while she hesitated what to say, her brother again interposed with miss
crawford's better claim.

"no, no, julia must not be amelia. it is not at all the part for her.
she would not like it. she would not do well. she is too tall and
robust. amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. it is
fit for miss crawford, and miss crawford only. she looks the part, and i
am persuaded will do it admirably."

without attending to this, henry crawford continued his supplication.
"you must oblige us," said he, "indeed you must. when you have studied
the character, i am sure you will feel it suit you. tragedy may be your
choice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_. you
will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will
not refuse to visit me in prison? i think i see you coming in with your
basket."

the influence of his voice was felt. julia wavered; but was he only
trying to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the previous
affront? she distrusted him. the slight had been most determined. he
was, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her. she looked suspiciously
at her sister; maria's countenance was to decide it: if she were vexed
and alarmed--but maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and julia
well knew that on this ground maria could not be happy but at her
expense. with hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she
said to him, "you do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance
when i come in with a basket of provisions--though one might have
supposed--but it is only as agatha that i was to be so overpowering!"
she stopped--henry crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he did not
know what to say. tom bertram began again--

"miss crawford must be amelia. she will be an excellent amelia."

"do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character," cried julia, with
angry quickness: "i am _not_ to be agatha, and i am sure i will do
nothing else; and as to amelia, it is of all parts in the world the
most disgusting to me. i quite detest her. an odious, little, pert,
unnatural, impudent girl. i have always protested against comedy, and
this is comedy in its worst form." and so saying, she walked hastily
out of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but exciting
small compassion in any except fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of
the whole, and who could not think of her as under the agitations of
_jealousy_ without great pity.

a short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother soon
returned to business and lovers' vows, and was eagerly looking over
the play, with mr. yates's help, to ascertain what scenery would be
necessary--while maria and henry crawford conversed together in an
under-voice, and the declaration with which she began of, "i am sure i
would give up the part to julia most willingly, but that though i shall
probably do it very ill, i feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse," was
doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.

when this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed
by tom bertram and mr. yates walking off together to consult farther in
the room now beginning to be called _the_ _theatre_, and miss bertram's
resolving to go down to the parsonage herself with the offer of amelia
to miss crawford; and fanny remained alone.

the first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which
had been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the play
of which she had heard so much. her curiosity was all awake, and she ran
through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals of
astonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that it
could be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! agatha and amelia
appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home
representation--the situation of one, and the language of the other,
so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could hardly
suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in; and
longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which
edmund would certainly make.



chapter xv

miss crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after miss
bertram's return from the parsonage, mr. rushworth arrived, and another
character was consequently cast. he had the offer of count cassel
and anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted miss
bertram to direct him; but upon being made to understand the different
style of the characters, and which was which, and recollecting that he
had once seen the play in london, and had thought anhalt a very stupid
fellow, he soon decided for the count. miss bertram approved the
decision, for the less he had to learn the better; and though she could
not sympathise in his wish that the count and agatha might be to act
together, nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the
leaves with the hope of still discovering such a scene, she very kindly
took his part in hand, and curtailed every speech that admitted being
shortened; besides pointing out the necessity of his being very much
dressed, and chusing his colours. mr. rushworth liked the idea of his
finery very well, though affecting to despise it; and was too much
engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others,
or draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of that displeasure which
maria had been half prepared for.

thus much was settled before edmund, who had been out all the morning,
knew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room before
dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between tom, maria, and mr.
yates; and mr. rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him
the agreeable news.

"we have got a play," said he. "it is to be lovers' vows; and i am to be
count cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin
cloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a
shooting-dress. i do not know how i shall like it."

fanny's eyes followed edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heard
this speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.

"lovers' vows!" in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his only reply
to mr. rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if
hardly doubting a contradiction.

"yes," cried mr. yates. "after all our debatings and difficulties, we
find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing so
unexceptionable, as lovers' vows. the wonder is that it should not have
been thought of before. my stupidity was abominable, for here we have
all the advantage of what i saw at ecclesford; and it is so useful to
have anything of a model! we have cast almost every part."

"but what do you do for women?" said edmund gravely, and looking at
maria.

maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, "i take the part
which lady ravenshaw was to have done, and" (with a bolder eye) "miss
crawford is to be amelia."

"i should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled
up, with _us_," replied edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat
his mother, aunt, and fanny, and seating himself with a look of great
vexation.

mr. rushworth followed him to say, "i come in three times, and have
two-and-forty speeches. that's something, is not it? but i do not much
like the idea of being so fine. i shall hardly know myself in a blue
dress and a pink satin cloak."

edmund could not answer him. in a few minutes mr. bertram was called
out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being
accompanied by mr. yates, and followed soon afterwards by mr. rushworth,
edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, "i cannot,
before mr. yates, speak what i feel as to this play, without reflecting
on his friends at ecclesford; but i must now, my dear maria, tell _you_,
that i think it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that i
hope you will give it up. i cannot but suppose you _will_ when you have
read it carefully over. read only the first act aloud to either your
mother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. it will not be necessary
to send you to your _father's_ judgment, i am convinced."

"we see things very differently," cried maria. "i am perfectly
acquainted with the play, i assure you; and with a very few omissions,
and so forth, which will be made, of course, i can see nothing
objectionable in it; and _i_ am not the _only_ young woman you find who
thinks it very fit for private representation."

"i am sorry for it," was his answer; "but in this matter it is _you_ who
are to lead. _you_ must set the example. if others have blundered, it
is your place to put them right, and shew them what true delicacy is.
in all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of the
party."

this picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved better
to lead than maria; and with far more good-humour she answered, "i am
much obliged to you, edmund; you mean very well, i am sure: but i still
think you see things too strongly; and i really cannot undertake to
harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. _there_ would be the
greatest indecorum, i think."

"do you imagine that i could have such an idea in my head? no; let your
conduct be the only harangue. say that, on examining the part, you feel
yourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and
confidence than you can be supposed to have. say this with firmness, and
it will be quite enough. all who can distinguish will understand your
motive. the play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as it
ought."

"do not act anything improper, my dear," said lady bertram. "sir thomas
would not like it.--fanny, ring the bell; i must have my dinner.--to be
sure, julia is dressed by this time."

"i am convinced, madam," said edmund, preventing fanny, "that sir thomas
would not like it."

"there, my dear, do you hear what edmund says?"

"if i were to decline the part," said maria, with renewed zeal, "julia
would certainly take it."

"what!" cried edmund, "if she knew your reasons!"

"oh! she might think the difference between us--the difference in our
situations--that _she_ need not be so scrupulous as _i_ might feel
necessary. i am sure she would argue so. no; you must excuse me; i
cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be so
disappointed, tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we
shall never act anything."

"i was just going to say the very same thing," said mrs. norris.
"if every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the
preparations will be all so much money thrown away, and i am sure _that_
would be a discredit to us all. i do not know the play; but, as maria
says, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most of
them) it can be easily left out. we must not be over-precise, edmund. as
mr. rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. i only wish tom had
known his own mind when the carpenters began, for there was the loss
of half a day's work about those side-doors. the curtain will be a good
job, however. the maids do their work very well, and i think we shall be
able to send back some dozens of the rings. there is no occasion to put
them so very close together. i _am_ of some use, i hope, in preventing
waste and making the most of things. there should always be one
steady head to superintend so many young ones. i forgot to tell tom of
something that happened to me this very day. i had been looking about me
in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who should i see but
dick jackson making up to the servants' hall-door with two bits of deal
board in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be sure; mother had
chanced to send him of a message to father, and then father had bid
him bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no how do without
them. i knew what all this meant, for the servants' dinner-bell
was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as i hate such
encroaching people (the jacksons are very encroaching, i have always
said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), i said to the boy
directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know, who ought
to be ashamed of himself), '_i'll_ take the boards to your father, dick,
so get you home again as fast as you can.' the boy looked very silly,
and turned away without offering a word, for i believe i might speak
pretty sharp; and i dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about
the house for one while. i hate such greediness--so good as your father
is to the family, employing the man all the year round!"

nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and
edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only
satisfaction.

dinner passed heavily. mrs. norris related again her triumph over dick
jackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked
of, for edmund's disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though
he would not have owned it. maria, wanting henry crawford's animating
support, thought the subject better avoided. mr. yates, who was trying
to make himself agreeable to julia, found her gloom less impenetrable on
any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company;
and mr. rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress in his
head, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.

but the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:
there was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening
giving fresh courage, tom, maria, and mr. yates, soon after their being
reassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a
separate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting
deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the
entrance of mr. and miss crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it
was, could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful
joy.

"well, how do you go on?" and "what have you settled?" and "oh! we
can do nothing without you," followed the first salutations; and henry
crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his
sister made her way to lady bertram, and with pleasant attention was
complimenting _her_. "i must really congratulate your ladyship," said
she, "on the play being chosen; for though you have borne it with
exemplary patience, i am sure you must be sick of all our noise and
difficulties. the actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be
infinitely more thankful for a decision; and i do sincerely give you
joy, madam, as well as mrs. norris, and everybody else who is in the
same predicament," glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond fanny to
edmund.

she was very civilly answered by lady bertram, but edmund said nothing.
his being only a bystander was not disclaimed. after continuing in chat
with the party round the fire a few minutes, miss crawford returned
to the party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to
interest herself in their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden
recollection, she exclaimed, "my good friends, you are most composedly
at work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let
me know my fate in the meanwhile. who is to be anhalt? what gentleman
among you am i to have the pleasure of making love to?"

for a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the same
melancholy truth, that they had not yet got any anhalt. "mr. rushworth
was to be count cassel, but no one had yet undertaken anhalt."

"i had my choice of the parts," said mr. rushworth; "but i thought i
should like the count best, though i do not much relish the finery i am
to have."

"you chose very wisely, i am sure," replied miss crawford, with a
brightened look; "anhalt is a heavy part."

"_the_ _count_ has two-and-forty speeches," returned mr. rushworth,
"which is no trifle."

"i am not at all surprised," said miss crawford, after a short pause,
"at this want of an anhalt. amelia deserves no better. such a forward
young lady may well frighten the men."

"i should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible,"
cried tom; "but, unluckily, the butler and anhalt are in together. i
will not entirely give it up, however; i will try what can be done--i
will look it over again."

"your _brother_ should take the part," said mr. yates, in a low voice.
"do not you think he would?"

"_i_ shall not ask him," replied tom, in a cold, determined manner.

miss crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards rejoined the
party at the fire.

"they do not want me at all," said she, seating herself. "i only puzzle
them, and oblige them to make civil speeches. mr. edmund bertram, as
you do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and,
therefore, i apply to _you_. what shall we do for an anhalt? is it
practicable for any of the others to double it? what is your advice?"

"my advice," said he calmly, "is that you change the play."

"_i_ should have no objection," she replied; "for though i should not
particularly dislike the part of amelia if well supported, that is, if
everything went well, i shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but
as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_" (looking
round), "it certainly will not be taken."

edmund said no more.

"if _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, i suppose it would be anhalt,"
observed the lady archly, after a short pause; "for he is a clergyman,
you know."

"_that_ circumstance would by no means tempt me," he replied, "for i
should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting. it
must be very difficult to keep anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn
lecturer; and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one
of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage."

miss crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment and
mortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the tea-table, and
gave all her attention to mrs. norris, who was presiding there.

"fanny," cried tom bertram, from the other table, where the conference
was eagerly carrying on, and the conversation incessant, "we want your
services."

fanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the habit of
employing her in that way was not yet overcome, in spite of all that
edmund could do.

"oh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat. we do not want your
_present_ services. we shall only want you in our play. you must be
cottager's wife."

"me!" cried fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look.
"indeed you must excuse me. i could not act anything if you were to give
me the world. no, indeed, i cannot act."

"indeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you. it need not frighten
you: it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozen
speeches altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word
you say; so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have you
to look at."

"if you are afraid of half a dozen speeches," cried mr. rushworth, "what
would you do with such a part as mine? i have forty-two to learn."

"it is not that i am afraid of learning by heart," said fanny, shocked
to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to feel
that almost every eye was upon her; "but i really cannot act."

"yes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_. learn your part, and we
will teach you all the rest. you have only two scenes, and as i shall
be cottager, i'll put you in and push you about, and you will do it very
well, i'll answer for it."

"no, indeed, mr. bertram, you must excuse me. you cannot have an idea.
it would be absolutely impossible for me. if i were to undertake it, i
should only disappoint you."

"phoo! phoo! do not be so shamefaced. you'll do it very well. every
allowance will be made for you. we do not expect perfection. you must
get a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make
you a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your
eyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman."

"you must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me," cried fanny, growing
more and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfully
at edmund, who was kindly observing her; but unwilling to exasperate
his brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile. her
entreaty had no effect on tom: he only said again what he had said
before; and it was not merely tom, for the requisition was now backed by
maria, and mr. crawford, and mr. yates, with an urgency which differed
from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and which
altogether was quite overpowering to fanny; and before she could breathe
after it, mrs. norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a
whisper at once angry and audible--"what a piece of work here is about
nothing: i am quite ashamed of you, fanny, to make such a difficulty of
obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort--so kind as they are to
you! take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no more of the
matter, i entreat."

"do not urge her, madam," said edmund. "it is not fair to urge her
in this manner. you see she does not like to act. let her chuse for
herself, as well as the rest of us. her judgment may be quite as safely
trusted. do not urge her any more."

"i am not going to urge her," replied mrs. norris sharply; "but i shall
think her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what her
aunt and cousins wish her--very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and
what she is."

edmund was too angry to speak; but miss crawford, looking for a moment
with astonished eyes at mrs. norris, and then at fanny, whose tears were
beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, "i
do not like my situation: this _place_ is too hot for me," and moved
away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to fanny, saying
to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself, "never mind,
my dear miss price, this is a cross evening: everybody is cross and
teasing, but do not let us mind them"; and with pointed attention
continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits, in spite of
being out of spirits herself. by a look at her brother she prevented any
farther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelings
by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to
all the little she had lost in edmund's favour.

fanny did not love miss crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her
for her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work,
and wishing _she_ could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and
supposing fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course she
would come out when her cousin was married, miss crawford proceeded to
inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said that
she had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine young
man, and advised fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea
again--she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery, or
help listening, and answering with more animation than she had intended.

the consultation upon the play still went on, and miss crawford's
attention was first called from fanny by tom bertram's telling her,
with infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to
undertake the part of anhalt in addition to the butler: he had been most
anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not do;
he must give it up. "but there will not be the smallest difficulty in
filling it," he added. "we have but to speak the word; we may pick and
chuse. i could name, at this moment, at least six young men within six
miles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company, and there are
one or two that would not disgrace us: i should not be afraid to trust
either of the olivers or charles maddox. tom oliver is a very clever
fellow, and charles maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see
anywhere, so i will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride over
to stoke, and settle with one of them."

while he spoke, maria was looking apprehensively round at edmund in full
expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this:
so contrary to all their first protestations; but edmund said nothing.
after a moment's thought, miss crawford calmly replied, "as far as i
am concerned, i can have no objection to anything that you all think
eligible. have i ever seen either of the gentlemen? yes, mr. charles
maddox dined at my sister's one day, did not he, henry? a quiet-looking
young man. i remember him. let _him_ be applied to, if you please, for
it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger."

charles maddox was to be the man. tom repeated his resolution of going
to him early on the morrow; and though julia, who had scarcely opened
her lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance
first at maria and then at edmund, that "the mansfield theatricals would
enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly," edmund still held his
peace, and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.

"i am not very sanguine as to our play," said miss crawford, in an
undervoice to fanny, after some consideration; "and i can tell mr.
maddox that i shall shorten some of _his_ speeches, and a great many of
_my_ _own_, before we rehearse together. it will be very disagreeable,
and by no means what i expected."



chapter xvi

it was not in miss crawford's power to talk fanny into any real
forgetfulness of what had passed. when the evening was over, she went to
bed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack
from her cousin tom, so public and so persevered in, and her spirits
sinking under her aunt's unkind reflection and reproach. to be called
into notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the prelude to
something so infinitely worse, to be told that she must do what was
so impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and
ingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence
of her situation, had been too distressing at the time to make the
remembrance when she was alone much less so, especially with the
superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation of the
subject. miss crawford had protected her only for the time; and if
she were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative
urgency that tom and maria were capable of, and edmund perhaps away,
what should she do? she fell asleep before she could answer the
question, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the next
morning. the little white attic, which had continued her sleeping-room
ever since her first entering the family, proving incompetent to suggest
any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she was dressed, to another
apartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and thinking,
and of which she had now for some time been almost equally mistress. it
had been their school-room; so called till the miss bertrams would not
allow it to be called so any longer, and inhabited as such to a later
period. there miss lee had lived, and there they had read and written,
and talked and laughed, till within the last three years, when she had
quitted them. the room had then become useless, and for some time was
quite deserted, except by fanny, when she visited her plants, or wanted
one of the books, which she was still glad to keep there, from the
deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above: but
gradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased, she had added
to her possessions, and spent more of her time there; and having nothing
to oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it,
that it was now generally admitted to be hers. the east room, as it had
been called ever since maria bertram was sixteen, was now considered
fanny's, almost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the
one making the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the miss
bertrams, with every superiority in their own apartments which their own
sense of superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and mrs.
norris, having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on fanny's
account, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody
else wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the
indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.

the aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable
in many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind
as fanny's; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be
driven from it entirely, even when winter came. the comfort of it in
her hours of leisure was extreme. she could go there after anything
unpleasant below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or
some train of thought at hand. her plants, her books--of which she had
been a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling--her
writing-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within
her reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would
do, she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an
interesting remembrance connected with it. everything was a friend, or
bore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much
of suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,
her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she
had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost
every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt
bertram had spoken for her, or miss lee had been encouraging, or, what
was yet more frequent or more dear, edmund had been her champion and her
friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had told
her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which made
her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, so
harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm. the
room was most dear to her, and she would not have changed its furniture
for the handsomest in the house, though what had been originally plain
had suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its greatest elegancies
and ornaments were a faded footstool of julia's work, too ill done
for the drawing-room, three transparencies, made in a rage for
transparencies, for the three lower panes of one window, where tintern
abbey held its station between a cave in italy and a moonlight lake in
cumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought unworthy of being
anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their side, and pinned
against the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the
mediterranean by william, with h.m.s. antwerp at the bottom, in letters
as tall as the mainmast.

to this nest of comforts fanny now walked down to try its influence on
an agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at edmund's profile
she could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums
she might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. but she had more
than fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feel
undecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she walked round the
room her doubts were increasing. was she _right_ in refusing what was
so warmly asked, so strongly wished for--what might be so essential to a
scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest complaisance
had set their hearts? was it not ill-nature, selfishness, and a fear of
exposing herself? and would edmund's judgment, would his persuasion of
sir thomas's disapprobation of the whole, be enough to justify her in a
determined denial in spite of all the rest? it would be so horrible to
her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her
own scruples; and as she looked around her, the claims of her cousins
to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon present
that she had received from them. the table between the windows was
covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which had been given her at
different times, principally by tom; and she grew bewildered as to the
amount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced. a tap at
the door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her
duty, and her gentle "come in" was answered by the appearance of one,
before whom all her doubts were wont to be laid. her eyes brightened at
the sight of edmund.

"can i speak with you, fanny, for a few minutes?" said he.

"yes, certainly."

"i want to consult. i want your opinion."

"my opinion!" she cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as it
gratified her.

"yes, your advice and opinion. i do not know what to do. this acting
scheme gets worse and worse, you see. they have chosen almost as bad a
play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask
the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. this is the
end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first.
i know no harm of charles maddox; but the excessive intimacy which
must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly
objectionable, the _more_ than intimacy--the familiarity. i cannot
think of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such
magnitude as must, _if_ _possible_, be prevented. do not you see it in
the same light?"

"yes; but what can be done? your brother is so determined."

"there is but _one_ thing to be done, fanny. i must take anhalt myself.
i am well aware that nothing else will quiet tom."

fanny could not answer him.

"it is not at all what i like," he continued. "no man can like being
driven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency. after being known to
oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face of
my joining them _now_, when they are exceeding their first plan in every
respect; but i can think of no other alternative. can you, fanny?"

"no," said fanny slowly, "not immediately, but--"

"but what? i see your judgment is not with me. think it a little over.
perhaps you are not so much aware as i am of the mischief that _may_, of
the unpleasantness that _must_ arise from a young man's being received
in this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at all hours,
and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints. to
think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create. it
is all very bad! put yourself in miss crawford's place, fanny. consider
what it would be to act amelia with a stranger. she has a right to be
felt for, because she evidently feels for herself. i heard enough of
what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be
acting with a stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part with
different expectations--perhaps without considering the subject enough
to know what was likely to be--it would be ungenerous, it would be
really wrong to expose her to it. her feelings ought to be respected.
does it not strike you so, fanny? you hesitate."

"i am sorry for miss crawford; but i am more sorry to see you drawn in
to do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think
will be disagreeable to my uncle. it will be such a triumph to the
others!"

"they will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously i
act. but, however, triumph there certainly will be, and i must brave it.
but if i can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business,
of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, i shall be
well repaid. as i am now, i have no influence, i can do nothing: i have
offended them, and they will not hear me; but when i have put them in
good-humour by this concession, i am not without hopes of persuading
them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than
they are now in the high road for. this will be a material gain. my
object is to confine it to mrs. rushworth and the grants. will not this
be worth gaining?"

"yes, it will be a great point."

"but still it has not your approbation. can you mention any other
measure by which i have a chance of doing equal good?"

"no, i cannot think of anything else."

"give me your approbation, then, fanny. i am not comfortable without
it."

"oh, cousin!"

"if you are against me, i ought to distrust myself, and yet--but it is
absolutely impossible to let tom go on in this way, riding about the
country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act--no matter whom:
the look of a gentleman is to be enough. i thought _you_ would have
entered more into miss crawford's feelings."

"no doubt she will be very glad. it must be a great relief to her," said
fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.

"she never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last
night. it gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill."

"she _was_ very kind, indeed, and i am glad to have her spared"...

she could not finish the generous effusion. her conscience stopt her in
the middle, but edmund was satisfied.

"i shall walk down immediately after breakfast," said he, "and am sure
of giving pleasure there. and now, dear fanny, i will not interrupt you
any longer. you want to be reading. but i could not be easy till i had
spoken to you, and come to a decision. sleeping or waking, my head has
been full of this matter all night. it is an evil, but i am certainly
making it less than it might be. if tom is up, i shall go to him
directly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all
in high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with
such unanimity. _you_, in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into
china, i suppose. how does lord macartney go on?"--opening a volume on
the table and then taking up some others. "and here are crabbe's tales,
and the idler, at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book. i
admire your little establishment exceedingly; and as soon as i am
gone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit
comfortably down to your table. but do not stay here to be cold."

he went; but there was no reading, no china, no composure for fanny. he
had told her the most extraordinary, the most inconceivable, the most
unwelcome news; and she could think of nothing else. to be acting! after
all his objections--objections so just and so public! after all that she
had heard him say, and seen him look, and known him to be feeling. could
it be possible? edmund so inconsistent! was he not deceiving himself?
was he not wrong? alas! it was all miss crawford's doing. she had seen
her influence in every speech, and was miserable. the doubts and alarms
as to her own conduct, which had previously distressed her, and
which had all slept while she listened to him, were become of little
consequence now. this deeper anxiety swallowed them up. things should
take their course; she cared not how it ended. her cousins might attack,
but could hardly tease her. she was beyond their reach; and if at last
obliged to yield--no matter--it was all misery now.



chapter xvii

it was, indeed, a triumphant day to mr. bertram and maria. such a
victory over edmund's discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was
most delightful. there was no longer anything to disturb them in their
darling project, and they congratulated each other in private on the
jealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee
of feelings gratified in every way. edmund might still look grave, and
say he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play
in particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven
to it by the force of selfish inclinations only. edmund had descended
from that moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they were
both as much the better as the happier for the descent.

they behaved very well, however, to _him_ on the occasion, betraying no
exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed
to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of charles
maddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him against their
inclination. "to have it quite in their own family circle was what
they had particularly wished. a stranger among them would have been the
destruction of all their comfort"; and when edmund, pursuing that idea,
gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were
ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. it was
all good-humour and encouragement. mrs. norris offered to contrive his
dress, mr. yates assured him that anhalt's last scene with the baron
admitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and mr. rushworth undertook
to count his speeches.

"perhaps," said tom, "fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now.
perhaps you may persuade _her_."

"no, she is quite determined. she certainly will not act."

"oh! very well." and not another word was said; but fanny felt herself
again in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to
fail her already.

there were not fewer smiles at the parsonage than at the park on this
change in edmund; miss crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered
