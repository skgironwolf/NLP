chapter
i
the
birth
of
the
prince
and
the
pauper
in
the
ancient
city
of
london
on
a
certain
autumn
day
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
boy
was
born
to
a
poor
family
of
the
name
of
canty
who
did
not
want
him
on
the
same
day
another
english
child
was
born
to
a
rich
family
of
the
name
of
tudor
who
did
want
him
all
england
wanted
him
too
england
had
so
longed
for
him
and
hoped
for
him
and
prayed
god
for
him
that
now
that
he
was
really
come
the
people
went
nearly
mad
for
joy
mere
acquaintances
hugged
and
kissed
each
other
and
cried
everybody
took
a
holiday
and
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
feasted
and
danced
and
sang
and
got
very
mellow
and
they
kept
this
up
for
days
and
nights
together
by
day
london
was
a
sight
to
see
with
gay
banners
waving
from
every
balcony
and
housetop
and
splendid
pageants
marching
along
by
night
it
was
again
a
sight
to
see
with
its
great
bonfires
at
every
corner
and
its
troops
of
revellers
making
merry
around
them
there
was
no
talk
in
all
england
but
of
the
new
baby
edward
tudor
prince
of
wales
who
lay
lapped
in
silks
and
satins
unconscious
of
all
this
fuss
and
not
knowing
that
great
lords
and
ladies
were
tending
him
and
watching
over
him
and
not
caring
either
but
there
was
no
talk
about
the
other
baby
tom
canty
lapped
in
his
poor
rags
except
among
the
family
of
paupers
whom
he
had
just
come
to
trouble
with
his
presence
chapter
ii
tom
s
early
life
let
us
skip
a
number
of
years
london
was
fifteen
hundred
years
old
and
was
a
great
town
for
that
day
it
had
a
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
some
think
double
as
many
the
streets
were
very
narrow
and
crooked
and
dirty
especially
in
the
part
where
tom
canty
lived
which
was
not
far
from
london
bridge
the
houses
were
of
wood
with
the
second
story
projecting
over
the
first
and
the
third
sticking
its
elbows
out
beyond
the
second
the
higher
the
houses
grew
the
broader
they
grew
they
were
skeletons
of
strong
criss
cross
beams
with
solid
material
between
coated
with
plaster
the
beams
were
painted
red
or
blue
or
black
according
to
the
owner
s
taste
and
this
gave
the
houses
a
very
picturesque
look
the
windows
were
small
glazed
with
little
diamond
shaped
panes
and
they
opened
outward
on
hinges
like
doors
the
house
which
tom
s
father
lived
in
was
up
a
foul
little
pocket
called
offal
court
out
of
pudding
lane
it
was
small
decayed
and
rickety
but
it
was
packed
full
of
wretchedly
poor
families
canty
s
tribe
occupied
a
room
on
the
third
floor
the
mother
and
father
had
a
sort
of
bedstead
in
the
corner
but
tom
his
grandmother
and
his
two
sisters
bet
and
nan
were
not
restricted
they
had
all
the
floor
to
themselves
and
might
sleep
where
they
chose
there
were
the
remains
of
a
blanket
or
two
and
some
bundles
of
ancient
and
dirty
straw
but
these
could
not
rightly
be
called
beds
for
they
were
not
organised
they
were
kicked
into
a
general
pile
mornings
and
selections
made
from
the
mass
at
night
for
service
bet
and
nan
were
fifteen
years
old
twins
they
were
good
hearted
girls
unclean
clothed
in
rags
and
profoundly
ignorant
their
mother
was
like
them
but
the
father
and
the
grandmother
were
a
couple
of
fiends
they
got
drunk
whenever
they
could
then
they
fought
each
other
or
anybody
else
who
came
in
the
way
they
cursed
and
swore
always
drunk
or
sober
john
canty
was
a
thief
and
his
mother
a
beggar
they
made
beggars
of
the
children
but
failed
to
make
thieves
of
them
among
but
not
of
the
dreadful
rabble
that
inhabited
the
house
was
a
good
old
priest
whom
the
king
had
turned
out
of
house
and
home
with
a
pension
of
a
few
farthings
and
he
used
to
get
the
children
aside
and
teach
them
right
ways
secretly
father
andrew
also
taught
tom
a
little
latin
and
how
to
read
and
write
and
would
have
done
the
same
with
the
girls
but
they
were
afraid
of
the
jeers
of
their
friends
who
could
not
have
endured
such
a
queer
accomplishment
in
them
all
offal
court
was
just
such
another
hive
as
canty
s
house
drunkenness
riot
and
brawling
were
the
order
there
every
night
and
nearly
all
night
long
broken
heads
were
as
common
as
hunger
in
that
place
yet
little
tom
was
not
unhappy
he
had
a
hard
time
of
it
but
did
not
know
it
it
was
the
sort
of
time
that
all
the
offal
court
boys
had
therefore
he
supposed
it
was
the
correct
and
comfortable
thing
when
he
came
home
empty
handed
at
night
he
knew
his
father
would
curse
him
and
thrash
him
first
and
that
when
he
was
done
the
awful
grandmother
would
do
it
all
over
again
and
improve
on
it
and
that
away
in
the
night
his
starving
mother
would
slip
to
him
stealthily
with
any
miserable
scrap
or
crust
she
had
been
able
to
save
for
him
by
going
hungry
herself
notwithstanding
she
was
often
caught
in
that
sort
of
treason
and
soundly
beaten
for
it
by
her
husband
no
tom
s
life
went
along
well
enough
especially
in
summer
he
only
begged
just
enough
to
save
himself
for
the
laws
against
mendicancy
were
stringent
and
the
penalties
heavy
so
he
put
in
a
good
deal
of
his
time
listening
to
good
father
andrew
s
charming
old
tales
and
legends
about
giants
and
fairies
dwarfs
and
genii
and
enchanted
castles
and
gorgeous
kings
and
princes
his
head
grew
to
be
full
of
these
wonderful
things
and
many
a
night
as
he
lay
in
the
dark
on
his
scant
and
offensive
straw
tired
hungry
and
smarting
from
a
thrashing
he
unleashed
his
imagination
and
soon
forgot
his
aches
and
pains
in
delicious
picturings
to
himself
of
the
charmed
life
of
a
petted
prince
in
a
regal
palace
one
desire
came
in
time
to
haunt
him
day
and
night
it
was
to
see
a
real
prince
with
his
own
eyes
he
spoke
of
it
once
to
some
of
his
offal
court
comrades
but
they
jeered
him
and
scoffed
him
so
unmercifully
that
he
was
glad
to
keep
his
dream
to
himself
after
that
he
often
read
the
priest
s
old
books
and
got
him
to
explain
and
enlarge
upon
them
his
dreamings
and
readings
worked
certain
changes
in
him
by
and
by
his
dream
people
were
so
fine
that
he
grew
to
lament
his
shabby
clothing
and
his
dirt
and
to
wish
to
be
clean
and
better
clad
he
went
on
playing
in
the
mud
just
the
same
and
enjoying
it
too
but
instead
of
splashing
around
in
the
thames
solely
for
the
fun
of
it
he
began
to
find
an
added
value
in
it
because
of
the
washings
and
cleansings
it
afforded
tom
could
always
find
something
going
on
around
the
maypole
in
cheapside
and
at
the
fairs
and
now
and
then
he
and
the
rest
of
london
had
a
chance
to
see
a
military
parade
when
some
famous
unfortunate
was
carried
prisoner
to
the
tower
by
land
or
boat
one
summer
s
day
he
saw
poor
anne
askew
and
three
men
burned
at
the
stake
in
smithfield
and
heard
an
ex
bishop
preach
a
sermon
to
them
which
did
not
interest
him
yes
tom
s
life
was
varied
and
pleasant
enough
on
the
whole
by
and
by
tom
s
reading
and
dreaming
about
princely
life
wrought
such
a
strong
effect
upon
him
that
he
began
to
act
the
prince
unconsciously
his
speech
and
manners
became
curiously
ceremonious
and
courtly
to
the
vast
admiration
and
amusement
of
his
intimates
but
tom
s
influence
among
these
young
people
began
to
grow
now
day
by
day
and
in
time
he
came
to
be
looked
up
to
by
them
with
a
sort
of
wondering
awe
as
a
superior
being
he
seemed
to
know
so
much
and
he
could
do
and
say
such
marvellous
things
and
withal
he
was
so
deep
and
wise
tom
s
remarks
and
tom
s
performances
were
reported
by
the
boys
to
their
elders
and
these
also
presently
began
to
discuss
tom
canty
and
to
regard
him
as
a
most
gifted
and
extraordinary
creature
full
grown
people
brought
their
perplexities
to
tom
for
solution
and
were
often
astonished
at
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
his
decisions
in
fact
he
was
become
a
hero
to
all
who
knew
him
except
his
own
family
these
only
saw
nothing
in
him
privately
after
a
while
tom
organised
a
royal
court
he
was
the
prince
his
special
comrades
were
guards
chamberlains
equerries
lords
and
ladies
in
waiting
and
the
royal
family
daily
the
mock
prince
was
received
with
elaborate
ceremonials
borrowed
by
tom
from
his
romantic
readings
daily
the
great
affairs
of
the
mimic
kingdom
were
discussed
in
the
royal
council
and
daily
his
mimic
highness
issued
decrees
to
his
imaginary
armies
navies
and
viceroyalties
after
which
he
would
go
forth
in
his
rags
and
beg
a
few
farthings
eat
his
poor
crust
take
his
customary
cuffs
and
abuse
and
then
stretch
himself
upon
his
handful
of
foul
straw
and
resume
his
empty
grandeurs
in
his
dreams
and
still
his
desire
to
look
just
once
upon
a
real
prince
in
the
flesh
grew
upon
him
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
until
at
last
it
absorbed
all
other
desires
and
became
the
one
passion
of
his
life
one
january
day
on
his
usual
begging
tour
he
tramped
despondently
up
and
down
the
region
round
about
mincing
lane
and
little
east
cheap
hour
after
hour
bare
footed
and
cold
looking
in
at
cook
shop
windows
and
longing
for
the
dreadful
pork
pies
and
other
deadly
inventions
displayed
there
for
to
him
these
were
dainties
fit
for
the
angels
that
is
judging
by
the
smell
they
were
for
it
had
never
been
his
good
luck
to
own
and
eat
one
there
was
a
cold
drizzle
of
rain
the
atmosphere
was
murky
it
was
a
melancholy
day
at
night
tom
reached
home
so
wet
and
tired
and
hungry
that
it
was
not
possible
for
his
father
and
grandmother
to
observe
his
forlorn
condition
and
not
be
moved
after
their
fashion
wherefore
they
gave
him
a
brisk
cuffing
at
once
and
sent
him
to
bed
for
a
long
time
his
pain
and
hunger
and
the
swearing
and
fighting
going
on
in
the
building
kept
him
awake
but
at
last
his
thoughts
drifted
away
to
far
romantic
lands
and
he
fell
asleep
in
the
company
of
jewelled
and
gilded
princelings
who
live
in
vast
palaces
and
had
servants
salaaming
before
them
or
flying
to
execute
their
orders
and
then
as
usual
he
dreamed
that
he
was
a
princeling
himself
all
night
long
the
glories
of
his
royal
estate
shone
upon
him
he
moved
among
great
lords
and
ladies
in
a
blaze
of
light
breathing
perfumes
drinking
in
delicious
music
and
answering
the
reverent
obeisances
of
the
glittering
throng
as
it
parted
to
make
way
for
him
with
here
a
smile
and
there
a
nod
of
his
princely
head
and
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
and
looked
upon
the
wretchedness
about
him
his
dream
had
had
its
usual
effect
it
had
intensified
the
sordidness
of
his
surroundings
a
thousandfold
then
came
bitterness
and
heart
break
and
tears
chapter
iii
tom
s
meeting
with
the
prince
tom
got
up
hungry
and
sauntered
hungry
away
but
with
his
thoughts
busy
with
the
shadowy
splendours
of
his
night
s
dreams
he
wandered
here
and
there
in
the
city
hardly
noticing
where
he
was
going
or
what
was
happening
around
him
people
jostled
him
and
some
gave
him
rough
speech
but
it
was
all
lost
on
the
musing
boy
by
and
by
he
found
himself
at
temple
bar
the
farthest
from
home
he
had
ever
travelled
in
that
direction
he
stopped
and
considered
a
moment
then
fell
into
his
imaginings
again
and
passed
on
outside
the
walls
of
london
the
strand
had
ceased
to
be
a
country
road
then
and
regarded
itself
as
a
street
but
by
a
strained
construction
for
though
there
was
a
tolerably
compact
row
of
houses
on
one
side
of
it
there
were
only
some
scattered
great
buildings
on
the
other
these
being
palaces
of
rich
nobles
with
ample
and
beautiful
grounds
stretching
to
the
river
grounds
that
are
now
closely
packed
with
grim
acres
of
brick
and
stone
tom
discovered
charing
village
presently
and
rested
himself
at
the
beautiful
cross
built
there
by
a
bereaved
king
of
earlier
days
then
idled
down
a
quiet
lovely
road
past
the
great
cardinal
s
stately
palace
toward
a
far
more
mighty
and
majestic
palace
beyond
westminster
tom
stared
in
glad
wonder
at
the
vast
pile
of
masonry
the
wide
spreading
wings
the
frowning
bastions
and
turrets
the
huge
stone
gateway
with
its
gilded
bars
and
its
magnificent
array
of
colossal
granite
lions
and
other
the
signs
and
symbols
of
english
royalty
was
the
desire
of
his
soul
to
be
satisfied
at
last
here
indeed
was
a
king
s
palace
might
he
not
hope
to
see
a
prince
now
a
prince
of
flesh
and
blood
if
heaven
were
willing
at
each
side
of
the
gilded
gate
stood
a
living
statue
that
is
to
say
an
erect
and
stately
and
motionless
man
at
arms
clad
from
head
to
heel
in
shining
steel
armour
at
a
respectful
distance
were
many
country
folk
and
people
from
the
city
waiting
for
any
chance
glimpse
of
royalty
that
might
offer
splendid
carriages
with
splendid
people
in
them
and
splendid
servants
outside
were
arriving
and
departing
by
several
other
noble
gateways
that
pierced
the
royal
enclosure
poor
little
tom
in
his
rags
approached
and
was
moving
slowly
and
timidly
past
the
sentinels
with
a
beating
heart
and
a
rising
hope
when
all
at
once
he
caught
sight
through
the
golden
bars
of
a
spectacle
that
almost
made
him
shout
for
joy
within
was
a
comely
boy
tanned
and
brown
with
sturdy
outdoor
sports
and
exercises
whose
clothing
was
all
of
lovely
silks
and
satins
shining
with
jewels
at
his
hip
a
little
jewelled
sword
and
dagger
dainty
buskins
on
his
feet
with
red
heels
and
on
his
head
a
jaunty
crimson
cap
with
drooping
plumes
fastened
with
a
great
sparkling
gem
several
gorgeous
gentlemen
stood
near
his
servants
without
a
doubt
oh
he
was
a
prince
a
prince
a
living
prince
a
real
prince
without
the
shadow
of
a
question
and
the
prayer
of
the
pauper
boy
s
heart
was
answered
at
last
tom
s
breath
came
quick
and
short
with
excitement
and
his
eyes
grew
big
with
wonder
and
delight
everything
gave
way
in
his
mind
instantly
to
one
desire
that
was
to
get
close
to
the
prince
and
have
a
good
devouring
look
at
him
before
he
knew
what
he
was
about
he
had
his
face
against
the
gate
bars
the
next
instant
one
of
the
soldiers
snatched
him
rudely
away
and
sent
him
spinning
among
the
gaping
crowd
of
country
gawks
and
london
idlers
the
soldier
said
mind
thy
manners
thou
young
beggar
the
crowd
jeered
and
laughed
but
the
young
prince
sprang
to
the
gate
with
his
face
flushed
and
his
eyes
flashing
with
indignation
and
cried
out
how
dar
st
thou
use
a
poor
lad
like
that
how
dar
st
thou
use
the
king
my
father
s
meanest
subject
so
open
the
gates
and
let
him
in
you
should
have
seen
that
fickle
crowd
snatch
off
their
hats
then
you
should
have
heard
them
cheer
and
shout
long
live
the
prince
of
wales
the
soldiers
presented
arms
with
their
halberds
opened
the
gates
and
presented
again
as
the
little
prince
of
poverty
passed
in
in
his
fluttering
rags
to
join
hands
with
the
prince
of
limitless
plenty
edward
tudor
said
thou
lookest
tired
and
hungry

st
been
treated
ill
come
with
me
half
a
dozen
attendants
sprang
forward
to
i
don
t
know
what
interfere
no
doubt
but
they
were
waved
aside
with
a
right
royal
gesture
and
they
stopped
stock
still
where
they
were
like
so
many
statues
edward
took
tom
to
a
rich
apartment
in
the
palace
which
he
called
his
cabinet
by
his
command
a
repast
was
brought
such
as
tom
had
never
encountered
before
except
in
books
the
prince
with
princely
delicacy
and
breeding
sent
away
the
servants
so
that
his
humble
guest
might
not
be
embarrassed
by
their
critical
presence
then
he
sat
near
by
and
asked
questions
while
tom
ate
what
is

name

maketh
it
up

a
fierce
look

into

eyes
and

cried

court
do
strive
against

on
in
summer
sir
we
wade
and
swim
in
the
canals
and
in
the
river
and
each
doth
duck
his
neighbour
and
splatter
him
with
water
and
dive
and
shout
and
tumble
and
twould
be
worth
my
father
s
kingdom
but
to
enjoy
it
once
prithee
go
on
we
dance
and
sing
about
the
maypole
in
cheapside
we
play
in
the
sand
each
covering
his
neighbour
up
and
times
we
make
mud
pastry
oh
the
lovely
mud

hath
not
its
like
for
delightfulness
in
all
the
world
we
do
fairly
wallow
in
the
mud
sir
saving
your
worship
s
presence
oh
prithee
say
no
more
tis
glorious
if
that
i
could
but
clothe
me
in
raiment
like
to
thine
and
strip
my
feet
and
revel
in
the
mud
once
just
once
with
none
to
rebuke
me
or
forbid
meseemeth
i
could
forego
the
crown
and
if
that
i
could
clothe
me
once
sweet
sir
as
thou
art
clad
just
once
oho
would
st
like
it
then
so
shall
it
be
doff
thy
rags
and
don
these
splendours
lad
it
is
a
brief
happiness
but
will
be
not
less
keen
for
that
we
will
have
it
while
we
may
and
change
again
before
any
come
to
molest
a
few
minutes
later
the
little
prince
of
wales
was
garlanded
with
tom
s
fluttering
odds
and
ends
and
the
little
prince
of
pauperdom
was
tricked
out
in
the
gaudy
plumage
of
royalty
the
two
went
and
stood
side
by
side
before
a
great
mirror
and
lo
a
miracle
there
did
not
seem
to
have
been
any
change
made
they
stared
at
each
other
then
at
the
glass
then
at
each
other
again
at
last
the
puzzled
princeling
said
what
dost
thou
make
of
this
ah
good
your
worship
require
me
not
to
answer
it
is
not
meet
that
one
of
my
degree
should
utter
the
thing
then
will
i
utter
it
thou
hast
the
same
hair
the
same
eyes
the
same
voice
and
manner
the
same
form
and
stature
the
same
face
and
countenance
that
i
bear
fared
we
forth
naked
there
is
none
could
say
which
was
you
and
which
the
prince
of
wales
and
now
that
i
am
clothed
as
thou
wert
clothed
it
seemeth
i
should
be
able
the
more
nearly
to
feel
as
thou
didst
when
the
brute
soldier
hark
ye
is
not
this
a
bruise
upon
your
hand
yes
but
it
is
a
slight
thing
and
your
worship
knoweth
that
the
poor
man
at
arms
peace
it
was
a
shameful
thing
and
a
cruel
cried
the
little
prince
stamping
his
bare
foot
if
the
king
stir
not
a
step
till
i
come
again
it
is
a
command
in
a
moment
he
had
snatched
up
and
put
away
an
article
of
national
importance
that
lay
upon
a
table
and
was
out
at
the
door
and
flying
through
the
palace
grounds
in
his
bannered
rags
with
a
hot
face
and
glowing
eyes
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
great
gate
he
seized
the
bars
and
tried
to
shake
them
shouting
open
unbar
the
gates
the
soldier
that
had
maltreated
tom
obeyed
promptly
and
as
the
prince
burst
through
the
portal
half
smothered
with
royal
wrath
the
soldier
fetched
him
a
sounding
box
on
the
ear
that
sent
him
whirling
to
the
roadway
and
said
take
that
thou
beggar
s
spawn
for
what
thou
got
st
me
from
his
highness
the
crowd
roared
with
laughter
the
prince
picked
himself
out
of
the
mud
and
made
fiercely
at
the
sentry
shouting
i
am
the
prince
of
wales
my
person
is
sacred
and
thou
shalt
hang
for
laying
thy
hand
upon
me
the
soldier
brought
his
halberd
to
a
present
arms
and
said
mockingly
i
salute
your
gracious
highness
then
angrily
be
off
thou
crazy
rubbish
here
the
jeering
crowd
closed
round
the
poor
little
prince
and
hustled
him
far
down
the
road
hooting
him
and
shouting
way
for
his
royal
highness
way
for
the
prince
of
wales
chapter
iv
the
prince
s
troubles
begin
after
hours
of
persistent
pursuit
and
persecution
the
little
prince
was
at
last
deserted
by
the
rabble
and
left
to
himself
as
long
as
he
had
been
able
to
rage
against
the
mob
and
threaten
it
royally
and
royally
utter
commands
that
were
good
stuff
to
laugh
at
he
was
very
entertaining
but
when
weariness
finally
forced
him
to
be
silent
he
was
no
longer
of
use
to
his
tormentors
and
they
sought
amusement
elsewhere
he
looked
about
him
now
but
could
not
recognise
the
locality
he
was
within
the
city
of
london
that
was
all
he
knew
he
moved
on
aimlessly
and
in
a
little
while
the
houses
thinned
and
the
passers
by
were
infrequent
he
bathed
his
bleeding
feet
in
the
brook
which
flowed
then
where
farringdon
street
now
is
rested
a
few
moments
then
passed
on
and
presently
came
upon
a
great
space
with
only
a
few
scattered
houses
in
it
and
a
prodigious
church
he
recognised
this
church
scaffoldings
were
about
everywhere
and
swarms
of
workmen
for
it
was
undergoing
elaborate
repairs
the
prince
took
heart
at
once
he
felt
that
his
troubles
were
at
an
end
now
he
said
to
himself
it
is
the
ancient
grey
friars
church
which
the
king
my
father
hath
taken
from
the
monks
and
given
for
a
home
for
ever
for
poor
and
forsaken
children
and
new
named
it
christ
s
church
right
gladly
will
they
serve
the
son
of
him
who
hath
done
so
generously
by
them
and
the
more
that
that
son
is
himself
as
poor
and
as
forlorn
as
any
that
be
sheltered
here
this
day
or
ever
shall
be
he
was
soon
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
boys
who
were
running
jumping
playing
at
ball
and
leap
frog
and
otherwise
disporting
themselves
and
right
noisily
too
they
were
all
dressed
alike
and
in
the
fashion
which
in
that
day
prevailed
among
serving
men
and
prentices
1
that
is
to
say
each
had
on
the
crown
of
his
head
a
flat
black
cap
about
the
size
of
a
saucer
which
was
not
useful
as
a
covering
it
being
of
such
scanty
dimensions
neither
was
it
ornamental
from
beneath
it
the
hair
fell
unparted
to
the
middle
of
the
forehead
and
was
cropped
straight
around
a
clerical
band
at
the
neck
a
blue
gown
that
fitted
closely
and
hung
as
low
as
the
knees
or
lower
full
sleeves
a
broad
red
belt
bright
yellow
stockings
gartered
above
the
knees
low
shoes
with
large
metal
buckles
it
was
a
sufficiently
ugly
costume
the
boys
stopped
their
play
and
flocked
about
the
prince
who
said
with
native
dignity
good
lads
say
to
your
master
that
edward
prince
of
wales
desireth
speech
with
him
a
great
shout
went
up
at
this
and
one
rude
fellow
said
marry
art
thou
his
grace
s
messenger
beggar
the
prince
s
face
flushed
with
anger
and
his
ready
hand
flew
to
his
hip
but
there
was
nothing
there
there
was
a
storm
of
laughter
and
one
boy
said
didst
mark
that
he
fancied
he
had
a
sword
belike
he
is
the
prince
himself
this
sally
brought
more
laughter
poor
edward
drew
himself
up
proudly
and
said
i
am
the
prince
and
it
ill
beseemeth
you
that
feed
upon
the
king
my
father
s
bounty
to
use
me
so
this
was
vastly
enjoyed
as
the
laughter
testified
the
youth
who
had
first
spoken
shouted
to
his
comrades
ho
swine
slaves
pensioners
of
his
grace
s
princely
father
where
be
your
manners
down
on
your
marrow
bones
all
of
ye
and
do
reverence
to
his
kingly
port
and
royal
rags
with
boisterous
mirth
they
dropped
upon
their
knees
in
a
body
and
did
mock
homage
to
their
prey
the
prince
spurned
the
nearest
boy
with
his
foot
and
said
fiercely
take
thou
that
till
the
morrow
come
and
i
build
thee
a
gibbet
ah
but
this
was
not
a
joke
this
was
going
beyond
fun
the
laughter
ceased
on
the
instant
and
fury
took
its
place
a
dozen
shouted
hale
him
forth
to
the
horse
pond
to
the
horse
pond
where
be
the
dogs
ho
there
lion
ho
fangs
then
followed
such
a
thing
as
england
had
never
seen
before
the
sacred
person
of
the
heir
to
the
throne
rudely
buffeted
by
plebeian
hands
and
set
upon
and
torn
by
dogs
as
night
drew
to
a
close
that
day
the
prince
found
himself
far
down
in
the
close
built
portion
of
the
city
his
body
was
bruised
his
hands
were
bleeding
and
his
rags
were
all
besmirched
with
mud
he
wandered
on
and
on
and
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
and
so
tired
and
faint
he
could
hardly
drag
one
foot
after
the
other
he
had
ceased
to
ask
questions
of
anyone
since
they
brought
him
only
insult
instead
of
information
he
kept
muttering
to
himself
offal
court
that
is
the
name
if
i
can
but
find
it
before
my
strength
is
wholly
spent
and
i
drop
then
am
i
saved
for
his
people
will
take
me
to
the
palace
and
prove
that
i
am
none
of
theirs
but
the
true
prince
and
i
shall
have
mine
own
again
and
now
and
then
his
mind
reverted
to
his
treatment
by
those
rude
christ
s
hospital
boys
and
he
said
when
i
am
king
they
shall
not
have
bread
and
shelter
only
but
also
teachings
out
of
books
for
a
full
belly
is
little
worth
where
the
mind
is
starved
and
the
heart
i
will
keep
this
diligently
in
my
remembrance
that
this
day
s
lesson
be
not
lost
upon
me
and
my
people
suffer
thereby
for
learning
softeneth
the
heart
and
breedeth
gentleness
and
charity
1
the
lights
began
to
twinkle
it
came
on
to
rain
the
wind
rose
and
a
raw
and
gusty
night
set
in
the
houseless
prince
the
homeless
heir
to
the
throne
of
england
still
moved
on
drifting
deeper
into
the
maze
of
squalid
alleys
where
the
swarming
hives
of
poverty
and
misery
were
massed
together
suddenly
a
great
drunken
ruffian
collared
him
and
said
out
to
this
time
of
night
again
and
hast
not
brought
a
farthing
home
i
warrant
me
if
it
be
so
an
i
do
not
break
all
the
bones
in
thy
lean
body
then
am
i
not
john
canty
but
some
other
the
prince
twisted
himself
loose
unconsciously
brushed
his
profaned
shoulder
and
eagerly
said
oh
art
his
father
truly
sweet
heaven
grant
it
be
so
then
wilt
thou
fetch
him
away
and
restore
me
his
father
i
know
not
what
thou
mean
st
i
but
know
i
am
thy
father
as
thou
shalt
soon
have
cause
to
oh
jest
not
palter
not
delay
not
i
am
worn
i
am
wounded
i
can
bear
no
more
take
me
to
the
king
my
father
and
he
will
make
thee
rich
beyond
thy
wildest
dreams
believe
me
man
believe
me
i
speak
no
lie
but
only
the
truth
put
forth
thy
hand
and
save
me
i
am
indeed
the
prince
of
wales
the
man
stared
down
stupefied
upon
the
lad
then
shook
his
head
and
muttered
gone
stark
mad
as
any
tom
o
bedlam
then
collared
him
once
more
and
said
with
a
coarse
laugh
and
an
oath
but
mad
or
no
mad
i
and
thy
gammer
canty
will
soon
find
where
the
soft
places
in
thy
bones
lie
or
i
m
no
true
man
with
this
he
dragged
the
frantic
and
struggling
prince
away
and
disappeared
up
a
front
court
followed
by
a
delighted
and
noisy
swarm
of
human
vermin
chapter
v
tom
as
a
patrician
tom
canty
left
alone
in
the
prince
s
cabinet
made
good
use
of
his
opportunity
he
turned
himself
this
way
and
that
before
the
great
mirror
admiring
his
finery
then
walked
away
imitating
the
prince
s
high
bred
carriage
and
still
observing
results
in
the
glass
next
he
drew
the
beautiful
sword
and
bowed
kissing
the
blade
and
laying
it
across
his
breast
as
he
had
seen
a
noble
knight
do
by
way
of
salute
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
five
or
six
weeks
before
when
delivering
the
great
lords
of
norfolk
and
surrey
into
his
hands
for
captivity
tom
played
with
the
jewelled
dagger
that
hung
upon
his
thigh
he
examined
the
costly
and
exquisite
ornaments
of
the
room
he
tried
each
of
the
sumptuous
chairs
and
thought
how
proud
he
would
be
if
the
offal
court
herd
could
only
peep
in
and
see
him
in
his
grandeur
he
wondered
if
they
would
believe
the
marvellous
tale
he
should
tell
when
he
got
home
or
if
they
would
shake
their
heads
and
say
his
overtaxed
imagination
had
at
last
upset
his
reason
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
the
prince
was
gone
a
long
time
then
right
away
he
began
to
feel
lonely
very
soon
he
fell
to
listening
and
longing
and
ceased
to
toy
with
the
pretty
things
about
him
he
grew
uneasy
then
restless
then
distressed
suppose
some
one
should
come
and
catch
him
in
the
prince
s
clothes
and
the
prince
not
there
to
explain
might
they
not
hang
him
at
once
and
inquire
into
his
case
afterward
he
had
heard
that
the
great
were
prompt
about
small
matters
his
fear
rose
higher
and
higher
and
trembling
he
softly
opened
the
door
to
the
antechamber
resolved
to
fly
and
seek
the
prince
and
through
him
protection
and
release
six
gorgeous
gentlemen
servants
and
two
young
pages
of
high
degree
clothed
like
butterflies
sprang
to
their
feet
and
bowed
low
before
him
he
stepped
quickly
back
and
shut
the
door
he
said
oh
they
mock
at
me
they
will
go
and
tell
oh
why
came
i
here
to
cast
away
my
life
he
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
filled
with
nameless
fears
listening
starting
at
every
trifling
sound
presently
the
door
swung
open
and
a
silken
page
said
the
lady
jane
grey
the
door
closed
and
a
sweet
young
girl
richly
clad
bounded
toward
him
but
she
stopped
suddenly
and
said
in
a
distressed
voice
oh
what
aileth
thee
my
lord
tom
s
breath
was
nearly
failing
him
but
he
made
shift
to
stammer
out
ah
be
merciful
thou
in
sooth
i
am
no
lord
but
only
poor
tom
canty
of
offal
court
in
the
city
prithee
let
me
see
the
prince
and
he
will
of
his
grace
restore
to
me
my
rags
and
let
me
hence
unhurt
oh
be
thou
merciful
and
save
me
by
this
time
the
boy
was
on
his
knees
and
supplicating
with
his
eyes
and
uplifted
hands
as
well
as
with
his
tongue
the
young
girl
seemed
horror
stricken
she
cried
out
o
my
lord
on
thy
knees
and
to
me
then
she
fled
away
in
fright
and
tom
smitten
with
despair
sank
down
murmuring
there
is
no
help
there
is
no
hope
now
will
they
come
and
take
me
whilst
he
lay
there
benumbed
with
terror
dreadful
tidings
were
speeding
through
the
palace
the
whisper
for
it
was
whispered
always
flew
from
menial
to
menial
from
lord
to
lady
down
all
the
long
corridors
from
story
to
story
from
saloon
to
saloon
the
prince
hath
gone
mad
the
prince
hath
gone
mad
soon
every
saloon
every
marble
hall
had
its
groups
of
glittering
lords
and
ladies
and
other
groups
of
dazzling
lesser
folk
talking
earnestly
together
in
whispers
and
every
face
had
in
it
dismay
presently
a
splendid
official
came
marching
by
these
groups
making
solemn
proclamation
in
the
name
of
the
king
let
none
list
to
this
false
and
foolish
matter
upon
pain
of
death
nor
discuss
the
same
nor
carry
it
abroad
in
the
name
of
the
king
the
whisperings
ceased
as
suddenly
as
if
the
whisperers
had
been
stricken
dumb
soon
there
was
a
general
buzz
along
the
corridors
of
the
prince
see
the
prince
comes
poor
tom
came
slowly
walking
past
the
low
bowing
groups
trying
to
bow
in
return
and
meekly
gazing
upon
his
strange
surroundings
with
bewildered
and
pathetic
eyes
great
nobles
walked
upon
each
side
of
him
making
him
lean
upon
them
and
so
steady
his
steps
behind
him
followed
the
court
physicians
and
some
servants
presently
tom
found
himself
in
a
noble
apartment
of
the
palace
and
heard
the
door
close
behind
him
around
him
stood
those
who
had
come
with
him
before
him
at
a
little
distance
reclined
a
very
large
and
very
fat
man
with
a
wide
pulpy
face
and
a
stern
expression
his
large
head
was
very
grey
and
his
whiskers
which
he
wore
only
around
his
face
like
a
frame
were
grey
also
his
clothing
was
of
rich
stuff
but
old
and
slightly
frayed
in
places
one
of
his
swollen
legs
had
a
pillow
under
it
and
was
wrapped
in
bandages
there
was
silence
now
and
there
was
no
head
there
but
was
bent
in
reverence
except
this
man
s
this
stern
countenanced
invalid
was
the
dread
henry
viii
he
said
and
his
face
grew
gentle
as
he
began
to
speak
how
now
my
lord
edward
my
prince
hast
been
minded
to
cozen
me
the
good
king
thy
father
who
loveth
thee
and
kindly
useth
thee
with
a
sorry
jest
poor
tom
was
listening
as
well
as
his
dazed
faculties
would
let
him
to
the
beginning
of
this
speech
but
when
the
words
me
the
good
king
fell
upon
his
ear
his
face
blanched
and
he
dropped
as
instantly
upon
his
knees
as
if
a
shot
had
brought
him
there
lifting
up
his
hands
he
exclaimed
thou
the
king
then
am
i
undone
indeed
this
speech
seemed
to
stun
the
king
his
eyes
wandered
from
face
to
face
aimlessly
then
rested
bewildered
upon
the
boy
before
him
then
he
said
in
a
tone
of
deep
disappointment
alack
i
had
believed
the
rumour
disproportioned
to
the
truth
but
i
fear
me
tis
not
so
he
breathed
a
heavy
sigh
and
said
in
a
gentle
voice
come
to
thy
father
child
thou
art
not
well
tom
was
assisted
to
his
feet
and
approached
the
majesty
of
england
humble
and
trembling
the
king
took
the
frightened
face
between
his
hands
and
gazed
earnestly
and
lovingly
into
it
awhile
as
if
seeking
some
grateful
sign
of
returning
reason
there
then
pressed
the
curly
head
against
his
breast
and
patted
it
tenderly
presently
he
said
dost
not
know
thy
father
child
break
not
mine
old
heart
say
thou
know
st
me
thou
dost
know
me
dost

upon
his
knees
with
a
glad
cry
god
requite
thy
mercy
o
my
king
and
save
thee
long
to
bless
thy
land
then
springing
up
he
turned
a
joyful
face
toward
the
two
lords
in
waiting
and
exclaimed
thou
heard
st
it
i
am
not
to
die
the
king
hath
said
it
there
was
no
movement
save
that
all
bowed
with
grave
respect
but
no
one
spoke
he
hesitated
a
little
confused
then
turned
timidly
toward
the
king
saying
i
may
go
now
go
surely
if
thou
desirest
but
why
not
tarry
yet
a
little
whither
would
st
go
tom
dropped
his
eyes
and
answered
humbly
peradventure
i
mistook
but
i
did
think
me
free
and
so
was
i
moved
to
seek
again
the
kennel
where
i
was
born
and
bred
to
misery
yet
which
harboureth
my
mother
and
my
sisters
and
so
is
home
to
me
whereas
these
pomps
and
splendours
whereunto
i
am
not
used
oh
please
you
sir
to
let
me
go
the
king
was
silent
and
thoughtful
a
while
and
his
face
betrayed
a
growing
distress
and
uneasiness
presently
he
said
with
something
of
hope
in
his
voice
perchance
he
is
but
mad
upon
this
one
strain
and
hath
his
wits
unmarred
as
toucheth
other
matter
god
send
it
may
be
so
we
will
make
trial
then
he
asked
tom
a
question
in
latin
and
tom
answered
him
lamely
in
the
same
tongue
the
lords
and
doctors
manifested
their
gratification
also
the
king
said
twas
not
according
to
his
schooling
and
ability
but
showeth
that
his
mind
is
but
diseased
not
stricken
fatally
how
say
you
sir
the
physician
addressed
bowed
low
and
replied
it
jumpeth
with
my
own
conviction
sire
that
thou
hast
divined
aright
the
king
looked
pleased
with
this
encouragement
coming
as
it
did
from
so
excellent
authority
and
continued
with
good
heart
now
mark
ye
all
we
will
try
him
further
he
put
a
question
to
tom
in
french
tom
stood
silent
a
moment
embarrassed
by
having
so
many
eyes
centred
upon
him
then
said
diffidently
i
have
no
knowledge
of
this
tongue
so
please
your
majesty
the
king
fell
back
upon
his
couch
the
attendants
flew
to
his
assistance
but
he
put
them
aside
and
said
trouble
me
not
it
is
nothing
but
a
scurvy
faintness
raise
me
there
tis
sufficient
come
hither
child
there
rest
thy
poor
troubled
head
upon
thy
father
s
heart
and
be
at
peace
thou
lt
soon
be
well
tis
but
a
passing
fantasy
fear
thou
not
thou
lt
soon
be
well
then
he
turned
toward
the
company
his
gentle
manner
changed
and
baleful
lightnings
began
to
play
from
his
eyes
he
said
list
ye
all
this
my
son
is
mad
but
it
is
not
permanent
over
study
hath
done
this
and
somewhat
too
much
of
confinement
away
with
his
books
and
teachers
see
ye
to
it
pleasure
him
with
sports
beguile
him
in
wholesome
ways
so
that
his
health
come
again
he
raised
himself
higher
still
and
went
on
with
energy
he
is
mad
but
he
is
my
son
and
england
s
heir
and
mad
or
sane
still
shall
he
reign
and
hear
ye
further
and
proclaim
it
whoso
speaketh
of
this
his
distemper
worketh
against
the
peace
and
order
of
these
realms
and
shall
to
the
gallows
give
me
to
drink
i
burn
this
sorrow
sappeth
my
strength
there
take
away
the
cup
support
me
there
that
is
well
mad
is
he
were
he
a
thousand
times
mad
yet
is
he
prince
of
wales
and
i
the
king
will
confirm
it
this
very
morrow
shall
he
be
installed
in
his
princely
dignity
in
due
and
ancient
form
take
instant
order
for
it
my
lord
hertford
one
of
the
nobles
knelt
at
the
royal
couch
and
said
the
king
s
majesty
knoweth
that
the
hereditary
great
marshal
of
england
lieth
attainted
in
the
tower
it
were
not
meet
that
one
attainted
peace
insult
not
mine
ears
with
his
hated
name
is
this
man
to
live
for
ever
am
i
to
be
baulked
of
my
will
is
the
prince
to
tarry
uninstalled
because
forsooth
the
realm
lacketh
an
earl
marshal
free
of
treasonable
taint
to
invest
him
with
his
honours
no
by
the
splendour
of
god
warn
my
parliament
to
bring
me
norfolk
s
doom
before
the
sun
rise

shall
they
answer
for
it
grievously
1
lord
hertford
said
the
king
s
will
is
law
and
rising
returned
to
his
former
place
gradually
the
wrath
faded
out
of
the
old
king
s
face
and
he
said
kiss
me
my
prince
there
what
fearest
thou
am
i
not
thy
loving
father
thou
art
good
to
me
that
am
unworthy
o
mighty
and
gracious
lord
that
in
truth
i
know
but
but
it
grieveth
me
to
think
of
him
that
is
to
die
and
ah
tis
like
thee
tis
like
thee
i
know
thy
heart
is
still
the
same
even
though
thy
mind
hath
suffered
hurt
for
thou
wert
ever
of
a
gentle
spirit
but
this
duke
standeth
between
thee
and
thine
honours
i
will
have
another
in
his
stead
that
shall
bring
no
taint
to
his
great
office
comfort
thee
my
prince
trouble
not
thy
poor
head
with
this
matter
but
is
it
not
i
that
speed
him
hence
my
liege
how
long
might
he
not
live
but
for
me
take
no
thought
of
him
my
prince
he
is
not
worthy
kiss
me
once
again
and
go
to
thy
trifles
and
amusements
for
my
malady
distresseth
me
i
am
aweary
and
would
rest
go
with
thine
uncle
hertford
and
thy
people
and
come
again
when
my
body
is
refreshed
tom
heavy
hearted
was
conducted
from
the
presence
for
this
last
sentence
was
a
death
blow
to
the
hope
he
had
cherished
that
now
he
would
be
set
free
once
more
he
heard
the
buzz
of
low
voices
exclaiming
the
prince
the
prince
comes
his
spirits
sank
lower
and
lower
as
he
moved
between
the
glittering
files
of
bowing
courtiers
for
he
recognised
that
he
was
indeed
a
captive
now
and
might
remain
for
ever
shut
up
in
this
gilded
cage
a
forlorn
and
friendless
prince
except
god
in
his
mercy
take
pity
on
him
and
set
him
free
and
turn
where
he
would
he
seemed
to
see
floating
in
the
air
the
severed
head
and
the
remembered
face
of
the
great
duke
of
norfolk
the
eyes
fixed
on
him
reproachfully
his
old
dreams
had
been
so
pleasant
but
this
reality
was
so
dreary
chapter
vi
tom
receives
instructions
tom
was
conducted
to
the
principal
apartment
of
a
noble
suite
and
made
to
sit
down
a
thing
which
he
was
loth
to
do
since
there
were
elderly
men
and
men
of
high
degree
about
him
he
begged
them
to
be
seated
also
but
they
only
bowed
their
thanks
or
murmured
them
and
remained
standing
he
would
have
insisted
but
his
uncle
the
earl
of
hertford
whispered
in
his
ear
prithee
insist
not
my
lord
it
is
not
meet
that
they
sit
in
thy
presence
the
lord
st
john
was
announced
and
after
making
obeisance
to
tom
he
said
i
come
upon
the
king
s
errand
concerning
a
matter
which
requireth
privacy
will
it
please
your
royal
highness
to
dismiss
all
that
attend
you
here
save
my
lord
the
earl
of
hertford
observing
that
tom
did
not
seem
to
know
how
to
proceed
hertford
whispered
him
to
make
a
sign
with
his
hand
and
not
trouble
himself
to
speak
unless
he
chose
when
the
waiting
gentlemen
had
retired
lord
st
john
said
his
majesty
commandeth
that
for
due
and
weighty
reasons
of
state
the
prince
s
grace
shall
hide
his
infirmity
in
all
ways
that
be
within
his
power
till
it
be
passed
and
he
be
as
he
was
before
to
wit
that
he
shall
deny
to
none
that
he
is
the
true
prince
and
heir
to
england
s
greatness
that
he
shall
uphold
his
princely
dignity
and
shall
receive
without
word
or
sign
of
protest
that
reverence
and
observance
which
unto
it
do
appertain
of
right
and
ancient
usage
that
he
shall
cease
to
speak
to
any
of
that
lowly
birth
and
life
his
malady
hath
conjured
out
of
the
unwholesome
imaginings
of
o
er
wrought
fancy
that
he
shall
strive
with
diligence
to
bring
unto
his
memory
again
those
faces
which
he
was
wont
to
know
and
where
he
faileth
he
shall
hold
his
peace
neither
betraying
by
semblance
of
surprise
or
other
sign
that
he
hath
forgot
that
upon
occasions
of
state
whensoever
any
matter
shall
perplex
him
as
to
the
thing
he
should
do
or
the
utterance
he
should
make
he
shall
show
nought
of
unrest
to
the
curious
that
look
on
but
take
advice
in
that
matter
of
the
lord
hertford
or
my
humble
self
which
are
commanded
of
the
king
to
be
upon
this
service
and
close
at
call
till
this
commandment
be
dissolved
thus
saith
the
king
s
majesty
who
sendeth
greeting
to
your
royal
highness
and
prayeth
that
god
will
of
his
mercy
quickly
heal
you
and
have
you
now
and
ever
in
his
holy
keeping
the
lord
st
john
made
reverence
and
stood
aside
tom
replied
resignedly
the
king
hath
said
it
none
may
palter
with
the
king
s
command
or
fit
it
to
his
ease
where
it
doth
chafe
with
deft
evasions
the
king
shall
be
obeyed
lord
hertford
said
touching
the
king
s
majesty
s
ordainment
concerning
books
and
such
like
serious
matters
it
may
peradventure
please
your
highness
to
ease
your
time
with
lightsome
entertainment
lest
you
go
wearied
to
the
banquet
and
suffer
harm
thereby
tom
s
face
showed
inquiring
surprise
and
a
blush
followed
when
he
saw
lord
st
john
s
eyes
bent
sorrowfully
upon
him
his
lordship
said
thy
memory
still
wrongeth
thee
and
thou
hast
shown
surprise
but
suffer
it
not
to
trouble
thee
for
tis
a
matter
that
will
not
bide
but
depart
with
thy
mending
malady
my
lord
of
hertford
speaketh
of
the
city
s
banquet
which
the
king
s
majesty
did
promise
some
two
months
flown
your
highness
should
attend
thou
recallest
it
now
it
grieves
me
to
confess
it
had
indeed
escaped
me
said
tom
in
a
hesitating
voice
and
blushed
again
at
this
moment
the
lady
elizabeth
and
the
lady
jane
grey
were
announced
the
two
lords
exchanged
significant
glances
and
hertford
stepped
quickly
toward
the
door
as
the
young
girls
passed
him
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
pray
ye
ladies
seem
not
to
observe
his
humours
nor
show
surprise
when
his
memory
doth
lapse
it
will
grieve
you
to
note
how
it
doth
stick
at
every
trifle
meantime
lord
st
john
was
saying
in
tom
s
ear
please
you
sir
keep
diligently
in
mind
his
majesty
s
desire
remember
all
thou
canst
seem
to
remember
all
else
let
them
not
perceive
that
thou
art
much
changed
from
thy
wont
for
thou
knowest
how
tenderly
thy
old
play
fellows
bear
thee
in
their
hearts
and
how
twould
grieve
them
art
willing
sir
that
i
remain
and
thine
uncle
tom
signified
assent
with
a
gesture
and
a
murmured
word
for
he
was
already
learning
and
in
his
simple
heart
was
resolved
to
acquit
himself
as
best
he
might
according
to
the
king
s
command
in
spite
of
every
precaution
the
conversation
among
the
young
people
became
a
little
embarrassing
at
times
more
than
once
in
truth
tom
was
near
to
breaking
down
and
confessing
himself
unequal
to
his
tremendous
part
but
the
tact
of
the
princess
elizabeth
saved
him
or
a
word
from
one
or
the
other
of
the
vigilant
lords
thrown
in
apparently
by
chance
had
the
same
happy
effect
once
the
little
lady
jane
turned
to
tom
and
dismayed
him
with
this
question
hast
paid
thy
duty
to
the
queen
s
majesty
to
day
my
lord
tom
hesitated
looked
distressed
and
was
about
to
stammer
out
something
at
hazard
when
lord
st
john
took
the
word
and
answered
for
him
with
the
easy
grace
of
a
courtier
accustomed
to
encounter
delicate
difficulties
and
to
be
ready
for
them
he
hath
indeed
madam
and
she
did
greatly
hearten
him
as
touching
his
majesty
s
condition
is
it
not
so
your
highness
tom
mumbled
something
that
stood
for
assent
but
felt
that
he
was
getting
upon
dangerous
ground
somewhat
later
it
was
mentioned
that
tom
was
to
study
no
more
at
present
whereupon
her
little
ladyship
exclaimed
tis
a
pity
tis
a
pity
thou
wert
proceeding
bravely
but
bide
thy
time
in
patience
it
will
not
be
for
long
thou
lt
yet
be
graced
with
learning
like
thy
father
and
make
thy
tongue
master
of
as
many
languages
as
his
good
my
prince
my
father
cried
tom
off
his
guard
for
the
moment
i
trow
he
cannot
speak
his
own
so
that
any
but
the
swine
that
kennel
in
the
styes
may
tell
his
meaning
and
as
for
learning
of
any
sort
soever
he
looked
up
and
encountered
a
solemn
warning
in
my
lord
st
john
s
eyes
he
stopped
blushed
then
continued
low
and
sadly
ah
my
malady
persecuteth
me
again
and
my
mind
wandereth
i
meant
the
king
s
grace
no
irreverence
we
know
it
sir
said
the
princess
elizabeth
taking
her
brother
s
hand
between
her
two
palms
respectfully
but
caressingly
trouble
not
thyself
as
to
that
the
fault
is
none
of
thine
but
thy
distemper
s
thou
rt
a
gentle
comforter
sweet
lady
said
tom
gratefully
and
my
heart
moveth
me
to
thank
thee
for
t
an
i
may
be
so
bold
once
the
giddy
little
lady
jane
fired
a
simple
greek
phrase
at
tom
the
princess
elizabeth
s
quick
eye
saw
by
the
serene
blankness
of
the
target
s
front
that
the
shaft
was
overshot
so
she
tranquilly
delivered
a
return
volley
of
sounding
greek
on
tom
s
behalf
and
then
straightway
changed
the
talk
to
other
matters
time
wore
on
pleasantly
and
likewise
smoothly
on
the
whole
snags
and
sandbars
grew
less
and
less
frequent
and
tom
grew
more
and
more
at
his
ease
seeing
that
all
were
so
lovingly
bent
upon
helping
him
and
overlooking
his
mistakes
when
it
came
out
that
the
little
ladies
were
to
accompany
him
to
the
lord
mayor
s
banquet
in
the
evening
his
heart
gave
a
bound
of
relief
and
delight
for
he
felt
that
he
should
not
be
friendless
now
among
that
multitude
of
strangers
whereas
an
hour
earlier
the
idea
of
their
going
with
him
would
have
been
an
insupportable
terror
to
him
tom
s
guardian
angels
the
two
lords
had
had
less
comfort
in
the
interview
than
the
other
parties
to
it
they
felt
much
as
if
they
were
piloting
a
great
ship
through
a
dangerous
channel
they
were
on
the
alert
constantly
and
found
their
office
no
child
s
play
wherefore
at
last
when
the
ladies
visit
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
lord
guilford
dudley
was
announced
they
not
only
felt
that
their
charge
had
been
sufficiently
taxed
for
the
present
but
also
that
they
themselves
were
not
in
the
best
condition
to
take
their
ship
back
and
make
their
anxious
voyage
all
over
again
so
they
respectfully
advised
tom
to
excuse
himself
which
he
was
very
glad
to
do
although
a
slight
shade
of
disappointment
might
have
been
observed
upon
my
lady
jane
s
face
when
she
heard
the
splendid
stripling
denied
admittance
there
was
a
pause
now
a
sort
of
waiting
silence
which
tom
could
not
understand
he
glanced
at
lord
hertford
who
gave
him
a
sign
but
he
failed
to
understand
that
also
the
ready
elizabeth
came
to
the
rescue
with
her
usual
easy
grace
she
made
reverence
and
said
have
we
leave
of
the
prince
s
grace
my
brother
to
go
tom
said
indeed
your
ladyships
can
have
whatsoever
of
me
they
will
for
the
asking
yet
would
i
rather
give
them
any
other
thing
that
in
my
poor
power
lieth
than
leave
to
take
the
light
and
blessing
of
their
presence
hence
give
ye
good
den
and
god
be
with
ye
then
he
smiled
inwardly
at
the
thought
tis
not
for
nought
i
have
dwelt
but
among
princes
in
my
reading
and
taught
my
tongue
some
slight
trick
of
their
broidered
and
gracious
speech
withal
when
the
illustrious
maidens
were
gone
tom
turned
wearily
to
his
keepers
and
said
may
it
please
your
lordships
to
grant
me
leave
to
go
into
some
corner
and
rest
me
lord
hertford
said
so
please
your
highness
it
is
for
you
to
command
it
is
for
us
to
obey
that
thou
should
st
rest
is
indeed
a
needful
thing
since
thou
must
journey
to
the
city
presently
he
touched
a
bell
and
a
page
appeared
who
was
ordered
to
desire
the
presence
of
sir
william
herbert
this
gentleman
came
straightway
and
conducted
tom
to
an
inner
apartment
tom
s
first
movement
there
was
to
reach
for
a
cup
of
water
but
a
silk
and
velvet
servitor
seized
it
dropped
upon
one
knee
and
offered
it
to
him
on
a
golden
salver
next
the
tired
captive
sat
down
and
was
going
to
take
off
his
buskins
timidly
asking
leave
with
his
eye
but
another
silk
and
velvet
discomforter
went
down
upon
his
knees
and
took
the
office
from
him
he
made
two
or
three
further
efforts
to
help
himself
but
being
promptly
forestalled
each
time
he
finally
gave
up
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
and
a
murmured
beshrew
me
but
i
marvel
they
do
not
require
to
breathe
for
me
also
slippered
and
wrapped
in
a
sumptuous
robe
he
laid
himself
down
at
last
to
rest
but
not
to
sleep
for
his
head
was
too
full
of
thoughts
and
the
room
too
full
of
people
he
could
not
dismiss
the
former
so
they
stayed
he
did
not
know
enough
to
dismiss
the
latter
so
they
stayed
also
to
his
vast
regret
and
theirs
tom
s
departure
had
left
his
two
noble
guardians
alone
they
mused
a
while
with
much
head
shaking
and
walking
the
floor
then
lord
st
john
said
plainly
what
dost
thou
think
plainly
then
this
the
king
is
near
his
end
my
nephew
is
mad
mad
will
mount
the
throne
and
mad
remain
god
protect
england
since
she
will
need
it
verily
it
promiseth
so
indeed
but
have
you
no
misgivings
as
to
as
to
the
speaker
hesitated
and
finally
stopped
he
evidently
felt
that
he
was
upon
delicate
ground
lord
hertford
stopped
before
him
looked
into
his
face
with
a
clear
frank
eye
and
said
speak
on
there
is
none
to
hear
but
me
misgivings
as
to
what
i
am
full
loth
to
word
the
thing
that
is
in
my
mind
and
thou
so
near
to
him
in
blood
my
lord
but
craving
pardon
if
i
do
offend
seemeth
it
not
strange
that
madness
could
so
change
his
port
and
manner
not
but
that
his
port
and
speech
are
princely
still
but
that
they
differ
in
one
unweighty
trifle
or
another
from
what
his
custom
was
aforetime
seemeth
it
not
strange
that
madness
should
filch
from
his
memory
his
father
s
very
lineaments
the
customs
and
observances
that
are
his
due
from
such
as
be
about
him
and
leaving
him
his
latin
strip
him
of
his
greek
and
french
my
lord
be
not
offended
but
ease
my
mind
of
its
disquiet
and
receive
my
grateful
thanks
it
haunteth
me
his
saying
he
was
not
the
prince
and
so
peace
my
lord
thou
utterest
treason
hast
forgot
the
king
s
command
remember
i
am
party
to
thy
crime
if
i
but
listen
st
john
paled
and
hastened
to
say
i
was
in
fault
i
do
confess
it
betray
me
not
grant
me
this
grace
out
of
thy
courtesy
and
i
will
neither
think
nor
speak
of
this
thing
more
deal
not
hardly
with
me
sir
else
am
i
ruined
i
am
content
my
lord
so
thou
offend
not
again
here
or
in
the
ears
of
others
it
shall
be
as
though
thou
hadst
not
spoken
but
thou
need
st
not
have
misgivings
he
is
my
sister
s
son
are
not
his
voice
his
face
his
form
familiar
to
me
from
his
cradle
madness
can
do
all
the
odd
conflicting
things
thou
seest
in
him
and
more
dost
not
recall
how
that
the
old
baron
marley
being
mad
forgot
the
favour
of
his
own
countenance
that
he
had
known
for
sixty
years
and
held
it
was
another
s
nay
even
claimed
he
was
the
son
of
mary
magdalene
and
that
his
head
was
made
of
spanish
glass
and
sooth
to
say
he
suffered
none
to
touch
it
lest
by
mischance
some
heedless
hand
might
shiver
it
give
thy
misgivings
easement
good
my
lord
this
is
the
very
prince
i
know
him
well
and
soon
will
be
thy
king
it
may
advantage
thee
to
bear
this
in
mind
and
more
dwell
upon
it
than
the
other
after
some
further
talk
in
which
the
lord
st
john
covered
up
his
mistake
as
well
as
he
could
by
repeated
protests
that
his
faith
was
thoroughly
grounded
now
and
could
not
be
assailed
by
doubts
again
the
lord
hertford
relieved
his
fellow
keeper
and
sat
down
to
keep
watch
and
ward
alone
he
was
soon
deep
in
meditation
and
evidently
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
he
was
bothered
by
and
by
he
began
to
pace
the
floor
and
mutter
tush
he
must
be
the
prince
will
any
be
in
all
the
land
maintain
there
can
be
two
not
of
one
blood
and
birth
so
marvellously
twinned
and
even
were
it
so
twere
yet
a
stranger
miracle
that
chance
should
cast
the
one
into
the
other
s
place
nay
tis
folly
folly
folly
presently
he
said
now
were
he
impostor
and
called
himself
prince
look
you
that
would
be
natural
that
would
be
reasonable
but
lived
ever
an
impostor
yet
who
being
called
prince
by
the
king
prince
by
the
court
prince
by
all
denied
his
dignity
and
pleaded
against
his
exaltation
no
by
the
soul
of
st
swithin
no
this
is
the
true
prince
gone
mad
chapter
vii
tom
s
first
royal
dinner
somewhat
after
one
in
the
afternoon
tom
resignedly
underwent
the
ordeal
of
being
dressed
for
dinner
he
found
himself
as
finely
clothed
as
before
but
everything
different
everything
changed
from
his
ruff
to
his
stockings
he
was
presently
conducted
with
much
state
to
a
spacious
and
ornate
apartment
where
a
table
was
already
set
for
one
its
furniture
was
all
of
massy
gold
and
beautified
with
designs
which
well
nigh
made
it
priceless
since
they
were
the
work
of
benvenuto
the
room
was
half
filled
with
noble
servitors
a
chaplain
said
grace
and
tom
was
about
to
fall
to
for
hunger
had
long
been
constitutional
with
him
but
was
interrupted
by
my
lord
the
earl
of
berkeley
who
fastened
a
napkin
about
his
neck
for
the
great
post
of
diaperers
to
the
prince
of
wales
was
hereditary
in
this
nobleman
s
family
tom
s
cupbearer
was
present
and
forestalled
all
his
attempts
to
help
himself
to
wine
the
taster
to
his
highness
the
prince
of
wales
was
there
also
prepared
to
taste
any
suspicious
dish
upon
requirement
and
run
the
risk
of
being
poisoned
he
was
only
an
ornamental
appendage
at
this
time
and
was
seldom
called
upon
to
exercise
his
function
but
there
had
been
times
not
many
generations
past
when
the
office
of
taster
had
its
perils
and
was
not
a
grandeur
to
be
desired
why
they
did
not
use
a
dog
or
a
plumber
seems
strange
but
all
the
ways
of
royalty
are
strange
my
lord
d
arcy
first
groom
of
the
chamber
was
there
to
do
goodness
knows
what
but
there
he
was
let
that
suffice
the
lord
chief
butler
was
there
and
stood
behind
tom
s
chair
overseeing
the
solemnities
under
command
of
the
lord
great
steward
and
the
lord
head
cook
who
stood
near
tom
had
three
hundred
and
eighty
four
servants
beside
these
but
they
were
not
all
in
that
room
of
course
nor
the
quarter
of
them
neither
was
tom
aware
yet
that
they
existed
all
those
that
were
present
had
been
well
drilled
within
the
hour
to
remember
that
the
prince
was
temporarily
out
of
his
head
and
to
be
careful
to
show
no
surprise
at
his
vagaries
these
vagaries
were
soon
on
exhibition
before
them
but
they
only
moved
their
compassion
and
their
sorrow
not
their
mirth
it
was
a
heavy
affliction
to
them
to
see
the
beloved
prince
so
stricken
poor
tom
ate
with
his
fingers
mainly
but
no
one
smiled
at
it
or
even
seemed
to
observe
it
he
inspected
his
napkin
curiously
and
with
deep
interest
for
it
was
of
a
very
dainty
and
beautiful
fabric
then
said
with
simplicity
prithee
take
it
away
lest
in
mine
unheedfulness
it
be
soiled
the
hereditary
diaperer
took
it
away
with
reverent
manner
and
without
word
or
protest
of
any
sort
tom
examined
the
turnips
and
the
lettuce
with
interest
and
asked
what
they
were
and
if
they
were
to
be
eaten
for
it
was
only
recently
that
men
had
begun
to
raise
these
things
in
england
in
place
of
importing
them
as
luxuries
from
holland
1
his
question
was
answered
with
grave
respect
and
no
surprise
manifested
when
he
had
finished
his
dessert
he
filled
his
pockets
with
nuts
but
nobody
appeared
to
be
aware
of
it
or
disturbed
by
it
but
the
next
moment
he
was
himself
disturbed
by
it
and
showed
discomposure
for
this
was
the
only
service
he
had
been
permitted
to
do
with
his
own
hands
during
the
meal
and
he
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
done
a
most
improper
and
unprincely
thing
at
that
moment
the
muscles
of
his
nose
began
to
twitch
and
the
end
of
that
organ
to
lift
and
wrinkle
this
continued
and
tom
began
to
evince
a
growing
distress
he
looked
appealingly
first
at
one
and
then
another
of
the
lords
about
him
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
they
sprang
forward
with
dismay
in
their
faces
and
begged
to
know
his
trouble
tom
said
with
genuine
anguish
i
crave
your
indulgence
my
nose
itcheth
cruelly
what
is
the
custom
and
usage
in
this
emergence
prithee
speed
for
tis
but
a
little
time
that
i
can
bear
it
none
smiled
but
all
were
sore
perplexed
and
looked
one
to
the
other
in
deep
tribulation
for
counsel
but
behold
here
was
a
dead
wall
and
nothing
in
english
history
to
tell
how
to
get
over
it
the
master
of
ceremonies
was
not
present
there
was
no
one
who
felt
safe
to
venture
upon
this
uncharted
sea
or
risk
the
attempt
to
solve
this
solemn
problem
alas
there
was
no
hereditary
scratcher
meantime
the
tears
had
overflowed
their
banks
and
begun
to
trickle
down
tom
s
cheeks
his
twitching
nose
was
pleading
more
urgently
than
ever
for
relief
at
last
nature
broke
down
the
barriers
of
etiquette
tom
lifted
up
an
inward
prayer
for
pardon
if
he
was
doing
wrong
and
brought
relief
to
the
burdened
hearts
of
his
court
by
scratching
his
nose
himself
his
meal
being
ended
a
lord
came
and
held
before
him
a
broad
shallow
golden
dish
with
fragrant
rosewater
in
it
to
cleanse
his
mouth
and
fingers
with
and
my
lord
the
hereditary
diaperer
stood
by
with
a
napkin
for
his
use
tom
gazed
at
the
dish
a
puzzled
moment
or
two
then
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
gravely
took
a
draught
then
he
returned
it
to
the
waiting
lord
and
said
nay
it
likes
me
not
my
lord
it
hath
a
pretty
flavour
but
it
wanteth
strength
this
new
eccentricity
of
the
prince
s
ruined
mind
made
all
the
hearts
about
him
ache
but
the
sad
sight
moved
none
to
merriment
tom
s
next
unconscious
blunder
was
to
get
up
and
leave
the
table
just
when
the
chaplain
had
taken
his
stand
behind
his
chair
and
with
uplifted
hands
and
closed
uplifted
eyes
was
in
the
act
of
beginning
the
blessing
still
nobody
seemed
to
perceive
that
the
prince
had
done
a
thing
unusual
by
his
own
request
our
small
friend
was
now
conducted
to
his
private
cabinet
and
left
there
alone
to
his
own
devices
hanging
upon
hooks
in
the
oaken
wainscoting
were
the
several
pieces
of
a
suit
of
shining
steel
armour
covered
all
over
with
beautiful
designs
exquisitely
inlaid
in
gold
this
martial
panoply
belonged
to
the
true
prince
a
recent
present
from
madam
parr
the
queen
tom
put
on
the
greaves
the
gauntlets
the
plumed
helmet
and
such
other
pieces
as
he
could
don
without
assistance
and
for
a
while
was
minded
to
call
for
help
and
complete
the
matter
but
bethought
him
of
the
nuts
he
had
brought
away
from
dinner
and
the
joy
it
would
be
to
eat
them
with
no
crowd
to
eye
him
and
no
grand
hereditaries
to
pester
him
with
undesired
services
so
he
restored
the
pretty
things
to
their
several
places
and
soon
was
cracking
nuts
and
feeling
almost
naturally
happy
for
the
first
time
since
god
for
his
sins
had
made
him
a
prince
when
the
nuts
were
all
gone
he
stumbled
upon
some
inviting
books
in
a
closet
among
them
one
about
the
etiquette
of
the
english
court
this
was
a
prize
he
lay
down
upon
a
sumptuous
divan
and
proceeded
to
instruct
himself
with
honest
zeal
let
us
leave
him
there
for
the
present
chapter
viii
the
question
of
the
seal
about
five
o
clock
henry
viii
awoke
out
of
an
unrefreshing
nap
and
muttered
to
himself
troublous
dreams
troublous
dreams
mine
end
is
now
at
hand
so
say
these
warnings
and
my
failing
pulses
do
confirm
it
presently
a
wicked
light
flamed
up
in
his
eye
and
he
muttered
yet
will
not
i
die
till
he
go
before
his
attendants
perceiving
that
he
was
awake
one
of
them
asked
his
pleasure
concerning
the
lord
chancellor
who
was
waiting
without
admit
him
admit
him
exclaimed
the
king
eagerly
the
lord
chancellor
entered
and
knelt
by
the
king
s
couch
saying
i
have
given
order
and
according
to
the
king
s
command
the
peers
of
the
realm
in
their
robes
do
now
stand
at
the
bar
of
the
house
where
having
confirmed
the
duke
of
norfolk
s
doom
they
humbly
wait
his
majesty
s
further
pleasure
in
the
matter
the
king
s
face
lit
up
with
a
fierce
joy
said
he
lift
me
up
in
mine
own
person
will
i
go
before
my
parliament
and
with
mine
own
hand
will
i
seal
the
warrant
that
rids
me
of
his
voice
failed
an
ashen
pallor
swept
the
flush
from
his
cheeks
and
the
attendants
eased
him
back
upon
his
pillows
and
hurriedly
assisted
him
with
restoratives
presently
he
said
sorrowfully
alack
how
have
i
longed
for
this
sweet
hour
and
lo
too
late
it
cometh
and
i
am
robbed
of
this
so
coveted
chance
but
speed
ye
speed
ye
let
others
do
this
happy
office
sith
tis
denied
to
me
i
put
my
great
seal
in
commission
choose
thou
the
lords
that
shall
compose
it
and
get
ye
to
your
work
speed
ye
man
before
the
sun
shall
rise
and
set
again
bring
me
his
head
that
i
may
see
it
according
to
the
king
s
command
so
shall
it
be
will
t
please
your
majesty
to
order
that
the
seal
be
now
restored
to
me
so
that
i
may
forth
upon
the
business
the
seal
who
keepeth
the
seal
but
thou
please
your
majesty
you
did
take
it
from
me
two
days
since
saying
it
should
no
more
do
its
office
till
your
own
royal
hand
should
use
it
upon
the
duke
of
norfolk
s
warrant
why
so
in
sooth
i
did
i
do
remember
what
did
i
with
it
i
am
very
feeble
so
oft
these
days
doth
my
memory
play
the
traitor
with
me
tis
strange
strange
the
king
dropped
into
inarticulate
mumblings
shaking
his
grey
head
weakly
from
time
to
time
and
gropingly
trying
to
recollect
what
he
had
done
with
the
seal
at
last
my
lord
hertford
ventured
to
kneel
and
offer
information
sire
if
that
i
may
be
so
bold
here
be
several
that
do
remember
with
me
how
that
you
gave
the
great
seal
into
the
hands
of
his
highness
the
prince
of
wales
to
keep
against
the
day
that
true
most
true
interrupted
the
king
fetch
it
go
time
flieth
lord
hertford
flew
to
tom
but
returned
to
the
king
before
very
long
troubled
and
empty
handed
he
delivered
himself
to
this
effect
it
grieveth
me
my
lord
the
king
to
bear
so
heavy
and
unwelcome
tidings
but
it
is
the
will
of
god
that
the
prince
s
affliction
abideth
still
and
he
cannot
recall
to
mind
that
he
received
the
seal
so
came
i
quickly
to
report
thinking
it
were
waste
of
precious
time
and
little
worth
withal
that
any
should
attempt
to
search
the
long
array
of
chambers
and
saloons
that
belong
unto
his
royal
high
a
groan
from
the
king
interrupted
the
lord
at
this
point
after
a
little
while
his
majesty
said
with
a
deep
sadness
in
his
tone
trouble
him
no
more
poor
child
the
hand
of
god
lieth
heavy
upon
him
and
my
heart
goeth
out
in
loving
compassion
for
him
and
sorrow
that
i
may
not
bear
his
burden
on
mine
old
trouble
weighted
shoulders
and
so
bring
him
peace
he
closed
his
eyes
fell
to
mumbling
and
presently
was
silent
after
a
time
he
opened
his
eyes
again
and
gazed
vacantly
around
until
his
glance
rested
upon
the
kneeling
lord
chancellor
instantly
his
face
flushed
with
wrath
what
thou
here
yet
by
the
glory
of
god
an
thou
gettest
not
about
that
traitor
s
business
thy
mitre
shall
have
holiday
the
morrow
for
lack
of
a
head
to
grace
withal
the
trembling
chancellor
answered
good
your
majesty
i
cry
you
mercy
i
but
waited
for
the
seal
man
hast
lost
thy
wits
the
small
seal
which
aforetime
i
was
wont
to
take
with
me
abroad
lieth
in
my
treasury
and
since
the
great
seal
hath
flown
away
shall
not
it
suffice
hast
lost
thy
wits
begone
and
hark
ye
come
no
more
till
thou
do
bring
his
head
the
poor
chancellor
was
not
long
in
removing
himself
from
this
dangerous
vicinity
nor
did
the
commission
waste
time
in
giving
the
royal
assent
to
the
work
of
the
slavish
parliament
and
appointing
the
morrow
for
the
beheading
of
the
premier
peer
of
england
the
luckless
duke
of
norfolk
chapter
ix
the
river
pageant
at
nine
in
the
evening
the
whole
vast
river
front
of
the
palace
was
blazing
with
light
the
river
itself
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
citywards
was
so
thickly
covered
with
watermen
s
boats
and
with
pleasure
barges
all
fringed
with
coloured
lanterns
and
gently
agitated
by
the
waves
that
it
resembled
a
glowing
and
limitless
garden
of
flowers
stirred
to
soft
motion
by
summer
winds
the
grand
terrace
of
stone
steps
leading
down
to
the
water
spacious
enough
to
mass
the
army
of
a
german
principality
upon
was
a
picture
to
see
with
its
ranks
of
royal
halberdiers
in
polished
armour
and
its
troops
of
brilliantly
costumed
servitors
flitting
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
in
the
hurry
of
preparation
presently
a
command
was
given
and
immediately
all
living
creatures
vanished
from
the
steps
now
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
hush
of
suspense
and
expectancy
as
far
as
one
s
vision
could
carry
he
might
see
the
myriads
of
people
in
the
boats
rise
up
and
shade
their
eyes
from
the
glare
of
lanterns
and
torches
and
gaze
toward
the
palace
a
file
of
forty
or
fifty
state
barges
drew
up
to
the
steps
they
were
richly
gilt
and
their
lofty
prows
and
sterns
were
elaborately
carved
some
of
them
were
decorated
with
banners
and
streamers
some
with
cloth
of
gold
and
arras
embroidered
with
coats
of
arms
others
with
silken
flags
that
had
numberless
little
silver
bells
fastened
to
them
which
shook
out
tiny
showers
of
joyous
music
whenever
the
breezes
fluttered
them
others
of
yet
higher
pretensions
since
they
belonged
to
nobles
in
the
prince
s
immediate
service
had
their
sides
picturesquely
fenced
with
shields
gorgeously
emblazoned
with
armorial
bearings
each
state
barge
was
towed
by
a
tender
besides
the
rowers
these
tenders
carried
each
a
number
of
men
at
arms
in
glossy
helmet
and
breastplate
and
a
company
of
musicians
the
advance
guard
of
the
expected
procession
now
appeared
in
the
great
gateway
a
troop
of
halberdiers
they
were
dressed
in
striped
hose
of
black
and
tawny
velvet
caps
graced
at
the
sides
with
silver
roses
and
doublets
of
murrey
and
blue
cloth
embroidered
on
the
front
and
back
with
the
three
feathers
the
prince
s
blazon
woven
in
gold
their
halberd
staves
were
covered
with
crimson
velvet
fastened
with
gilt
nails
and
ornamented
with
gold
tassels
filing
off
on
the
right
and
left
they
formed
two
long
lines
extending
from
the
gateway
of
the
palace
to
the
water
s
edge
a
thick
rayed
cloth
or
carpet
was
then
unfolded
and
laid
down
between
them
by
attendants
in
the
gold
and
crimson
liveries
of
the
prince
this
done
a
flourish
of
trumpets
resounded
from
within
a
lively
prelude
arose
from
the
musicians
on
the
water
and
two
ushers
with
white
wands
marched
with
a
slow
and
stately
pace
from
the
portal
they
were
followed
by
an
officer
bearing
the
civic
mace
after
whom
came
another
carrying
the
city
s
sword
then
several
sergeants
of
the
city
guard
in
their
full
accoutrements
and
with
badges
on
their
sleeves
then
the

king
at

in

then
several

each
with
a

on
his

then
their
esquires
then
the

in
their

then
the

in

of

open
before
and
purfled
with

then
a
deputation
of
aldermen
in
their
scarlet
cloaks
and
then
the
heads
of
the
different
civic
companies
in
their
robes
of
state
now
came
twelve
french
gentlemen
in
splendid
habiliments
consisting
of
pourpoints
of
white
damask
barred
with
gold
short
mantles
of
crimson
velvet
lined
with
violet
taffeta
and
carnation
coloured
hauts
de
chausses
and
took
their
way
down
the
steps
they
were
of
the
suite
of
the
french
ambassador
and
were
followed
by
twelve
cavaliers
of
the
suite
of
the
spanish
ambassador
clothed
in
black
velvet
unrelieved
by
any
ornament
following
these
came
several
great
english
nobles
with
their
attendants
there
was
a
flourish
of
trumpets
within
and
the
prince
s
uncle
the
future
great
duke
of
somerset
emerged
from
the
gateway
arrayed
in
a
doublet
of
black
cloth
of
gold
and
a
cloak
of
crimson
satin
flowered
with
gold
and
ribanded
with
nets
of
silver
he
turned
doffed
his
plumed
cap
bent
his
body
in
a
low
reverence
and
began
to
step
backward
bowing
at
each
step
a
prolonged
trumpet
blast
followed
and
a
proclamation
way
for
the
high
and
mighty
the
lord
edward
prince
of
wales
high
aloft
on
the
palace
walls
a
long
line
of
red
tongues
of
flame
leapt
forth
with
a
thunder
crash
the
massed
world
on
the
river
burst
into
a
mighty
roar
of
welcome
and
tom
canty
the
cause
and
hero
of
it
all
stepped
into
view
and
slightly
bowed
his
princely
head
he
was
magnificently
habited
in
a
doublet
of
white
satin
with
a
front
piece
of
purple
cloth
of
tissue
powdered
with
diamonds
and
edged
with
ermine
over
this
he
wore
a
mantle
of
white
cloth
of
gold
pounced
with
the
triple
feathered
crest
lined
with
blue
satin
set
with
pearls
and
precious
stones
and
fastened
with
a
clasp
of
brilliants
about
his
neck
hung
the
order
of
the
garter
and
several
princely
foreign
orders
and
wherever
light
fell
upon
him
jewels
responded
with
a
blinding
flash
o
tom
canty
born
in
a
hovel
bred
in
the
gutters
of
london
familiar
with
rags
and
dirt
and
misery
what
a
spectacle
is
this
chapter
x
the
prince
in
the
toils
we
left
john
canty
dragging
the
rightful
prince
into
offal
court
with
a
noisy
and
delighted
mob
at
his
heels
there
was
but
one
person
in
it
who
offered
a
pleading
word
for
the
captive
and
he
was
not
heeded
he
was
hardly
even
heard
so
great
was
the
turmoil
the
prince
continued
to
struggle
for
freedom
and
to
rage
against
the
treatment
he
was
suffering
until
john
canty
lost
what
little
patience
was
left
in
him
and
raised
his
oaken
cudgel
in
a
sudden
fury
over
the
prince
s
head
the
single
pleader
for
the
lad
sprang
to
stop
the
man
s
arm
and
the
blow
descended
upon
his
own
wrist
canty
roared
out
thou
lt
meddle
wilt
thou
then
have
thy
reward
his
cudgel
crashed
down
upon
the
meddler
s
head
there
was
a
groan
a
dim
form
sank
to
the
ground
among
the
feet
of
the
crowd
and
the
next
moment
it
lay
there
in
the
dark
alone
the
mob
pressed
on
their
enjoyment
nothing
disturbed
by
this
episode
presently
the
prince
found
himself
in
john
canty
s
abode
with
the
door
closed
against
the
outsiders
by
the
vague
light
of
a
tallow
candle
which
was
thrust
into
a
bottle
he
made
out
the
main
features
of
the
loathsome
den
and
also
the
occupants
of
it
two
frowsy
girls
and
a
middle
aged
woman
cowered
against
the
wall
in
one
corner
with
the
aspect
of
animals
habituated
to
harsh
usage
and
expecting
and
dreading
it
now
from
another
corner
stole
a
withered
hag
with
streaming
grey
hair
and
malignant
eyes
john
canty
said
to
this
one
tarry
there
s
fine
mummeries
here
mar
them
not
till
thou
st
enjoyed
them
then
let
thy
hand
be
heavy
as
thou
wilt
stand
forth
lad
now
say
thy
foolery
again
an
thou
st
not
forgot
it
name
thy
name
who
art
thou
the
insulted
blood
mounted
to
the
little
prince
s
cheek
once
more
and
he
lifted
a
steady
and
indignant
gaze
to
the
man
s
face
and
said
tis
but
ill
breeding
in
such
as
thou
to
command
me
to
speak
i
tell
thee
now
as
i
told
thee
before
i
am
edward
prince
of
wales
and
none
other
the
stunning
surprise
of
this
reply
nailed
the
hag
s
feet
to
the
floor
where
she
stood
and
almost
took
her
breath
she
stared
at
the
prince
in
stupid
amazement
which
so
amused
her
ruffianly
son
that
he
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
but
the
effect
upon
tom
canty
s
mother
and
sisters
was
different
their
dread
of
bodily
injury
gave
way
at
once
to
distress
of
a
different
sort
they
ran
forward
with
woe
and
dismay
in
their
faces
exclaiming
oh
poor
tom
poor
lad
the
mother
fell
on
her
knees
before
the
prince
put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
gazed
yearningly
into
his
face
through
her
rising
tears
then
she
said
oh
my
poor
boy
thy
foolish
reading
hath
wrought
its
woeful
work
at
last
and
ta
en
thy
wit
away
ah
why
did
st
thou
cleave
to
it
when
i
so
warned
thee
gainst
it
thou
st
broke
thy
mother
s
heart
the
prince
looked
into
her
face
and
said
gently
thy
son
is
well
and
hath
not
lost
his
wits
good
dame
comfort
thee
let
me
to
the
palace
where
he
is
and
straightway
will
the
king
my
father
restore
him
to
thee
the
king
thy
father
oh
my
child
unsay
these
words
that
be
freighted
with
death
for
thee
and
ruin
for
all
that
be
near
to
thee
shake
of
this
gruesome
dream
call
back
thy
poor
wandering
memory
look
upon
me
am
not
i
thy
mother
that
bore
thee
and
loveth
thee
the
prince
shook
his
head
and
reluctantly
said
god
knoweth
i
am
loth
to
grieve
thy
heart
but
truly
have
i
never
looked
upon
thy
face
before
the
woman
sank
back
to
a
sitting
posture
on
the
floor
and
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hands
gave
way
to
heart
broken
sobs
and
wailings
let
the
show
go
on
shouted
canty
what
nan
what
bet
mannerless
wenches
will
ye
stand
in
the
prince
s
presence
upon
your
knees
ye
pauper
scum
and
do
him
reverence
he
followed
this
with
another
horse
laugh
the
girls
began
to
plead
timidly
for
their
brother
and
nan
said
an
thou
wilt
but
let
him
to
bed
father
rest
and
sleep
will
heal
his
madness
prithee
do
do
father
said
bet
he
is
more
worn
than
is
his
wont
to
morrow
will
he
be
himself
again
and
will
beg
with
diligence
and
come
not
empty
home
again
this
remark
sobered
the
father
s
joviality
and
brought
his
mind
to
business
he
turned
angrily
upon
the
prince
and
said
the
morrow
must
we
pay
two
pennies
to
him
that
owns
this
hole
two
pennies
mark
ye
all
this
money
for
a
half
year
s
rent
else
out
of
this
we
go
show
what
thou
st
gathered
with
thy
lazy
begging
the
prince
said
offend
me
not
with
thy
sordid
matters
i
tell
thee
again
i
am
the
king
s
son
a
sounding
blow
upon
the
prince
s
shoulder
from
canty
s
broad
palm
sent
him
staggering
into
goodwife
canty
s
arms
who
clasped
him
to
her
breast
and
sheltered
him
from
a
pelting
rain
of
cuffs
and
slaps
by
interposing
her
own
person
the
frightened
girls
retreated
to
their
corner
but
the
grandmother
stepped
eagerly
forward
to
assist
her
son
the
prince
sprang
away
from
mrs
canty
exclaiming
thou
shalt
not
suffer
for
me
madam
let
these
swine
do
their
will
upon
me
alone
this
speech
infuriated
the
swine
to
such
a
degree
that
they
set
about
their
work
without
waste
of
time
between
them
they
belaboured
the
boy
right
soundly
and
then
gave
the
girls
and
their
mother
a
beating
for
showing
sympathy
for
the
victim
now
said
canty
to
bed
all
of
ye
the
entertainment
has
tired
me
the
light
was
put
out
and
the
family
retired
as
soon
as
the
snorings
of
the
head
of
the
house
and
his
mother
showed
that
they
were
asleep
the
young
girls
crept
to
where
the
prince
lay
and
covered
him
tenderly
from
the
cold
with
straw
and
rags
and
their
mother
crept
to
him
also
and
stroked
his
hair
and
cried
over
him
whispering
broken
words
of
comfort
and
compassion
in
his
ear
the
while
she
had
saved
a
morsel
for
him
to
eat
also
but
the
boy
s
pains
had
swept
away
all
appetite
at
least
for
black
and
tasteless
crusts
he
was
touched
by
her
brave
and
costly
defence
of
him
and
by
her
commiseration
and
he
thanked
her
in
very
noble
and
princely
words
and
begged
her
to
go
to
her
sleep
and
try
to
forget
her
sorrows
and
he
added
that
the
king
his
father
would
not
let
her
loyal
kindness
and
devotion
go
unrewarded
this
return
to
his
madness
broke
her
heart
anew
and
she
strained
him
to
her
breast
again
and
again
and
then
went
back
drowned
in
tears
to
her
bed
as
she
lay
thinking
and
mourning
the
suggestion
began
to
creep
into
her
mind
that
there
was
an
undefinable
something
about
this
boy
that
was
lacking
in
tom
canty
mad
or
sane
she
could
not
describe
it
she
could
not
tell
just
what
it
was
and
yet
her
sharp
mother
instinct
seemed
to
detect
it
and
perceive
it
what
if
the
boy
were
really
not
her
son
after
all
oh
absurd
she
almost
smiled
at
the
idea
spite
of
her
griefs
and
troubles
no
matter
she
found
that
it
was
an
idea
that
would
not
down
but
persisted
in
haunting
her
it
pursued
her
it
harassed
her
it
clung
to
her
and
refused
to
be
put
away
or
ignored
at
last
she
perceived
that
there
was
not
going
to
be
any
peace
for
her
until
she
should
devise
a
test
that
should
prove
clearly
and
without
question
whether
this
lad
was
her
son
or
not
and
so
banish
these
wearing
and
worrying
doubts
ah
yes
this
was
plainly
the
right
way
out
of
the
difficulty
therefore
she
set
her
wits
to
work
at
once
to
contrive
that
test
but
it
was
an
easier
thing
to
propose
than
to
accomplish
she
turned
over
in
her
mind
one
promising
test
after
another
but
was
obliged
to
relinquish
them
all
none
of
them
were
absolutely
sure
absolutely
perfect
and
an
imperfect
one
could
not
satisfy
her
evidently
she
was
racking
her
head
in
vain
it
seemed
manifest
that
she
must
give
the
matter
up
while
this
depressing
thought
was
passing
through
her
mind
her
ear
caught
the
regular
breathing
of
the
boy
and
she
knew
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
while
she
listened
the
measured
breathing
was
broken
by
a
soft
startled
cry
such
as
one
utters
in
a
troubled
dream
this
chance
occurrence
furnished
her
instantly
with
a
plan
worth
all
her
laboured
tests
combined
she
at
once
set
herself
feverishly
but
noiselessly
to
work
to
relight
her
candle
muttering
to
herself
had
i
but
seen
him
then
i
should
have
known
since
that
day
when
he
was
little
that
the
powder
burst
in
his
face
he
hath
never
been
startled
of
a
sudden
out
of
his
dreams
or
out
of
his
thinkings
but
he
hath
cast
his
hand
before
his
eyes
even
as
he
did
that
day
and
not
as
others
would
do
it
with
the
palm
inward
but
always
with
the
palm
turned
outward
i
have
seen
it
a
hundred
times
and
it
hath
never
varied
nor
ever
failed
yes
i
shall
soon
know
now
by
this
time
she
had
crept
to
the
slumbering
boy
s
side
with
the
candle
shaded
in
her
hand
she
bent
heedfully
and
warily
over
him
scarcely
breathing
in
her
suppressed
excitement
and
suddenly
flashed
the
light
in
his
face
and
struck
the
floor
by
his
ear
with
her
knuckles
the
sleeper
s
eyes
sprang
wide
open
and
he
cast
a
startled
stare
about
him
but
he
made
no
special
movement
with
his
hands
the
poor
woman
was
smitten
almost
helpless
with
surprise
and
grief
but
she
contrived
to
hide
her
emotions
and
to
soothe
the
boy
to
sleep
again
then
she
crept
apart
and
communed
miserably
with
herself
upon
the
disastrous
result
of
her
experiment
she
tried
to
believe
that
her
tom
s
madness
had
banished
this
habitual
gesture
of
his
but
she
could
not
do
it
no
she
said
his
hands
are
not
mad
they
could
not
unlearn
so
old
a
habit
in
so
brief
a
time
oh
this
is
a
heavy
day
for
me
still
hope
was
as
stubborn
now
as
doubt
had
been
before
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
accept
the
verdict
of
the
test
she
must
try
the
thing
again
the
failure
must
have
been
only
an
accident
so
she
startled
the
boy
out
of
his
sleep
a
second
and
a
third
time
at
intervals
with
the
same
result
which
had
marked
the
first
test
then
she
dragged
herself
to
bed
and
fell
sorrowfully
asleep
saying
but
i
cannot
give
him
up
oh
no
i
cannot
i
cannot
he
must
be
my
boy
the
poor
mother
s
interruptions
having
ceased
and
the
prince
s
pains
having
gradually
lost
their
power
to
disturb
him
utter
weariness
at
last
sealed
his
eyes
in
a
profound
and
restful
sleep
hour
after
hour
slipped
away
and
still
he
slept
like
the
dead
thus
four
or
five
hours
passed
then
his
stupor
began
to
lighten
presently
while
half
asleep
and
half
awake
he
murmured
sir
william
after
a
moment
ho
sir
william
herbert
hie
thee
hither
and
list
to
the
strangest
dream
that
ever
sir
william
dost
hear
man
i
did
think
me
changed
to
a
pauper
and
ho
there
guards
sir
william
what
is
there
no
groom
of
the
chamber
in
waiting
alack
it
shall
go
hard
with
what
aileth
thee
asked
a
whisper
near
him
who
art
thou
calling
sir
william
herbert
who
art
thou
i
who
should
i
be
but
thy
sister
nan
oh
tom
i
had
forgot
thou
rt
mad
yet
poor
lad
thou
rt
mad
yet
would
i
had
never
woke
to
know
it
again
but
prithee
master
thy
tongue
lest
we
be
all
beaten
till
we
die
the
startled
prince
sprang
partly
up
but
a
sharp
reminder
from
his
stiffened
bruises
brought
him
to
himself
and
he
sank
back
among
his
foul
straw
with
a
moan
and
the
ejaculation
alas
it
was
no
dream
then
in
a
moment
all
the
heavy
sorrow
and
misery
which
sleep
had
banished
were
upon
him
again
and
he
realised
that
he
was
no
longer
a
petted
prince
in
a
palace
with
the
adoring
eyes
of
a
nation
upon
him
but
a
pauper
an
outcast
clothed
in
rags
prisoner
in
a
den
fit
only
for
beasts
and
consorting
with
beggars
and
thieves
in
the
midst
of
his
grief
he
began
to
be
conscious
of
hilarious
noises
and
shoutings
apparently
but
a
block
or
two
away
the
next
moment
there
were
several
sharp
raps
at
the
door
john
canty
ceased
from
snoring
and
said
who
knocketh
what
wilt
thou
a
voice
answered
know
st
thou
who
it
was
thou
laid
thy
cudgel
on
no
neither

i
nor
care
belike
thou
lt
change
thy
note
eftsoons
an
thou
would
save
thy
neck
nothing
but
flight
may
stead
thee
the
man
is
this
moment
delivering
up
the
ghost
tis
the
priest
father
andrew
god
a
mercy
exclaimed
canty
he
roused
his
family
and
hoarsely
commanded
up
with
ye
all
and
fly
or
bide
where
ye
are
and
perish
scarcely
five
minutes
later
the
canty
household
were
in
the
street
and
flying
for
their
lives
john
canty
held
the
prince
by
the
wrist
and
hurried
him
along
the
dark
way
giving
him
this
caution
in
a
low
voice
mind
thy
tongue
thou
mad
fool
and
speak
not
our
name
i
will
choose
me
a
new
name
speedily
to
throw
the
law
s
dogs
off
the
scent
mind
thy
tongue
i
tell
thee
he
growled
these
words
to
the
rest
of
the
family
if
it
so
chance
that
we
be
separated
let
each
make
for
london
bridge
whoso
findeth
himself
as
far
as
the
last
linen
draper
s
shop
on
the
bridge
let
him
tarry
there
till
the
others
be
come
then
will
we
flee
into
southwark
together
at
this
moment
the
party
burst
suddenly
out
of
darkness
into
light
and
not
only
into
light
but
into
the
midst
of
a
multitude
of
singing
dancing
and
shouting
people
massed
together
on
the
river
frontage
there
was
a
line
of
bonfires
stretching
as
far
as
one
could
see
up
and
down
the
thames
london
bridge
was
illuminated
southwark
bridge
likewise
the
entire
river
was
aglow
with
the
flash
and
sheen
of
coloured
lights
and
constant
explosions
of
fireworks
filled
the
skies
with
an
intricate
commingling
of
shooting
splendours
and
a
thick
rain
of
dazzling
sparks
that
almost
turned
night
into
day
everywhere
were
crowds
of
revellers
all
london
seemed
to
be
at
large
john
canty
delivered
himself
of
a
furious
curse
and
commanded
a
retreat
but
it
was
too
late
he
and
his
tribe
were
swallowed
up
in
that
swarming
hive
of
humanity
and
hopelessly
separated
from
each
other
in
an
instant
we
are
not
considering
that
the
prince
was
one
of
his
tribe
canty
still
kept
his
grip
upon
him
the
prince
s
heart
was
beating
high
with
hopes
of
escape
now
a
burly
waterman
considerably
exalted
with
liquor
found
himself
rudely
shoved
by
canty
in
his
efforts
to
plough
through
the
crowd
he
laid
his
great
hand
on
canty
s
shoulder
and
said
nay
whither
so
fast
friend
dost
canker
thy
soul
with
sordid
business
when
all
that
be
leal
men
and
true
make
holiday
mine
affairs
are
mine
own
they
concern
thee
not
answered
canty
roughly
take
away
thy
hand
and
let
me
pass
sith
that
is
thy
humour
thou
lt
not
pass
till
thou
st
drunk
to
the
prince
of
wales
i
tell
thee
that
said
the
waterman
barring
the
way
resolutely
give
me
the
cup
then
and
make
speed
make
speed
other
revellers
were
interested
by
this
time
they
cried
out
the
loving
cup
the
loving
cup
make
the
sour
knave
drink
the
loving
cup
else
will
we
feed
him
to
the
fishes
so
a
huge
loving
cup
was
brought
the
waterman
grasping
it
by
one
of
its
handles
and
with
the
other
hand
bearing
up
the
end
of
an
imaginary
napkin
presented
it
in
due
and
ancient
form
to
canty
who
had
to
grasp
the
opposite
handle
with
one
of
his
hands
and
take
off
the
lid
with
the
other
according
to
ancient
custom
this
left
the
prince
hand
free
for
a
second
of
course
he
wasted
no
time
but
dived
among
the
forest
of
legs
about
him
and
disappeared
in
another
moment
he
could
not
have
been
harder
to
find
under
that
tossing
sea
of
life
if
its
billows
had
been
the
atlantic
s
and
he
a
lost
sixpence
he
very
soon
realised
this
fact
and
straightway
busied
himself
about
his
own
affairs
without
further
thought
of
john
canty
he
quickly
realised
another
thing
too
to
wit
that
a
spurious
prince
of
wales
was
being
feasted
by
the
city
in
his
stead
he
easily
concluded
that
the
pauper
lad
tom
canty
had
deliberately
taken
advantage
of
his
stupendous
opportunity
and
become
a
usurper
therefore
there
was
but
one
course
to
pursue
find
his
way
to
the
guildhall
make
himself
known
and
denounce
the
impostor
he
also
made
up
his
mind
that
tom
should
be
allowed
a
reasonable
time
for
spiritual
preparation
and
then
be
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
according
to
the
law
and
usage
of
the
day
in
cases
of
high
treason
chapter
xi
at
guildhall
the
royal
barge
attended
by
its
gorgeous
fleet
took
its
stately
way
down
the
thames
through
the
wilderness
of
illuminated
boats
the
air
was
laden
with
music
the
river
banks
were
beruffled
with
joy
flames
the
distant
city
lay
in
a
soft
luminous
glow
from
its
countless
invisible
bonfires
above
it
rose
many
a
slender
spire
into
the
sky
incrusted
with
sparkling
lights
wherefore
in
their
remoteness
they
seemed
like
jewelled
lances
thrust
aloft
as
the
fleet
swept
along
it
was
greeted
from
the
banks
with
a
continuous
hoarse
roar
of
cheers
and
the
ceaseless
flash
and
boom
of
artillery
to
tom
canty
half
buried
in
his
silken
cushions
these
sounds
and
this
spectacle
were
a
wonder
unspeakably
sublime
and
astonishing
to
his
little
friends
at
his
side
the
princess
elizabeth
and
the
lady
jane
grey
they
were
nothing
arrived
at
the
dowgate
the
fleet
was
towed
up
the
limpid
walbrook
whose
channel
has
now
been
for
two
centuries
buried
out
of
sight
under
acres
of
buildings
to
bucklersbury
past
houses
and
under
bridges
populous
with
merry
makers
and
brilliantly
lighted
and
at
last
came
to
a
halt
in
a
basin
where
now
is
barge
yard
in
the
centre
of
the
ancient
city
of
london
tom
disembarked
and
he
and
his
gallant
procession
crossed
cheapside
and
made
a
short
march
through
the
old
jewry
and
basinghall
street
to
the
guildhall
tom
and
his
little
ladies
were
received
with
due
ceremony
by
the
lord
mayor
and
the
fathers
of
the
city
in
their
gold
chains
and
scarlet
robes
of
state
and
conducted
to
a
rich
canopy
of
state
at
the
head
of
the
great
hall
preceded
by
heralds
making
proclamation
and
by
the
mace
and
the
city
sword
the
lords
and
ladies
who
were
to
attend
upon
tom
and
his
two
small
friends
took
their
places
behind
their
chairs
at
a
lower
table
the
court
grandees
and
other
guests
of
noble
degree
were
seated
with
the
magnates
of
the
city
the
commoners
took
places
at
a
multitude
of
tables
on
the
main
floor
of
the
hall
from
their
lofty
vantage
ground
the
giants
gog
and
magog
the
ancient
guardians
of
the
city
contemplated
the
spectacle
below
them
with
eyes
grown
familiar
to
it
in
forgotten
generations
there
was
a
bugle
blast
and
a
proclamation
and
a
fat
butler
appeared
in
a
high
perch
in
the
leftward
wall
followed
by
his
servitors
bearing
with
impressive
solemnity
a
royal
baron
of
beef
smoking
hot
and
ready
for
the
knife
after
grace
tom
being
instructed
rose
and
the
whole
house
with
him
and
drank
from
a
portly
golden
loving
cup
with
the
princess
elizabeth
from
her
it
passed
to
the
lady
jane
and
then
traversed
the
general
assemblage
so
the
banquet
began
by
midnight
the
revelry
was
at
its
height
now
came
one
of
those
picturesque
spectacles
so
admired
in
that
old
day
a
description
of
it
is
still
extant
in
the
quaint
wording
of
a
chronicler
who
witnessed
it
space
being
made
presently
entered
a
baron
and
an
earl
appareled
after
the
turkish
fashion
in
long
robes
of
bawdkin
powdered
with
gold
hats
on
their
heads
of
crimson
velvet
with
great
rolls
of
gold
girded
with
two
swords
called
scimitars
hanging
by
great
bawdricks
of
gold
next
came
yet
another
baron
and
another
earl
in
two
long
gowns
of
yellow
satin
traversed
with
white
satin
and
in
every
bend
of
white
was
a
bend
of
crimson
satin
after
the
fashion
of
russia
with
furred
hats
of
gray
on
their
heads
either
of
them
having
an
hatchet
in
their
hands
and
boots
with
pykes
points
a
foot
long
turned
up
and
after
them
came
a
knight
then
the
lord
high
admiral
and
with
him
five
nobles
in
doublets
of
crimson
velvet
voyded
low
on
the
back
and
before
to
the
cannell
bone
laced
on
the
breasts
with
chains
of
silver
and
over
that
short
cloaks
of
crimson
satin
and
on
their
heads
hats
after
the
dancers
fashion
with
pheasants
feathers
in
them
these
were
appareled
after
the
fashion
of
prussia
the
torchbearers
which
were
about
an
hundred
were
appareled
in
crimson
satin
and
green
like
moors
their
faces
black
next
came
in
a
mommarye
then
the
minstrels
which
were
disguised
danced
and
the
lords
and
ladies
did
wildly
dance
also
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
behold
and
while
tom
in
his
high
seat
was
gazing
upon
this
wild
dancing
lost
in
admiration
of
the
dazzling
commingling
of
kaleidoscopic
colours
which
the
whirling
turmoil
of
gaudy
figures
below
him
presented
the
ragged
but
real
little
prince
of
wales
was
proclaiming
his
rights
and
his
wrongs
denouncing
the
impostor
and
clamouring
for
admission
at
the
gates
of
guildhall
the
crowd
enjoyed
this
episode
prodigiously
and
pressed
forward
and
craned
their
necks
to
see
the
small
rioter
presently
they
began
to
taunt
him
and
mock
at
him
purposely
to
goad
him
into
a
higher
and
still
more
entertaining
fury
tears
of
mortification
sprang
to
his
eyes
but
he
stood
his
ground
and
defied
the
mob
right
royally
other
taunts
followed
added
mockings
stung
him
and
he
exclaimed
i
tell
ye
again
you
pack
of
unmannerly
curs
i
am
the
prince
of
wales
and
all
forlorn
and
friendless
as
i
be
with
none
to
give
me
word
of
grace
or
help
me
in
my
need
yet
will
not
i
be
driven
from
my
ground
but
will
maintain
it
though
thou
be
prince
or
no
prince
tis
all
one
thou
be
st
a
gallant
lad
and
not
friendless
neither
here
stand
i
by
thy
side
to
prove
it
and
mind
i
tell
thee
thou
might
st
have
a
worser
friend
than
miles
hendon
and
yet
not
tire
thy
legs
with
seeking
rest
thy
small
jaw
my
child
i
talk
the
language
of
these
base
kennel
rats
like
to
a
very
native
the
speaker
was
a
sort
of
don
caesar
de
bazan
in
dress
aspect
and
bearing
he
was
tall
trim
built
muscular
his
doublet
and
trunks
were
of
rich
material
but
faded
and
threadbare
and
their
gold
lace
adornments
were
sadly
tarnished
his
ruff
was
rumpled
and
damaged
the
plume
in
his
slouched
hat
was
broken
and
had
a
bedraggled
and
disreputable
look
at
his
side
he
wore
a
long
rapier
in
a
rusty
iron
sheath
his
swaggering
carriage
marked
him
at
once
as
a
ruffler
of
the
camp
the
speech
of
this
fantastic
figure
was
received
with
an
explosion
of
jeers
and
laughter
some
cried
tis
another
prince
in
disguise
ware
thy
tongue
friend
belike
he
is
dangerous
marry
he
looketh
it
mark
his
eye
pluck
the
lad
from
him
to
the
horse
pond
wi
the
cub
instantly
a
hand
was
laid
upon
the
prince
under
the
impulse
of
this
happy
thought
as
instantly
the
stranger
s
long
sword
was
out
and
the
meddler
went
to
the
earth
under
a
sounding
thump
with
the
flat
of
it
the
next
moment
a
score
of
voices
shouted
kill
the
dog
kill
him
kill
him
and
the
mob
closed
in
on
the
warrior
who
backed
himself
against
a
wall
and
began
to
lay
about
him
with
his
long
weapon
like
a
madman
his
victims
sprawled
this
way
and
that
but
the
mob
tide
poured
over
their
prostrate
forms
and
dashed
itself
against
the
champion
with
undiminished
fury
his
moments
seemed
numbered
his
destruction
certain
when
suddenly
a
trumpet
blast
sounded
a
voice
shouted
way
for
the
king
s
messenger
and
a
troop
of
horsemen
came
charging
down
upon
the
mob
who
fled
out
of
harm
s
reach
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
the
bold
stranger
caught
up
the
prince
in
his
arms
and
was
soon
far
away
from
danger
and
the
multitude
return
we
within
the
guildhall
suddenly
high
above
the
jubilant
roar
and
thunder
of
the
revel
broke
the
clear
peal
of
a
bugle
note
there
was
instant
silence
a
deep
hush
then
a
single
voice
rose
that
of
the
messenger
from
the
palace
and
began
to
pipe
forth
a
proclamation
the
whole
multitude
standing
listening
the
closing
words
solemnly
pronounced
were
the
king
is
dead
the
great
assemblage
bent
their
heads
upon
their
breasts
with
one
accord
remained
so
in
profound
silence
a
few
moments
then
all
sank
upon
their
knees
in
a
body
stretched
out
their
hands
toward
tom
and
a
mighty
shout
burst
forth
that
seemed
to
shake
the
building
long
live
the
king
poor
tom
s
dazed
eyes
wandered
abroad
over
this
stupefying
spectacle
and
finally
rested
dreamily
upon
the
kneeling
princesses
beside
him
a
moment
then
upon
the
earl
of
hertford
a
sudden
purpose
dawned
in
his
face
he
said
in
a
low
tone
at
lord
hertford
s
ear
answer
me
truly
on
thy
faith
and
honour
uttered
i
here
a
command
the
which
none
but
a
king
might
hold
privilege
and
prerogative
to
utter
would
such
commandment
be
obeyed
and
none
rise
up
to
say
me
nay
none
my
liege
in
all
these
realms
in
thy
person
bides
the
majesty
of
england
thou
art
the
king
thy
word
is
law
tom
responded
in
a
strong
earnest
voice
and
with
great
animation
then
shall
the
king
s
law
be
law
of
mercy
from
this
day
and
never
more
be
law
of
blood
up
from
thy
knees
and
away
to
the
tower
and
say
the
king
decrees
the
duke
of
norfolk
shall
not
die
the
words
were
caught
up
and
carried
eagerly
from
lip
to
lip
far
and
wide
over
the
hall
and
as
hertford
hurried
from
the
presence
another
prodigious
shout
burst
forth
the
reign
of
blood
is
ended
long
live
edward
king
of
england
chapter
xii
the
prince
and
his
deliverer
as
soon
as
miles
hendon
and
the
little
prince
were
clear
of
the
mob
they
struck
down
through
back
lanes
and
alleys
toward
the
river
their
way
was
unobstructed
until
they
approached
london
bridge
then
they
ploughed
into
the
multitude
again
hendon
keeping
a
fast
grip
upon
the
prince
s
no
the
king
s
wrist
the
tremendous
news
was
already
abroad
and
the
boy
learned
it
from
a
thousand
voices
at
once
the
king
is
dead
the
tidings
struck
a
chill
to
the
heart
of
the
poor
little
waif
and
sent
a
shudder
through
his
frame
he
realised
the
greatness
of
his
loss
and
was
filled
with
a
bitter
grief
for
the
grim
tyrant
who
had
been
such
a
terror
to
others
had
always
been
gentle
with
him
the
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
and
blurred
all
objects
for
an
instant
he
felt
himself
the
most
forlorn
outcast
and
forsaken
of
god
s
creatures
then
another
cry
shook
the
night
with
its
far
reaching
thunders
long
live
king
edward
the
sixth
and
this
made
his
eyes
kindle
and
thrilled
him
with
pride
to
his
fingers
ends
ah
he
thought
how
grand
and
strange
it
seems
i
am
king
our
friends
threaded
their
way
slowly
through
the
throngs
upon
the
bridge
this
structure
which
had
stood
for
six
hundred
years
and
had
been
a
noisy
and
populous
thoroughfare
all
that
time
was
a
curious
affair
for
a
closely
packed
rank
of
stores
and
shops
with
family
quarters
overhead
stretched
along
both
sides
of
it
from
one
bank
of
the
river
to
the
other
the
bridge
was
a
sort
of
town
to
itself
it
had
its
inn
its
beer
houses
its
bakeries
its
haberdasheries
its
food
markets
its
manufacturing
industries
and
even
its
church
it
looked
upon
the
two
neighbours
which
it
linked
together
london
and
southwark
as
being
well
enough
as
suburbs
but
not
otherwise
particularly
important
it
was
a
close
corporation
so
to
speak
it
was
a
narrow
town
of
a
single
street
a
fifth
of
a
mile
long
its
population
was
but
a
village
population
and
everybody
in
it
knew
all
his
fellow
townsmen
intimately
and
had
known
their
fathers
and
mothers
before
them
and
all
their
little
family
affairs
into
the
bargain
it
had
its
aristocracy
of
course
its
fine
old
families
of
butchers
and
bakers
and
what
not
who
had
occupied
the
same
old
premises
for
five
or
six
hundred
years
and
knew
the
great
history
of
the
bridge
from
beginning
to
end
and
all
its
strange
legends
and
who
always
talked
bridgy
talk
and
thought
bridgy
thoughts
and
lied
in
a
long
level
direct
substantial
bridgy
way
it
was
just
the
sort
of
population
to
be
narrow
and
ignorant
and
self
conceited
children
were
born
on
the
bridge
were
reared
there
grew
to
old
age
and
finally
died
without
ever
having
set
a
foot
upon
any
part
of
the
world
but
london
bridge
alone
such
people
would
naturally
imagine
that
the
mighty
and
interminable
procession
which
moved
through
its
street
night
and
day
with
its
confused
roar
of
shouts
and
cries
its
neighings
and
bellowing
and
bleatings
and
its
muffled
thunder
tramp
was
the
one
great
thing
in
this
world
and
themselves
somehow
the
proprietors
of
it
and
so
they
were
in
effect
at
least
they
could
exhibit
it
from
their
windows
and
did
for
a
consideration
whenever
a
returning
king
or
hero
gave
it
a
fleeting
splendour
for
there
was
no
place
like
it
for
affording
a
long
straight
uninterrupted
view
of
marching
columns
men
born
and
reared
upon
the
bridge
found
life
unendurably
dull
and
inane
elsewhere
history
tells
of
one
of
these
who
left
the
bridge
at
the
age
of
seventy
one
and
retired
to
the
country
but
he
could
only
fret
and
toss
in
his
bed
he
could
not
go
to
sleep
the
deep
stillness
was
so
painful
so
awful
so
oppressive
when
he
was
worn
out
with
it
at
last
he
fled
back
to
his
old
home
a
lean
and
haggard
spectre
and
fell
peacefully
to
rest
and
pleasant
dreams
under
the
lulling
music
of
the
lashing
waters
and
the
boom
and
crash
and
thunder
of
london
bridge
in
the
times
of
which
we
are
writing
the
bridge
furnished
object
lessons
in
english
history
for
its
children
namely
the
livid
and
decaying
heads
of
renowned
men
impaled
upon
iron
spikes
atop
of
its
gateways
but
we
digress
hendon
s
lodgings
were
in
the
little
inn
on
the
bridge
as
he
neared
the
door
with
his
small
friend
a
rough
voice
said
so
thou
rt
come
at
last
thou
lt
not
escape
again
i
warrant
thee
and
if
pounding
thy
bones
to
a
pudding
can
teach
thee
somewhat
thou
lt
not
keep
us
waiting
another
time
mayhap
and
john
canty
put
out
his
hand
to
seize
the
boy
miles
hendon
stepped
in
the
way
and
said
not
too
fast
friend
thou
art
needlessly
rough
methinks
what
is
the
lad
to
thee
if
it
be
any
business
of
thine
to
make
and
meddle
in
others
affairs
he
is
my
son
tis
a
lie
cried
the
little
king
hotly
boldly
said
and
i
believe
thee
whether
thy
small
headpiece
be
sound
or
cracked
my
boy
but
whether
this
scurvy
ruffian
be
thy
father
or
no
tis
all
one
he
shall
not
have
thee
to
beat
thee
and
abuse
according
to
his
threat
so
thou
prefer
to
bide
with
me
i
do
i
do
i
know
him
not
i
loathe
him
and
will
die
before
i
will
go
with
him
then
tis
settled
and
there
is
nought
more
to
say
we
will
see
as
to
that
exclaimed
john
canty
striding
past
hendon
to
get
at
the
boy
by
force
shall
he
if
thou
do
but
touch
him
thou
animated
offal
i
will
spit
thee
like
a
goose
said
hendon
barring
the
way
and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
hilt
canty
drew
back
now
mark
ye
continued
hendon
i
took
this
lad
under
my
protection
when
a
mob
of
such
as
thou
would
have
mishandled
him
mayhap
killed
him
dost
imagine
i
will
desert
him
now
to
a
worser
fate
for
whether
thou
art
his
father
or
no
and
sooth
to
say
i
think
it
is
a
lie
a
decent
swift
death
were
better
for
such
a
lad
than
life
in
such
brute
hands
as
thine
so
go
thy
ways
and
set
quick
about
it
for
i
like
not
much
bandying
of
words
being
not
over
patient
in
my
nature
john
canty
moved
off
muttering
threats
and
curses
and
was
swallowed
from
sight
in
the
crowd
hendon
ascended
three
flights
of
stairs
to
his
room
with
his
charge
after
ordering
a
meal
to
be
sent
thither
it
was
a
poor
apartment
with
a
shabby
bed
and
some
odds
and
ends
of
old
furniture
in
it
and
was
vaguely
lighted
by
a
couple
of
sickly
candles
the
little
king
dragged
himself
to
the
bed
and
lay
down
upon
it
almost
exhausted
with
hunger
and
fatigue
he
had
been
on
his
feet
a
good
part
of
a
day
and
a
night
for
it
was
now
two
or
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
had
eaten
nothing
meantime
he
murmured
drowsily
prithee
call
me
when
the
table
is
spread
and
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
immediately
a
smile
twinkled
in
hendon
s
eye
and
he
said
to
himself
by
the
mass
the
little
beggar
takes
to
one
s
quarters
and
usurps
one
s
bed
with
as
natural
and
easy
a
grace
as
if
he
owned
them
with
never
a
by
your
leave
or
so
please
it
you
or
anything
of
the
sort
in
his
diseased
ravings
he
called
himself
the
prince
of
wales
and
bravely
doth
he
keep
up
the
character
poor
little
friendless
rat
doubtless
his
mind
has
been
disordered
with
ill
usage
well
i
will
be
his
friend
i
have
saved
him
and
it
draweth
me
strongly
to
him
already
i
love
the
bold
tongued
little
rascal
how
soldier
like
he
faced
the
smutty
rabble
and
flung
back
his
high
defiance
and
what
a
comely
sweet
and
gentle
face
he
hath
now
that
sleep
hath
conjured
away
its
troubles
and
its
griefs
i
will
teach
him
i
will
cure
his
malady
yea
i
will
be
his
elder
brother
and
care
for
him
and
watch
over
him
and
whoso
would
shame
him
or
do
him
hurt
may
order
his
shroud
for
though
i
be
burnt
for
it
he
shall
need
it
he
bent
over
the
boy
and
contemplated
him
with
kind
and
pitying
interest
tapping
the
young
cheek
tenderly
and
smoothing
back
the
tangled
curls
with
his
great
brown
hand
a
slight
shiver
passed
over
the
boy
s
form
hendon
muttered
see
now
how
like
a
man
it
was
to
let
him
lie
here
uncovered
and
fill
his
body
with
deadly
rheums
now
what
shall
i
do
twill
wake
him
to
take
him
up
and
put
him
within
the
bed
and
he
sorely
needeth
sleep
he
looked
about
for
extra
covering
but
finding
none
doffed
his
doublet
and
wrapped
the
lad
in
it
saying
i
am
used
to
nipping
air
and
scant
apparel
tis
little
i
shall
mind
the
cold
then
walked
up
and
down
the
room
to
keep
his
blood
in
motion
soliloquising
as
before
his
injured
mind
persuades
him
he
is
prince
of
wales
twill
be
odd
to
have
a
prince
of
wales
still
with
us
now
that
he
that
was
the
prince
is
prince
no
more
but
king
for
this
poor
mind
is
set
upon
the
one
fantasy
and
will
not
reason
out
that
now
it
should
cast
by
the
prince
and
call
itself
the
king
if
my
father
liveth
still
after
these
seven
years
that
i
have
heard
nought
from
home
in
my
foreign
dungeon
he
will
welcome
the
poor
lad
and
give
him
generous
shelter
for
my
sake
so
will
my
good
elder
brother
arthur
my
other
brother
hugh
but
i
will
crack
his
crown
an
he
interfere
the
fox
hearted
ill
conditioned
animal
yes
thither
will
we
fare
and
straightway
too
a
servant
entered
with
a
smoking
meal
disposed
it
upon
a
small
deal
table
placed
the
chairs
and
took
his
departure
leaving
such
cheap
lodgers
as
these
to
wait
upon
themselves
the
door
slammed
after
him
and
the
noise
woke
the
boy
who
sprang
to
a
sitting
posture
and
shot
a
glad
glance
about
him
then
a
grieved
look
came
into
his
face
and
he
murmured
to
himself
with
a
deep
sigh
alack
it
was
but
a
dream
woe
is
me
next
he
noticed
miles
hendon
s
doublet
glanced
from
that
to
hendon
comprehended
the
sacrifice
that
had
been
made
for
him
and
said
gently
thou
art
good
to
me
yes
thou
art
very
good
to
me
take
it
and
put
it
on
i
shall
not
need
it
more
then
he
got
up
and
walked
to
the
washstand
in
the
corner
and
stood
there
waiting
hendon
said
in
a
cheery
voice
we
ll
have
a
right
hearty
sup
and
bite
now
for
everything
is
savoury
and
smoking
hot
and
that
and
thy
nap
together
will
make
thee
a
little
man
again
never
fear
the
boy
made
no
answer
but
bent
a
steady
look
that
was
filled
with
grave
surprise
and
also
somewhat
touched
with
impatience
upon
the
tall
knight
of
the
sword
hendon
was
puzzled
and
said
what
s
amiss
good
sir
i
would
wash
me
oh
is
that
all
ask
no
permission
of
miles
hendon
for
aught
thou
cravest
make
thyself
perfectly
free
here
and
welcome
with
all
that
are
his
belongings
still
the
boy
stood
and
moved
not
more
he
tapped
the
floor
once
or
twice
with
his
small
impatient
foot
hendon
was
wholly
perplexed
said
he
bless
us
what
is
it
prithee
pour
the
water
and
make
not
so
many
words
hendon
suppressing
a
horse
laugh
and
saying
to
himself
by
all
the
saints
but
this
is
admirable
stepped
briskly
forward
and
did
the
small
insolent
s
bidding
then
stood
by
in
a
sort
of
stupefaction
until
the
command
come
the
towel
woke
him
sharply
up
he
took
up
a
towel
from
under
the
boy
s
nose
and
handed
it
to
him
without
comment
he
now
proceeded
to
comfort
his
own
face
with
a
wash
and
while
he
was
at
it
his
adopted
child
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
prepared
to
fall
to
hendon
despatched
his
ablutions
with
alacrity
then
drew
back
the
other
chair
and
was
about
to
place
himself
at
table
when
the
boy
said
indignantly
forbear
wouldst
sit
in
the
presence
of
the
king
this
blow
staggered
hendon
to
his
foundations
he
muttered
to
himself
lo
the
poor
thing
s
madness
is
up
with
the
time
it
hath
changed
with
the
great
change
that
is
come
to
the
realm
and
now
in
fancy
is
he
king
good
lack
i
must
humour
the
conceit
too
there
is
no
other
way
faith
he
would
order
me
to
the
tower
else
and
pleased
with
this
jest
he
removed
the
chair
from
the
table
took
his
stand
behind
the
king
and
proceeded
to
wait
upon
him
in
the
courtliest
way
he
was
capable
of
while
the
king
ate
the
rigour
of
his
royal
dignity
relaxed
a
little
and
with
his
growing
contentment
came
a
desire
to
talk
he
said
i
think
thou
callest
thyself
miles
hendon
if
i
heard
thee
aright
yes
sire
miles
replied
then
observed
to
himself
if
i
must
humour
the
poor
lad
s
madness
i
must
sire
him
i
must
majesty
him
i
must
not
go
by
halves
i
must
stick
at
nothing
that
belongeth
to
the
part
i
play
else
shall
i
play
it
ill
and
work
evil
to
this
charitable
and
kindly
cause
the
king
warmed
his
heart
with
a
second
glass
of
wine
and
said
i
would
know
thee
tell
me
thy
story
thou
hast
a
gallant
way
with
thee
and
a
noble
art
nobly
born
we
are
of
the
tail
of
the
nobility
good
your
majesty

sir
richard
hendon
of
hendon
hall
by
monk
s
holm
in
kent
the
name
has
escaped
my
memory
go
on
tell
me
thy
story
tis
not
much
your
majesty
yet
perchance
it
may
beguile
a
short
half
hour
for
want
of
a
better
my
father
sir
richard
is
very
rich
and
of
a
most
generous
nature
my
mother
died
whilst
i
was
yet
a
boy
i
have
two
brothers
arthur
my
elder
with
a
soul
like
to
his
father
s
and
hugh
younger
than
i
a
mean
spirit
covetous
treacherous
vicious
underhanded
a
reptile
such
was
he
from
the
cradle
such
was
he
ten
years
past
when
i
last
saw
him
a
ripe
rascal
at
nineteen
i
being
twenty
then
and
arthur
twenty
two
there
is
none
other
of
us
but
the
lady
edith
my
cousin
she
was
sixteen
then
beautiful
gentle
good
the
daughter
of
an
earl
the
last
of
her
race
heiress
of
a
great
fortune
and
a
lapsed
title
my
father
was
her
guardian
i
loved
her
and
she
loved
me
but
she
was
betrothed
to
arthur
from
the
cradle
and
sir
richard
would
not
suffer
the
contract
to
be
broken
arthur
loved
another
maid
and
bade
us
be
of
good
cheer
and
hold
fast
to
the
hope
that
delay
and
luck
together
would
some
day
give
success
to
our
several
causes
hugh
loved
the
lady
edith
s
fortune
though
in
truth
he
said
it
was
herself
he
loved
but
then
twas
his
way
alway
to
say
the
one
thing
and
mean
the
other
but
he
lost
his
arts
upon
the
girl
he
could
deceive
my
father
but
none
else
my
father
loved
him
best
of
us
all
and
trusted
and
believed
him
for
he
was
the
youngest
child
and
others
hated
him
these
qualities
being
in
all
ages
sufficient
to
win
a
parent
s
dearest
love
and
he
had
a
smooth
persuasive
tongue
with
an
admirable
gift
of
lying
and
these
be
qualities
which
do
mightily
assist
a
blind
affection
to
cozen
itself
i
was
wild
in
troth
i
might
go
yet
farther
and
say
very
wild
though
twas
a
wildness
of
an
innocent
sort
since
it
hurt
none
but
me
brought
shame
to
none
nor
loss
nor
had
in
it
any
taint
of
crime
or
baseness
or
what
might
not
beseem
mine
honourable
degree
yet
did
my
brother
hugh
turn
these
faults
to
good
account
he
seeing
that
our
brother
arthur
s
health
was
but
indifferent
and
hoping
the
worst
might
work
him
profit
were
i
swept
out
of
the
path
so
but
twere
a
long
tale
good
my
liege
and
little
worth
the
telling
briefly
then
this
brother
did
deftly
magnify
my
faults
and
make
them
crimes
ending
his
base
work
with
finding
a
silken
ladder
in
mine
apartments
conveyed
thither
by
his
own
means
and
did
convince
my
father
by
this
and
suborned
evidence
of
servants
and
other
lying
knaves
that
i
was
minded
to
carry
off
my
edith
and
marry
with
her
in
rank
defiance
of
his
will
three
years
of
banishment
from
home
and
england
might
make
a
soldier
and
a
man
of
me
my
father
said
and
teach
me
some
degree
of
wisdom
i
fought
out
my
long
probation
in
the
continental
wars
tasting
sumptuously
of
hard
knocks
privation
and
adventure
but
in
my
last
battle
i
was
taken
captive
and
during
the
seven
years
that
have
waxed
and
waned
since
then
a
foreign
dungeon
hath
harboured
me
through
wit
and
courage
i
won
to
the
free
air
at
last
and
fled
hither
straight
and
am
but
just
arrived
right
poor
in
purse
and
raiment
and
poorer
still
in
knowledge
of
what
these
dull
seven
years
have
wrought
at
hendon
hall
its
people
and
belongings
so
please
you
sir
my
meagre
tale
is
told
thou
hast
been
shamefully
abused
said
the
little
king
with
a
flashing
eye
but
i
will
right
thee
by
the
cross
will
i
the
king
hath
said
it
then
fired
by
the
story
of
miles
s
wrongs
he
loosed
his
tongue
and
poured
the
history
of
his
own
recent
misfortunes
into
the
ears
of
his
astonished
listener
when
he
had
finished
miles
said
to
himself
lo
what
an
imagination
he
hath
verily
this
is
no
common
mind
else
crazed
or
sane
it
could
not
weave
so
straight
and
gaudy
a
tale
as
this
out
of
the
airy
nothings
wherewith
it
hath
wrought
this
curious
romaunt
poor
ruined
little
head
it
shall
not
lack
friend
or
shelter
whilst
i
bide
with
the
living
he
shall
never
leave
my
side
he
shall
be
my
pet
my
little
comrade
and
he
shall
be
cured
ay
made
whole
and
sound
then
will
he
make
himself
a
name
and
proud
shall
i
be
to
say
yes
he
is
mine
i
took
him
a
homeless
little
ragamuffin
but
i
saw
what
was
in
him
and
i
said
his
name
would
be
heard
some
day
behold
him
observe
him
was
i
right
the
king
spoke
in
a
thoughtful
measured
voice
thou
didst
save
me
injury
and
shame
perchance
my
life
and
so
my
crown
such
service
demandeth
rich
reward
name
thy
desire
and
so
it
be
within
the
compass
of
my
royal
power
it
is
thine
this
fantastic
suggestion
startled
hendon
out
of
his
reverie
he
was
about
to
thank
the
king
and
put
the
matter
aside
with
saying
he
had
only
done
his
duty
and
desired
no
reward
but
a
wiser
thought
came
into
his
head
and
he
asked
leave
to
be
silent
a
few
moments
and
consider
the
gracious
offer
an
idea
which
the
king
gravely
approved
remarking
that
it
was
best
to
be
not
too
hasty
with
a
thing
of
such
great
import
miles
reflected
during
some
moments
then
said
to
himself
yes
that
is
the
thing
to
do
by
any
other
means
it
were
impossible
to
get
at
it
and
certes
this
hour
s
experience
has
taught
me
twould
be
most
wearing
and
inconvenient
to
continue
it
as
it
is
yes
i
will
propose
it
twas
a
happy
accident
that
i
did
not
throw
the
chance
away
then
he
dropped
upon
one
knee
and
said
my
poor
service
went
not
beyond
the
limit
of
a
subject
s
simple
duty
and
therefore
hath
no
merit
but
since
your
majesty
is
pleased
to
hold
it
worthy
some
reward
i
take
heart
of
grace
to
make
petition
to
this
effect
near
four
hundred
years
ago
as
your
grace
knoweth
there
being
ill
blood
betwixt
john
king
of
england
and
the
king
of
france
it
was
decreed
that
two
champions
should
fight
together
in
the
lists
and
so
settle
the
dispute
by
what
is
called
the
arbitrament
of
god
these
two
kings
and
the
spanish
king
being
assembled
to
witness
and
judge
the
conflict
the
french
champion
appeared
but
so
redoubtable
was
he
that
our
english
knights
refused
to
measure
weapons
with
him
so
the
matter
which
was
a
weighty
one
was
like
to
go
against
the
english
monarch
by
default
now
in
the
tower
lay
the
lord
de
courcy
the
mightiest
arm
in
england
stripped
of
his
honours
and
possessions
and
wasting
with
long
captivity
appeal
was
made
to
him
he
gave
assent
and
came
forth
arrayed
for
battle
but
no
sooner
did
the
frenchman
glimpse
his
huge
frame
and
hear
his
famous
name
but
he
fled
away
and
the
french
king
s
cause
was
lost
king
john
restored
de
courcy
s
titles
and
possessions
and
said
name
thy
wish
and
thou
shalt
have
it
though
it
cost
me
half
my
kingdom
whereat
de
courcy
kneeling
as
i
do
now
made
answer
this
then
i
ask
my
liege
that
i
and
my
successors
may
have
and
hold
the
privilege
of
remaining
covered
in
the
presence
of
the
kings
of
england
henceforth
while
the
throne
shall
last
the
boon
was
granted
as
your
majesty
knoweth
and
there
hath
been
no
time
these
four
hundred
years
that
that
line
has
failed
of
an
heir
and
so
even
unto
this
day
the
head
of
that
ancient
house
still
weareth
his
hat
or
helm
before
the
