s
preface
a
few
words
about
dostoevsky
himself
may
help
the
english
reader
to
understand
his
work
dostoevsky
was
the
son
of
a
doctor
his
parents
were
very
hard
working
and
deeply
religious
people
but
so
poor
that
they
lived
with
their
five
children
in
only
two
rooms
the
father
and
mother
spent
their
evenings
in
reading
aloud
to
their
children
generally
from
books
of
a
serious
character
though
always
sickly
and
delicate
dostoevsky
came
out
third
in
the
final
examination
of
the
petersburg
school
of
engineering
there
he
had
already
begun
his
first
work
poor
folk
this
story
was
published
by
the
poet
nekrassov
in
his
review
and
was
received
with
acclamations
the
shy
unknown
youth
found
himself
instantly
something
of
a
celebrity
a
brilliant
and
successful
career
seemed
to
open
before
him
but
those
hopes
were
soon
dashed
in
1849
he
was
arrested
though
neither
by
temperament
nor
conviction
a
revolutionist
dostoevsky
was
one
of
a
little
group
of
young
men
who
met
together
to
read
fourier
and
proudhon
he
was
accused
of
taking
part
in
conversations
against
the
censorship
of
reading
a
letter
from
byelinsky
to
gogol
and
of
knowing
of
the
intention
to
set
up
a
printing
press
under
nicholas
i
that
stern
and
just
man
as
maurice
baring
calls
him
this
was
enough
and
he
was
condemned
to
death
after
eight
months
imprisonment
he
was
with
twenty
one
others
taken
out
to
the
semyonovsky
square
to
be
shot
writing
to
his
brother
mihail
dostoevsky
says
they
snapped
words
over
our
heads
and
they
made
us
put
on
the
white
shirts
worn
by
persons
condemned
to
death
thereupon
we
were
bound
in
threes
to
stakes
to
suffer
execution
being
the
third
in
the
row
i
concluded
i
had
only
a
few
minutes
of
life
before
me
i
thought
of
you
and
your
dear
ones
and
i
contrived
to
kiss
plestcheiev
and
dourov
who
were
next
to
me
and
to
bid
them
farewell
suddenly
the
troops
beat
a
tattoo
we
were
unbound
brought
back
upon
the
scaffold
and
informed
that
his
majesty
had
spared
us
our
lives
the
sentence
was
commuted
to
hard
labour
one
of
the
prisoners
grigoryev
went
mad
as
soon
as
he
was
untied
and
never
regained
his
sanity
the
intense
suffering
of
this
experience
left
a
lasting
stamp
on
dostoevsky
s
mind
though
his
religious
temper
led
him
in
the
end
to
accept
every
suffering
with
resignation
and
to
regard
it
as
a
blessing
in
his
own
case
he
constantly
recurs
to
the
subject
in
his
writings
he
describes
the
awful
agony
of
the
condemned
man
and
insists
on
the
cruelty
of
inflicting
such
torture
then
followed
four
years
of
penal
servitude
spent
in
the
company
of
common
criminals
in
siberia
where
he
began
the
dead
house
and
some
years
of
service
in
a
disciplinary
battalion
he
had
shown
signs
of
some
obscure
nervous
disease
before
his
arrest
and
this
now
developed
into
violent
attacks
of
epilepsy
from
which
he
suffered
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
fits
occurred
three
or
four
times
a
year
and
were
more
frequent
in
periods
of
great
strain
in
1859
he
was
allowed
to
return
to
russia
he
started
a
journal
vremya
which
was
forbidden
by
the
censorship
through
a
misunderstanding
in
1864
he
lost
his
first
wife
and
his
brother
mihail
he
was
in
terrible
poverty
yet
he
took
upon
himself
the
payment
of
his
brother
s
debts
he
started
another
journal
the
epoch
which
within
a
few
months
was
also
prohibited
he
was
weighed
down
by
debt
his
brother
s
family
was
dependent
on
him
he
was
forced
to
write
at
heart
breaking
speed
and
is
said
never
to
have
corrected
his
work
the
later
years
of
his
life
were
much
softened
by
the
tenderness
and
devotion
of
his
second
wife
in
june
1880
he
made
his
famous
speech
at
the
unveiling
of
the
monument
to
pushkin
in
moscow
and
he
was
received
with
extraordinary
demonstrations
of
love
and
honour
a
few
months
later
dostoevsky
died
he
was
followed
to
the
grave
by
a
vast
multitude
of
mourners
who
gave
the
hapless
man
the
funeral
of
a
king
he
is
still
probably
the
most
widely
read
writer
in
russia
in
the
words
of
a
russian
critic
who
seeks
to
explain
the
feeling
inspired
by
dostoevsky
he
was
one
of
ourselves
a
man
of
our
blood
and
our
bone
but
one
who
has
suffered
and
has
seen
so
much
more
deeply
than
we
have
his
insight
impresses
us
as
wisdom
that
wisdom
of
the
heart
which
we
seek
that
we
may
learn
from
it
how
to
live
all
his
other
gifts
came
to
him
from
nature
this
he
won
for
himself
and
through
it
he
became
great
crime
and
punishment
part
i
chapter
i
on
an
exceptionally
hot
evening
early
in
july
a
young
man
came
out
of
the
garret
in
which
he
lodged
in
s
place
and
walked
slowly
as
though
in
hesitation
towards
k
bridge
he
had
successfully
avoided
meeting
his
landlady
on
the
staircase
his
garret
was
under
the
roof
of
a
high
five
storied
house
and
was
more
like
a
cupboard
than
a
room
the
landlady
who
provided
him
with
garret
dinners
and
attendance
lived
on
the
floor
below
and
every
time
he
went
out
he
was
obliged
to
pass
her
kitchen
the
door
of
which
invariably
stood
open
and
each
time
he
passed
the
young
man
had
a
sick
frightened
feeling
which
made
him
scowl
and
feel
ashamed
he
was
hopelessly
in
debt
to
his
landlady
and
was
afraid
of
meeting
her
this
was
not
because
he
was
cowardly
and
abject
quite
the
contrary
but
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
in
an
overstrained
irritable
condition
verging
on
hypochondria
he
had
become
so
completely
absorbed
in
himself
and
isolated
from
his
fellows
that
he
dreaded
meeting
not
only
his
landlady
but
anyone
at
all
he
was
crushed
by
poverty
but
the
anxieties
of
his
position
had
of
late
ceased
to
weigh
upon
him
he
had
given
up
attending
to
matters
of
practical
importance
he
had
lost
all
desire
to
do
so
nothing
that
any
landlady
could
do
had
a
real
terror
for
him
but
to
be
stopped
on
the
stairs
to
be
forced
to
listen
to
her
trivial
irrelevant
gossip
to
pestering
demands
for
payment
threats
and
complaints
and
to
rack
his
brains
for
excuses
to
prevaricate
to
lie
no
rather
than
that
he
would
creep
down
the
stairs
like
a
cat
and
slip
out
unseen
this
evening
however
on
coming
out
into
the
street
he
became
acutely
aware
of
his
fears
i
want
to
attempt
a
thing
like
that
and
am
frightened
by
these
trifles
he
thought
with
an
odd
smile
hm
yes
all
is
in
a
man
s
hands
and
he
lets
it
all
slip
from
cowardice
that
s
an
axiom
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
it
is
men
are
most
afraid
of
taking
a
new
step
uttering
a
new
word
is
what
they
fear
most
but
i
am
talking
too
much
it
s
because
i
chatter
that
i
do
nothing
or
perhaps
it
is
that
i
chatter
because
i
do
nothing
i
ve
learned
to
chatter
this
last
month
lying
for
days
together
in
my
den
thinking
of
jack
the
giant
killer
why
am
i
going
there
now
am
i
capable
of
that
is
that
serious
it
is
not
serious
at
all
it
s
simply
a
fantasy
to
amuse
myself
a
plaything
yes
maybe
it
is
a
plaything
the
heat
in
the
street
was
terrible
and
the
airlessness
the
bustle
and
the
plaster
scaffolding
bricks
and
dust
all
about
him
and
that
special
petersburg
stench
so
familiar
to
all
who
are
unable
to
get
out
of
town
in
summer
all
worked
painfully
upon
the
young
man
s
already
overwrought
nerves
the
insufferable
stench
from
the
pot
houses
which
are
particularly
numerous
in
that
part
of
the
town
and
the
drunken
men
whom
he
met
continually
although
it
was
a
working
day
completed
the
revolting
misery
of
the
picture
an
expression
of
the
profoundest
disgust
gleamed
for
a
moment
in
the
young
man
s
refined
face
he
was
by
the
way
exceptionally
handsome
above
the
average
in
height
slim
well
built
with
beautiful
dark
eyes
and
dark
brown
hair
soon
he
sank
into
deep
thought
or
more
accurately
speaking
into
a
complete
blankness
of
mind
he
walked
along
not
observing
what
was
about
him
and
not
caring
to
observe
it
from
time
to
time
he
would
mutter
something
from
the
habit
of
talking
to
himself
to
which
he
had
just
confessed
at
these
moments
he
would
become
conscious
that
his
ideas
were
sometimes
in
a
tangle
and
that
he
was
very
weak
for
two
days
he
had
scarcely
tasted
food
he
was
so
badly
dressed
that
even
a
man
accustomed
to
shabbiness
would
have
been
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
the
street
in
such
rags
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
however
scarcely
any
shortcoming
in
dress
would
have
created
surprise
owing
to
the
proximity
of
the
hay
market
the
number
of
establishments
of
bad
character
the
preponderance
of
the
trading
and
working
class
population
crowded
in
these
streets
and
alleys
in
the
heart
of
petersburg
types
so
various
were
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
that
no
figure
however
queer
would
have
caused
surprise
but
there
was
such
accumulated
bitterness
and
contempt
in
the
young
man
s
heart
that
in
spite
of
all
the
fastidiousness
of
youth
he
minded
his
rags
least
of
all
in
the
street
it
was
a
different
matter
when
he
met
with
acquaintances
or
with
former
fellow
students
whom
indeed
he
disliked
meeting
at
any
time
and
yet
when
a
drunken
man
who
for
some
unknown
reason
was
being
taken
somewhere
in
a
huge
waggon
dragged
by
a
heavy
dray
horse
suddenly
shouted
at
him
as
he
drove
past
hey
there
german
hatter
bawling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
pointing
at
him
the
young
man
stopped
suddenly
and
clutched
tremulously
at
his
hat
it
was
a
tall
round
hat
from
zimmerman
s
but
completely
worn
out
rusty
with
age
all
torn
and
bespattered
brimless
and
bent
on
one
side
in
a
most
unseemly
fashion
not
shame
however
but
quite
another
feeling
akin
to
terror
had
overtaken
him
i
knew
it
he
muttered
in
confusion
i
thought
so
that
s
the
worst
of
all
why
a
stupid
thing
like
this
the
most
trivial
detail
might
spoil
the
whole
plan
yes
my
hat
is
too
noticeable
it
looks
absurd
and
that
makes
it
noticeable
with
my
rags
i
ought
to
wear
a
cap
any
sort
of
old
pancake
but
not
this
grotesque
thing
nobody
wears
such
a
hat
it
would
be
noticed
a
mile
off
it
would
be
remembered
what
matters
is
that
people
would
remember
it
and
that
would
give
them
a
clue
for
this
business
one
should
be
as
little
conspicuous
as
possible
trifles
trifles
are
what
matter
why
it
s
just
such
trifles
that
always
ruin
everything
he
had
not
far
to
go
he
knew
indeed
how
many
steps
it
was
from
the
gate
of
his
lodging
house
exactly
seven
hundred
and
thirty
he
had
counted
them
once
when
he
had
been
lost
in
dreams
at
the
time
he
had
put
no
faith
in
those
dreams
and
was
only
tantalising
himself
by
their
hideous
but
daring
recklessness
now
a
month
later
he
had
begun
to
look
upon
them
differently
and
in
spite
of
the
monologues
in
which
he
jeered
at
his
own
impotence
and
indecision
he
had
involuntarily
come
to
regard
this
hideous
dream
as
an
exploit
to
be
attempted
although
he
still
did
not
realise
this
himself
he
was
positively
going
now
for
a
rehearsal
of
his
project
and
at
every
step
his
excitement
grew
more
and
more
violent
with
a
sinking
heart
and
a
nervous
tremor
he
went
up
to
a
huge
house
which
on
one
side
looked
on
to
the
canal
and
on
the
other
into
the
street
this
house
was
let
out
in
tiny
tenements
and
was
inhabited
by
working
people
of
all
kinds
tailors
locksmiths
cooks
germans
of
sorts
girls
picking
up
a
living
as
best
they
could
petty
clerks
etc
there
was
a
continual
coming
and
going
through
the
two
gates
and
in
the
two
courtyards
of
the
house
three
or
four
door
keepers
were
employed
on
the
building
the
young
man
was
very
glad
to
meet
none
of
them
and
at
once
slipped
unnoticed
through
the
door
on
the
right
and
up
the
staircase
it
was
a
back
staircase
dark
and
narrow
but
he
was
familiar
with
it
already
and
knew
his
way
and
he
liked
all
these
surroundings
in
such
darkness
even
the
most
inquisitive
eyes
were
not
to
be
dreaded
if
i
am
so
scared
now
what
would
it
be
if
it
somehow
came
to
pass
that
i
were
really
going
to
do
it
he
could
not
help
asking
himself
as
he
reached
the
fourth
storey
there
his
progress
was
barred
by
some
porters
who
were
engaged
in
moving
furniture
out
of
a
flat
he
knew
that
the
flat
had
been
occupied
by
a
german
clerk
in
the
civil
service
and
his
family
this
german
was
moving
out
then
and
so
the
fourth
floor
on
this
staircase
would
be
untenanted
except
by
the
old
woman
that
s
a
good
thing
anyway
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
rang
the
bell
of
the
old
woman
s
flat
the
bell
gave
a
faint
tinkle
as
though
it
were
made
of
tin
and
not
of
copper
the
little
flats
in
such
houses
always
have
bells
that
ring
like
that
he
had
forgotten
the
note
of
that
bell
and
now
its
peculiar
tinkle
seemed
to
remind
him
of
something
and
to
bring
it
clearly
before
him
he
started
his
nerves
were
terribly
overstrained
by
now
in
a
little
while
the
door
was
opened
a
tiny
crack
the
old
woman
eyed
her
visitor
with
evident
distrust
through
the
crack
and
nothing
could
be
seen
but
her
little
eyes
glittering
in
the
darkness
but
seeing
a
number
of
people
on
the
landing
she
grew
bolder
and
opened
the
door
wide
the
young
man
stepped
into
the
dark
entry
which
was
partitioned
off
from
the
tiny
kitchen
the
old
woman
stood
facing
him
in
silence
and
looking
inquiringly
at
him
she
was
a
diminutive
withered
up
old
woman
of
sixty
with
sharp
malignant
eyes
and
a
sharp
little
nose
her
colourless
somewhat
grizzled
hair
was
thickly
smeared
with
oil
and
she
wore
no
kerchief
over
it
round
her
thin
long
neck
which
looked
like
a
hen
s
leg
was
knotted
some
sort
of
flannel
rag
and
in
spite
of
the
heat
there
hung
flapping
on
her
shoulders
a
mangy
fur
cape
yellow
with
age
the
old
woman
coughed
and
groaned
at
every
instant
the
young
man
must
have
looked
at
her
with
a
rather
peculiar
expression
for
a
gleam
of
mistrust
came
into
her
eyes
again
raskolnikov
a
student
i
came
here
a
month
ago
the
young
man
made
haste
to
mutter
with
a
half
bow
remembering
that
he
ought
to
be
more
polite
i
remember
my
good
sir
i
remember
quite
well
your
coming
here
the
old
woman
said
distinctly
still
keeping
her
inquiring
eyes
on
his
face
and
here
i
am
again
on
the
same
errand
raskolnikov
continued
a
little
disconcerted
and
surprised
at
the
old
woman
s
mistrust
perhaps
she
is
always
like
that
though
only
i
did
not
notice
it
the
other
time
he
thought
with
an
uneasy
feeling
the
old
woman
paused
as
though
hesitating
then
stepped
on
one
side
and
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
room
she
said
letting
her
visitor
pass
in
front
of
her
step
in
my
good
sir
the
little
room
into
which
the
young
man
walked
with
yellow
paper
on
the
walls
geraniums
and
muslin
curtains
in
the
windows
was
brightly
lighted
up
at
that
moment
by
the
setting
sun
so
the
sun
will
shine
like
this
then
too
flashed
as
it
were
by
chance
through
raskolnikov
s
mind
and
with
a
rapid
glance
he
scanned
everything
in
the
room
trying
as
far
as
possible
to
notice
and
remember
its
arrangement
but
there
was
nothing
special
in
the
room
the
furniture
all
very
old
and
of
yellow
wood
consisted
of
a
sofa
with
a
huge
bent
wooden
back
an
oval
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
a
dressing
table
with
a
looking
glass
fixed
on
it
between
the
windows
chairs
along
the
walls
and
two
or
three
half
penny
prints
in
yellow
frames
representing
german
damsels
with
birds
in
their
hands
that
was
all
in
the
corner
a
light
was
burning
before
a
small
ikon
everything
was
very
clean
the
floor
and
the
furniture
were
brightly
polished
everything
shone
lizaveta
s
work
thought
the
young
man
there
was
not
a
speck
of
dust
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
flat
it
s
in
the
houses
of
spiteful
old
widows
that
one
finds
such
cleanliness
raskolnikov
thought
again
and
he
stole
a
curious
glance
at
the
cotton
curtain
over
the
door
leading
into
another
tiny
room
in
which
stood
the
old
woman
s
bed
and
chest
of
drawers
and
into
which
he
had
never
looked
before
these
two
rooms
made
up
the
whole
flat
what
do
you
want
the
old
woman
said
severely
coming
into
the
room
and
as
before
standing
in
front
of
him
so
as
to
look
him
straight
in
the
face
i
ve
brought
something
to
pawn
here
and
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
an
old
fashioned
flat
silver
watch
on
the
back
of
which
was
engraved
a
globe
the
chain
was
of
steel
but
the
time
is
up
for
your
last
pledge
the
month
was
up
the
day
before
yesterday
i
will
bring
you
the
interest
for
another
month
wait
a
little
but
that
s
for
me
to
do
as
i
please
my
good
sir
to
wait
or
to
sell
your
pledge
at
once
how
much
will
you
give
me
for
the
watch
alyona
ivanovna
you
come
with
such
trifles
my
good
sir
it
s
scarcely
worth
anything
i
gave
you
two
roubles
last
time
for
your
ring
and
one
could
buy
it
quite
new
at
a
jeweler
s
for
a
rouble
and
a
half
give
me
four
roubles
for
it
i
shall
redeem
it
it
was
my
father
s
i
shall
be
getting
some
money
soon
a
rouble
and
a
half
and
interest
in
advance
if
you
like
a
rouble
and
a
half
cried
the
young
man
please
yourself
and
the
old
woman
handed
him
back
the
watch
the
young
man
took
it
and
was
so
angry
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
but
checked
himself
at
once
remembering
that
there
was
nowhere
else
he
could
go
and
that
he
had
had
another
object
also
in
coming
hand
it
over
he
said
roughly
the
old
woman
fumbled
in
her
pocket
for
her
keys
and
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
into
the
other
room
the
young
man
left
standing
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
listened
inquisitively
thinking
he
could
hear
her
unlocking
the
chest
of
drawers
it
must
be
the
top
drawer
he
reflected
so
she
carries
the
keys
in
a
pocket
on
the
right
all
in
one
bunch
on
a
steel
ring
and
there
s
one
key
there
three
times
as
big
as
all
the
others
with
deep
notches
that
can
t
be
the
key
of
the
chest
of
drawers
then
there
must
be
some
other
chest
or
strong
box
that
s
worth
knowing
strong
boxes
always
have
keys
like
that
but
how
degrading
it
all
is
the
old
woman
came
back
here
sir
as
we
say
ten
copecks
the
rouble
a
month
so
i
must
take
fifteen
copecks
from
a
rouble
and
a
half
for
the
month
in
advance
but
for
the
two
roubles
i
lent
you
before
you
owe
me
now
twenty
copecks
on
the
same
reckoning
in
advance
that
makes
thirty
five
copecks
altogether
so
i
must
give
you
a
rouble
and
fifteen
copecks
for
the
watch
here
it
is
what
only
a
rouble
and
fifteen
copecks
now
just
so
the
young
man
did
not
dispute
it
and
took
the
money
he
looked
at
the
old
woman
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
get
away
as
though
there
was
still
something
he
wanted
to
say
or
to
do
but
he
did
not
himself
quite
know
what
i
may
be
bringing
you
something
else
in
a
day
or
two
alyona
ivanovna
a
valuable
thing
silver
a
cigarette
box
as
soon
as
i
get
it
back
from
a
friend
he
broke
off
in
confusion
well
we
will
talk
about
it
then
sir
good
bye
are
you
always
at
home
alone
your
sister
is
not
here
with
you
he
asked
her
as
casually
as
possible
as
he
went
out
into
the
passage
what
business
is
she
of
yours
my
good
sir
oh
nothing
particular
i
simply
asked
you
are
too
quick
good
day
alyona
ivanovna
raskolnikov
went
out
in
complete
confusion
this
confusion
became
more
and
more
intense
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
he
even
stopped
short
two
or
three
times
as
though
suddenly
struck
by
some
thought
when
he
was
in
the
street
he
cried
out
oh
god
how
loathsome
it
all
is
and
can
i
can
i
possibly
no
it
s
nonsense
it
s
rubbish
he
added
resolutely
and
how
could
such
an
atrocious
thing
come
into
my
head
what
filthy
things
my
heart
is
capable
of
yes
filthy
above
all
disgusting
loathsome
loathsome
and
for
a
whole
month
i
ve
been
but
no
words
no
exclamations
could
express
his
agitation
the
feeling
of
intense
repulsion
which
had
begun
to
oppress
and
torture
his
heart
while
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
old
woman
had
by
now
reached
such
a
pitch
and
had
taken
such
a
definite
form
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
to
escape
from
his
wretchedness
he
walked
along
the
pavement
like
a
drunken
man
regardless
of
the
passers
by
and
jostling
against
them
and
only
came
to
his
senses
when
he
was
in
the
next
street
looking
round
he
noticed
that
he
was
standing
close
to
a
tavern
which
was
entered
by
steps
leading
from
the
pavement
to
the
basement
at
that
instant
two
drunken
men
came
out
at
the
door
and
abusing
and
supporting
one
another
they
mounted
the
steps
without
stopping
to
think
raskolnikov
went
down
the
steps
at
once
till
that
moment
he
had
never
been
into
a
tavern
but
now
he
felt
giddy
and
was
tormented
by
a
burning
thirst
he
longed
for
a
drink
of
cold
beer
and
attributed
his
sudden
weakness
to
the
want
of
food
he
sat
down
at
a
sticky
little
table
in
a
dark
and
dirty
corner
ordered
some
beer
and
eagerly
drank
off
the
first
glassful
at
once
he
felt
easier
and
his
thoughts
became
clear
all
that
s
nonsense
he
said
hopefully
and
there
is
nothing
in
it
all
to
worry
about
it
s
simply
physical
derangement
just
a
glass
of
beer
a
piece
of
dry
bread
and
in
one
moment
the
brain
is
stronger
the
mind
is
clearer
and
the
will
is
firm
phew
how
utterly
petty
it
all
is
but
in
spite
of
this
scornful
reflection
he
was
by
now
looking
cheerful
as
though
he
were
suddenly
set
free
from
a
terrible
burden
and
he
gazed
round
in
a
friendly
way
at
the
people
in
the
room
but
even
at
that
moment
he
had
a
dim
foreboding
that
this
happier
frame
of
mind
was
also
not
normal
there
were
few
people
at
the
time
in
the
tavern
besides
the
two
drunken
men
he
had
met
on
the
steps
a
group
consisting
of
about
five
men
and
a
girl
with
a
concertina
had
gone
out
at
the
same
time
their
departure
left
the
room
quiet
and
rather
empty
the
persons
still
in
the
tavern
were
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
an
artisan
drunk
but
not
extremely
so
sitting
before
a
pot
of
beer
and
his
companion
a
huge
stout
man
with
a
grey
beard
in
a
short
full
skirted
coat
he
was
very
drunk
and
had
dropped
asleep
on
the
bench
every
now
and
then
he
began
as
though
in
his
sleep
cracking
his
fingers
with
his
arms
wide
apart
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
bounding
about
on
the
bench
while
he
hummed
some
meaningless
refrain
trying
to
recall
some
such
lines
as
these
his
wife
a
year
he
fondly
loved
his
wife
a
a
year
he
fondly
loved
or
suddenly
waking
up
again
walking
along
the
crowded
row
he
met
the
one
he
used
to
know
but
no
one
shared
his
enjoyment
his
silent
companion
looked
with
positive
hostility
and
mistrust
at
all
these
manifestations
there
was
another
man
in
the
room
who
looked
somewhat
like
a
retired
government
clerk
he
was
sitting
apart
now
and
then
sipping
from
his
pot
and
looking
round
at
the
company
he
too
appeared
to
be
in
some
agitation
chapter
ii
raskolnikov
was
not
used
to
crowds
and
as
we
said
before
he
avoided
society
of
every
sort
more
especially
of
late
but
now
all
at
once
he
felt
a
desire
to
be
with
other
people
something
new
seemed
to
be
taking
place
within
him
and
with
it
he
felt
a
sort
of
thirst
for
company
he
was
so
weary
after
a
whole
month
of
concentrated
wretchedness
and
gloomy
excitement
that
he
longed
to
rest
if
only
for
a
moment
in
some
other
world
whatever
it
might
be
and
in
spite
of
the
filthiness
of
the
surroundings
he
was
glad
now
to
stay
in
the
tavern
the
master
of
the
establishment
was
in
another
room
but
he
frequently
came
down
some
steps
into
the
main
room
his
jaunty
tarred
boots
with
red
turn
over
tops
coming
into
view
each
time
before
the
rest
of
his
person
he
wore
a
full
coat
and
a
horribly
greasy
black
satin
waistcoat
with
no
cravat
and
his
whole
face
seemed
smeared
with
oil
like
an
iron
lock
at
the
counter
stood
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
and
there
was
another
boy
somewhat
younger
who
handed
whatever
was
wanted
on
the
counter
lay
some
sliced
cucumber
some
pieces
of
dried
black
bread
and
some
fish
chopped
up
small
all
smelling
very
bad
it
was
insufferably
close
and
so
heavy
with
the
fumes
of
spirits
that
five
minutes
in
such
an
atmosphere
might
well
make
a
man
drunk
there
are
chance
meetings
with
strangers
that
interest
us
from
the
first
moment
before
a
word
is
spoken
such
was
the
impression
made
on
raskolnikov
by
the
person
sitting
a
little
distance
from
him
who
looked
like
a
retired
clerk
the
young
man
often
recalled
this
impression
afterwards
and
even
ascribed
it
to
presentiment
he
looked
repeatedly
at
the
clerk
partly
no
doubt
because
the
latter
was
staring
persistently
at
him
obviously
anxious
to
enter
into
conversation
at
the
other
persons
in
the
room
including
the
tavern
keeper
the
clerk
looked
as
though
he
were
used
to
their
company
and
weary
of
it
showing
a
shade
of
condescending
contempt
for
them
as
persons
of
station
and
culture
inferior
to
his
own
with
whom
it
would
be
useless
for
him
to
converse
he
was
a
man
over
fifty
bald
and
grizzled
of
medium
height
and
stoutly
built
his
face
bloated
from
continual
drinking
was
of
a
yellow
even
greenish
tinge
with
swollen
eyelids
out
of
which
keen
reddish
eyes
gleamed
like
little
chinks
but
there
was
something
very
strange
in
him
there
was
a
light
in
his
eyes
as
though
of
intense
feeling
perhaps
there
were
even
thought
and
intelligence
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
gleam
of
something
like
madness
he
was
wearing
an
old
and
hopelessly
ragged
black
dress
coat
with
all
its
buttons
missing
except
one
and
that
one
he
had
buttoned
evidently
clinging
to
this
last
trace
of
respectability
a
crumpled
shirt
front
covered
with
spots
and
stains
protruded
from
his
canvas
waistcoat
like
a
clerk
he
wore
no
beard
nor
moustache
but
had
been
so
long
unshaven
that
his
chin
looked
like
a
stiff
greyish
brush
and
there
was
something
respectable
and
like
an
official
about
his
manner
too
but
he
was
restless
he
ruffled
up
his
hair
and
from
time
to
time
let
his
head
drop
into
his
hands
dejectedly
resting
his
ragged
elbows
on
the
stained
and
sticky
table
at
last
he
looked
straight
at
raskolnikov
and
said
loudly
and
resolutely
may
i
venture
honoured
sir
to
engage
you
in
polite
conversation
forasmuch
as
though
your
exterior
would
not
command
respect
my
experience
admonishes
me
that
you
are
a
man
of
education
and
not
accustomed
to
drinking
i
have
always
respected
education
when
in
conjunction
with
genuine
sentiments
and
i
am
besides
a
titular
counsellor
in
rank
marmeladov
such
is
my
name
titular
counsellor
i
make
bold
to
inquire
have
you
been
in
the
service
no
i
am
studying
answered
the
young
man
somewhat
surprised
at
the
grandiloquent
style
of
the
speaker
and
also
at
being
so
directly
addressed
in
spite
of
the
momentary
desire
he
had
just
been
feeling
for
company
of
any
sort
on
being
actually
spoken
to
he
felt
immediately
his
habitual
irritable
and
uneasy
aversion
for
any
stranger
who
approached
or
attempted
to
approach
him
a
student
then
or
formerly
a
student
cried
the
clerk
just
what
i
thought
i
m
a
man
of
experience
immense
experience
sir
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
with
his
fingers
in
self
approval
you
ve
been
a
student
or
have
attended
some
learned
institution
but
allow
me
he
got
up
staggered
took
up
his
jug
and
glass
and
sat
down
beside
the
young
man
facing
him
a
little
sideways
he
was
drunk
but
spoke
fluently
and
boldly
only
occasionally
losing
the
thread
of
his
sentences
and
drawling
his
words
he
pounced
upon
raskolnikov
as
greedily
as
though
he
too
had
not
spoken
to
a
soul
for
a
month
honoured
sir
he
began
almost
with
solemnity
poverty
is
not
a
vice
that
s
a
true
saying
yet
i
know
too
that
drunkenness
is
not
a
virtue
and
that
that
s
even
truer
but
beggary
honoured
sir
beggary
is
a
vice
in
poverty
you
may
still
retain
your
innate
nobility
of
soul
but
in
beggary
never
no
one
for
beggary
a
man
is
not
chased
out
of
human
society
with
a
stick
he
is
swept
out
with
a
broom
so
as
to
make
it
as
humiliating
as
possible
and
quite
right
too
forasmuch
as
in
beggary
i
am
ready
to
be
the
first
to
humiliate
myself
hence
the
pot
house
honoured
sir
a
month
ago
mr
lebeziatnikov
gave
my
wife
a
beating
and
my
wife
is
a
very
different
matter
from
me
do
you
understand
allow
me
to
ask
you
another
question
out
of
simple
curiosity
have
you
ever
spent
a
night
on
a
hay
barge
on
the
neva
no
i
have
not
happened
to
answered
raskolnikov
what
do
you
mean
well
i
ve
just
come
from
one
and
it
s
the
fifth
night
i
ve
slept
so
he
filled
his
glass
emptied
it
and
paused
bits
of
hay
were
in
fact
clinging
to
his
clothes
and
sticking
to
his
hair
it
seemed
quite
probable
that
he
had
not
undressed
or
washed
for
the
last
five
days
his
hands
particularly
were
filthy
they
were
fat
and
red
with
black
nails
his
conversation
seemed
to
excite
a
general
though
languid
interest
the
boys
at
the
counter
fell
to
sniggering
the
innkeeper
came
down
from
the
upper
room
apparently
on
purpose
to
listen
to
the
funny
fellow
and
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
yawning
lazily
but
with
dignity
evidently
marmeladov
was
a
familiar
figure
here
and
he
had
most
likely
acquired
his
weakness
for
high
flown
speeches
from
the
habit
of
frequently
entering
into
conversation
with
strangers
of
all
sorts
in
the
tavern
this
habit
develops
into
a
necessity
in
some
drunkards
and
especially
in
those
who
are
looked
after
sharply
and
kept
in
order
at
home
hence
in
the
company
of
other
drinkers
they
try
to
justify
themselves
and
even
if
possible
obtain
consideration
funny
fellow
pronounced
the
innkeeper
and
why
don
t
you
work
why
aren
t
you
at
your
duty
if
you
are
in
the
service
why
am
i
not
at
my
duty
honoured
sir
marmeladov
went
on
addressing
himself
exclusively
to
raskolnikov
as
though
it
had
been
he
who
put
that
question
to
him
why
am
i
not
at
my
duty
does
not
my
heart
ache
to
think
what
a
useless
worm
i
am
a
month
ago
when
mr
lebeziatnikov
beat
my
wife
with
his
own
hands
and
i
lay
drunk
didn
t
i
suffer
excuse
me
young
man
has
it
ever
happened
to
you
hm
well
to
petition
hopelessly
for
a
loan
yes
it
has
but
what
do
you
mean
by
hopelessly
hopelessly
in
the
fullest
sense
when
you
know
beforehand
that
you
will
get
nothing
by
it
you
know
for
instance
beforehand
with
positive
certainty
that
this
man
this
most
reputable
and
exemplary
citizen
will
on
no
consideration
give
you
money
and
indeed
i
ask
you
why
should
he
for
he
knows
of
course
that
i
shan
t
pay
it
back
from
compassion
but
mr
lebeziatnikov
who
keeps
up
with
modern
ideas
explained
the
other
day
that
compassion
is
forbidden
nowadays
by
science
itself
and
that
that
s
what
is
done
now
in
england
where
there
is
political
economy
why
i
ask
you
should
he
give
it
to
me
and
yet
though
i
know
beforehand
that
he
won
t
i
set
off
to
him
and
why
do
you
go
put
in
raskolnikov
well
when
one
has
no
one
nowhere
else
one
can
go
for
every
man
must
have
somewhere
to
go
since
there
are
times
when
one
absolutely
must
go
somewhere
when
my
own
daughter
first
went
out
with
a
yellow
ticket
then
i
had
to
go
for
my
daughter
has
a
yellow
passport
he
added
in
parenthesis
looking
with
a
certain
uneasiness
at
the
young
man
no
matter
sir
no
matter
he
went
on
hurriedly
and
with
apparent
composure
when
both
the
boys
at
the
counter
guffawed
and
even
the
innkeeper
smiled
no
matter
i
am
not
confounded
by
the
wagging
of
their
heads
for
everyone
knows
everything
about
it
already
and
all
that
is
secret
is
made
open
and
i
accept
it
all
not
with
contempt
but
with
humility
so
be
it
so
be
it
behold
the
man
excuse
me
young
man
can
you
no
to
put
it
more
strongly
and
more
distinctly
not
can
you
but
dare
you
looking
upon
me
assert
that
i
am
not
a
pig
the
young
man
did
not
answer
a
word
well
the
orator
began
again
stolidly
and
with
even
increased
dignity
after
waiting
for
the
laughter
in
the
room
to
subside
well
so
be
it
i
am
a
pig
but
she
is
a
lady
i
have
the
semblance
of
a
beast
but
katerina
ivanovna
my
spouse
is
a
person
of
education
and
an
officer
s
daughter
granted
granted
i
am
a
scoundrel
but
she
is
a
woman
of
a
noble
heart
full
of
sentiments
refined
by
education
and
yet
oh
if
only
she
felt
for
me
honoured
sir
honoured
sir
you
know
every
man
ought
to
have
at
least
one
place
where
people
feel
for
him
but
katerina
ivanovna
though
she
is
magnanimous
she
is
unjust
and
yet
although
i
realise
that
when
she
pulls
my
hair
she
only
does
it
out
of
pity
for
i
repeat
without
being
ashamed
she
pulls
my
hair
young
man
he
declared
with
redoubled
dignity
hearing
the
sniggering
again
but
my
god
if
she
would
but
once
but
no
no
it
s
all
in
vain
and
it
s
no
use
talking
no
use
talking
for
more
than
once
my
wish
did
come
true
and
more
than
once
she
has
felt
for
me
but
such
is
my
fate
and
i
am
a
beast
by
nature
rather
assented
the
innkeeper
yawning
marmeladov
struck
his
fist
resolutely
on
the
table
such
is
my
fate
do
you
know
sir
do
you
know
i
have
sold
her
very
stockings
for
drink
not
her
shoes
that
would
be
more
or
less
in
the
order
of
things
but
her
stockings
her
stockings
i
have
sold
for
drink
her
mohair
shawl
i
sold
for
drink
a
present
to
her
long
ago
her
own
property
not
mine
and
we
live
in
a
cold
room
and
she
caught
cold
this
winter
and
has
begun
coughing
and
spitting
blood
too
we
have
three
little
children
and
katerina
ivanovna
is
at
work
from
morning
till
night
she
is
scrubbing
and
cleaning
and
washing
the
children
for
she
s
been
used
to
cleanliness
from
a
child
but
her
chest
is
weak
and
she
has
a
tendency
to
consumption
and
i
feel
it
do
you
suppose
i
don
t
feel
it
and
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
feel
it
that
s
why
i
drink
too
i
try
to
find
sympathy
and
feeling
in
drink
i
drink
so
that
i
may
suffer
twice
as
much
and
as
though
in
despair
he
laid
his
head
down
on
the
table
young
man
he
went
on
raising
his
head
again
in
your
face
i
seem
to
read
some
trouble
of
mind
when
you
came
in
i
read
it
and
that
was
why
i
addressed
you
at
once
for
in
unfolding
to
you
the
story
of
my
life
i
do
not
wish
to
make
myself
a
laughing
stock
before
these
idle
listeners
who
indeed
know
all
about
it
already
but
i
am
looking
for
a
man
of
feeling
and
education
know
then
that
my
wife
was
educated
in
a
high
class
school
for
the
daughters
of
noblemen
and
on
leaving
she
danced
the
shawl
dance
before
the
governor
and
other
personages
for
which
she
was
presented
with
a
gold
medal
and
a
certificate
of
merit
the
medal
well
the
medal
of
course
was
sold
long
ago
hm
but
the
certificate
of
merit
is
in
her
trunk
still
and
not
long
ago
she
showed
it
to
our
landlady
and
although
she
is
most
continually
on
bad
terms
with
the
landlady
yet
she
wanted
to
tell
someone
or
other
of
her
past
honours
and
of
the
happy
days
that
are
gone
i
don
t
condemn
her
for
it
i
don
t
blame
her
for
the
one
thing
left
her
is
recollection
of
the
past
and
all
the
rest
is
dust
and
ashes
yes
yes
she
is
a
lady
of
spirit
proud
and
determined
she
scrubs
the
floors
herself
and
has
nothing
but
black
bread
to
eat
but
won
t
allow
herself
to
be
treated
with
disrespect
that
s
why
she
would
not
overlook
mr
lebeziatnikov
s
rudeness
to
her
and
so
when
he
gave
her
a
beating
for
it
she
took
to
her
bed
more
from
the
hurt
to
her
feelings
than
from
the
blows
she
was
a
widow
when
i
married
her
with
three
children
one
smaller
than
the
other
she
married
her
first
husband
an
infantry
officer
for
love
and
ran
away
with
him
from
her
father
s
house
she
was
exceedingly
fond
of
her
husband
but
he
gave
way
to
cards
got
into
trouble
and
with
that
he
died
he
used
to
beat
her
at
the
end
and
although
she
paid
him
back
of
which
i
have
authentic
documentary
evidence
to
this
day
she
speaks
of
him
with
tears
and
she
throws
him
up
to
me
and
i
am
glad
i
am
glad
that
though
only
in
imagination
she
should
think
of
herself
as
having
once
been
happy
and
she
was
left
at
his
death
with
three
children
in
a
wild
and
remote
district
where
i
happened
to
be
at
the
time
and
she
was
left
in
such
hopeless
poverty
that
although
i
have
seen
many
ups
and
downs
of
all
sort
i
don
t
feel
equal
to
describing
it
even
her
relations
had
all
thrown
her
off
and
she
was
proud
too
excessively
proud
and
then
honoured
sir
and
then
i
being
at
the
time
a
widower
with
a
daughter
of
fourteen
left
me
by
my
first
wife
offered
her
my
hand
for
i
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
such
suffering
you
can
judge
the
extremity
of
her
calamities
that
she
a
woman
of
education
and
culture
and
distinguished
family
should
have
consented
to
be
my
wife
but
she
did
weeping
and
sobbing
and
wringing
her
hands
she
married
me
for
she
had
nowhere
to
turn
do
you
understand
sir
do
you
understand
what
it
means
when
you
have
absolutely
nowhere
to
turn
no
that
you
don
t
understand
yet
and
for
a
whole
year
i
performed
my
duties
conscientiously
and
faithfully
and
did
not
touch
this
he
tapped
the
jug
with
his
finger
for
i
have
feelings
but
even
so
i
could
not
please
her
and
then
i
lost
my
place
too
and
that
through
no
fault
of
mine
but
through
changes
in
the
office
and
then
i
did
touch
it
it
will
be
a
year
and
a
half
ago
soon
since
we
found
ourselves
at
last
after
many
wanderings
and
numerous
calamities
in
this
magnificent
capital
adorned
with
innumerable
monuments
here
i
obtained
a
situation
i
obtained
it
and
i
lost
it
again
do
you
understand
this
time
it
was
through
my
own
fault
i
lost
it
for
my
weakness
had
come
out
we
have
now
part
of
a
room
at
amalia
fyodorovna
lippevechsel
s
and
what
we
live
upon
and
what
we
pay
our
rent
with
i
could
not
say
there
are
a
lot
of
people
living
there
besides
ourselves
dirt
and
disorder
a
perfect
bedlam
hm
yes
and
meanwhile
my
daughter
by
my
first
wife
has
grown
up
and
what
my
daughter
has
had
to
put
up
with
from
her
step
mother
whilst
she
was
growing
up
i
won
t
speak
of
for
though
katerina
ivanovna
is
full
of
generous
feelings
she
is
a
spirited
lady
irritable
and
short
tempered
yes
but
it
s
no
use
going
over
that
sonia
as
you
may
well
fancy
has
had
no
education
i
did
make
an
effort
four
years
ago
to
give
her
a
course
of
geography
and
universal
history
but
as
i
was
not
very
well
up
in
those
subjects
myself
and
we
had
no
suitable
books
and
what
books
we
had
hm
anyway
we
have
not
even
those
now
so
all
our
instruction
came
to
an
end
we
stopped
at
cyrus
of
persia
since
she
has
attained
years
of
maturity
she
has
read
other
books
of
romantic
tendency
and
of
late
she
had
read
with
great
interest
a
book
she
got
through
mr
lebeziatnikov
lewes
physiology
do
you
know
it
and
even
recounted
extracts
from
it
to
us
and
that
s
the
whole
of
her
education
and
now
may
i
venture
to
address
you
honoured
sir
on
my
own
account
with
a
private
question
do
you
suppose
that
a
respectable
poor
girl
can
earn
much
by
honest
work
not
fifteen
farthings
a
day
can
she
earn
if
she
is
respectable
and
has
no
special
talent
and
that
without
putting
her
work
down
for
an
instant
and
what
s
more
ivan
ivanitch
klopstock
the
civil
counsellor
have
you
heard
of
him
has
not
to
this
day
paid
her
for
the
half
dozen
linen
shirts
she
made
him
and
drove
her
roughly
away
stamping
and
reviling
her
on
the
pretext
that
the
shirt
collars
were
not
made
like
the
pattern
and
were
put
in
askew
and
there
are
the
little
ones
hungry
and
katerina
ivanovna
walking
up
and
down
and
wringing
her
hands
her
cheeks
flushed
red
as
they
always
are
in
that
disease
here
you
live
with
us
says
she
you
eat
and
drink
and
are
kept
warm
and
you
do
nothing
to
help
and
much
she
gets
to
eat
and
drink
when
there
is
not
a
crust
for
the
little
ones
for
three
days
i
was
lying
at
the
time
well
what
of
it
i
was
lying
drunk
and
i
heard
my
sonia
speaking
she
is
a
gentle
creature
with
a
soft
little
voice
fair
hair
and
such
a
pale
thin
little
face
she
said
katerina
ivanovna
am
i
really
to
do
a
thing
like
that
and
darya
frantsovna
a
woman
of
evil
character
and
very
well
known
to
the
police
had
two
or
three
times
tried
to
get
at
her
through
the
landlady
and
why
not
said
katerina
ivanovna
with
a
jeer
you
are
something
mighty
precious
to
be
so
careful
of
but
don
t
blame
her
don
t
blame
her
honoured
sir
don
t
blame
her
she
was
not
herself
when
she
spoke
but
driven
to
distraction
by
her
illness
and
the
crying
of
the
hungry
children
and
it
was
said
more
to
wound
her
than
anything
else
for
that
s
katerina
ivanovna
s
character
and
when
children
cry
even
from
hunger
she
falls
to
beating
them
at
once
at
six
o
clock
i
saw
sonia
get
up
put
on
her
kerchief
and
her
cape
and
go
out
of
the
room
and
about
nine
o
clock
she
came
back
she
walked
straight
up
to
katerina
ivanovna
and
she
laid
thirty
roubles
on
the
table
before
her
in
silence
she
did
not
utter
a
word
she
did
not
even
look
at
her
she
simply
picked
up
our
big
green
drap
de
dames
shawl
we
have
a
shawl
made
of
drap
de
dames
put
it
over
her
head
and
face
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
with
her
face
to
the
wall
only
her
little
shoulders
and
her
body
kept
shuddering
and
i
went
on
lying
there
just
as
before
and
then
i
saw
young
man
i
saw
katerina
ivanovna
in
the
same
silence
go
up
to
sonia
s
little
bed
she
was
on
her
knees
all
the
evening
kissing
sonia
s
feet
and
would
not
get
up
and
then
they
both
fell
asleep
in
each
other
s
arms
together
together
yes
and
i
lay
drunk
marmeladov
stopped
short
as
though
his
voice
had
failed
him
then
he
hurriedly
filled
his
glass
drank
and
cleared
his
throat
since
then
sir
he
went
on
after
a
brief
pause
since
then
owing
to
an
unfortunate
occurrence
and
through
information
given
by
evil
intentioned
persons
in
all
which
darya
frantsovna
took
a
leading
part
on
the
pretext
that
she
had
been
treated
with
want
of
respect
since
then
my
daughter
sofya
semyonovna
has
been
forced
to
take
a
yellow
ticket
and
owing
to
that
she
is
unable
to
go
on
living
with
us
for
our
landlady
amalia
fyodorovna
would
not
hear
of
it
though
she
had
backed
up
darya
frantsovna
before
and
mr
lebeziatnikov
too
hm
all
the
trouble
between
him
and
katerina
ivanovna
was
on
sonia
s
account
at
first
he
was
for
making
up
to
sonia
himself
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
stood
on
his
dignity
how
said
he
can
a
highly
educated
man
like
me
live
in
the
same
rooms
with
a
girl
like
that
and
katerina
ivanovna
would
not
let
it
pass
she
stood
up
for
her
and
so
that
s
how
it
happened
and
sonia
comes
to
us
now
mostly
after
dark
she
comforts
katerina
ivanovna
and
gives
her
all
she
can
she
has
a
room
at
the
kapernaumovs
the
tailors
she
lodges
with
them
kapernaumov
is
a
lame
man
with
a
cleft
palate
and
all
of
his
numerous
family
have
cleft
palates
too
and
his
wife
too
has
a
cleft
palate
they
all
live
in
one
room
but
sonia
has
her
own
partitioned
off
hm
yes
very
poor
people
and
all
with
cleft
palates
yes
then
i
got
up
in
the
morning
and
put
on
my
rags
lifted
up
my
hands
to
heaven
and
set
off
to
his
excellency
ivan
afanasyvitch
his
excellency
ivan
afanasyvitch
do
you
know
him
no
well
then
it
s
a
man
of
god
you
don
t
know
he
is
wax
wax
before
the
face
of
the
lord
even
as
wax
melteth
his
eyes
were
dim
when
he
heard
my
story
marmeladov
once
already
you
have
deceived
my
expectations
i
ll
take
you
once
more
on
my
own
responsibility
that
s
what
he
said
remember
he
said
and
now
you
can
go
i
kissed
the
dust
at
his
feet
in
thought
only
for
in
reality
he
would
not
have
allowed
me
to
do
it
being
a
statesman
and
a
man
of
modern
political
and
enlightened
ideas
i
returned
home
and
when
i
announced
that
i
d
been
taken
back
into
the
service
and
should
receive
a
salary
heavens
what
a
to
do
there
was
marmeladov
stopped
again
in
violent
excitement
at
that
moment
a
whole
party
of
revellers
already
drunk
came
in
from
the
street
and
the
sounds
of
a
hired
concertina
and
the
cracked
piping
voice
of
a
child
of
seven
singing
the
hamlet
were
heard
in
the
entry
the
room
was
filled
with
noise
the
tavern
keeper
and
the
boys
were
busy
with
the
new
comers
marmeladov
paying
no
attention
to
the
new
arrivals
continued
his
story
he
appeared
by
now
to
be
extremely
weak
but
as
he
became
more
and
more
drunk
he
became
more
and
more
talkative
the
recollection
of
his
recent
success
in
getting
the
situation
seemed
to
revive
him
and
was
positively
reflected
in
a
sort
of
radiance
on
his
face
raskolnikov
listened
attentively
that
was
five
weeks
ago
sir
yes
as
soon
as
katerina
ivanovna
and
sonia
heard
of
it
mercy
on
us
it
was
as
though
i
stepped
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
used
to
be
you
can
lie
like
a
beast
nothing
but
abuse
now
they
were
walking
on
tiptoe
hushing
the
children
semyon
zaharovitch
is
tired
with
his
work
at
the
office
he
is
resting
shh
they
made
me
coffee
before
i
went
to
work
and
boiled
cream
for
me
they
began
to
get
real
cream
for
me
do
you
hear
that
and
how
they
managed
to
get
together
the
money
for
a
decent
outfit
eleven
roubles
fifty
copecks
i
can
t
guess
boots
cotton
shirt
fronts
most
magnificent
a
uniform
they
got
up
all
in
splendid
style
for
eleven
roubles
and
a
half
the
first
morning
i
came
back
from
the
office
i
found
katerina
ivanovna
had
cooked
two
courses
for
dinner
soup
and
salt
meat
with
horse
radish
which
we
had
never
dreamed
of
till
then
she
had
not
any
dresses
none
at
all
but
she
got
herself
up
as
though
she
were
going
on
a
visit
and
not
that
she
d
anything
to
do
it
with
she
smartened
herself
up
with
nothing
at
all
she
d
done
her
hair
nicely
put
on
a
clean
collar
of
some
sort
cuffs
and
there
she
was
quite
a
different
person
she
was
younger
and
better
looking
sonia
my
little
darling
had
only
helped
with
money
for
the
time
she
said
it
won
t
do
for
me
to
come
and
see
you
too
often
after
dark
maybe
when
no
one
can
see
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
i
lay
down
for
a
nap
after
dinner
and
what
do
you
think
though
katerina
ivanovna
had
quarrelled
to
the
last
degree
with
our
landlady
amalia
fyodorovna
only
a
week
before
she
could
not
resist
then
asking
her
in
to
coffee
for
two
hours
they
were
sitting
whispering
together
semyon
zaharovitch
is
in
the
service
again
now
and
receiving
a
salary
says
she
and
he
went
himself
to
his
excellency
and
his
excellency
himself
came
out
to
him
made
all
the
others
wait
and
led
semyon
zaharovitch
by
the
hand
before
everybody
into
his
study
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
to
be
sure
says
he
semyon
zaharovitch
remembering
your
past
services
says
he
and
in
spite
of
your
propensity
to
that
foolish
weakness
since
you
promise
now
and
since
moreover
we
ve
got
on
badly
without
you
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
and
so
says
he
i
rely
now
on
your
word
as
a
gentleman
and
all
that
let
me
tell
you
she
has
simply
made
up
for
herself
and
not
simply
out
of
wantonness
for
the
sake
of
bragging
no
she
believes
it
all
herself
she
amuses
herself
with
her
own
fancies
upon
my
word
she
does
and
i
don
t
blame
her
for
it
no
i
don
t
blame
her
six
days
ago
when
i
brought
her
my
first
earnings
in
full
twenty
three
roubles
forty
copecks
altogether
she
called
me
her
poppet
poppet
said
she
my
little
poppet
and
when
we
were
by
ourselves
you
understand
you
would
not
think
me
a
beauty
you
would
not
think
much
of
me
as
a
husband
would
you
well
she
pinched
my
cheek
my
little
poppet
said
she
marmeladov
broke
off
tried
to
smile
but
suddenly
his
chin
began
to
twitch
he
controlled
himself
however
the
tavern
the
degraded
appearance
of
the
man
the
five
nights
in
the
hay
barge
and
the
pot
of
spirits
and
yet
this
poignant
love
for
his
wife
and
children
bewildered
his
listener
raskolnikov
listened
intently
but
with
a
sick
sensation
he
felt
vexed
that
he
had
come
here
honoured
sir
honoured
sir
cried
marmeladov
recovering
himself
oh
sir
perhaps
all
this
seems
a
laughing
matter
to
you
as
it
does
to
others
and
perhaps
i
am
only
worrying
you
with
the
stupidity
of
all
the
trivial
details
of
my
home
life
but
it
is
not
a
laughing
matter
to
me
for
i
can
feel
it
all
and
the
whole
of
that
heavenly
day
of
my
life
and
the
whole
of
that
evening
i
passed
in
fleeting
dreams
of
how
i
would
arrange
it
all
and
how
i
would
dress
all
the
children
and
how
i
should
give
her
rest
and
how
i
should
rescue
my
own
daughter
from
dishonour
and
restore
her
to
the
bosom
of
her
family
and
a
great
deal
more
quite
excusable
sir
well
then
sir
marmeladov
suddenly
gave
a
sort
of
start
raised
his
head
and
gazed
intently
at
his
listener
well
on
the
very
next
day
after
all
those
dreams
that
is
to
say
exactly
five
days
ago
in
the
evening
by
a
cunning
trick
like
a
thief
in
the
night
i
stole
from
katerina
ivanovna
the
key
of
her
box
took
out
what
was
left
of
my
earnings
how
much
it
was
i
have
forgotten
and
now
look
at
me
all
of
you
it
s
the
fifth
day
since
i
left
home
and
they
are
looking
for
me
there
and
it
s
the
end
of
my
employment
and
my
uniform
is
lying
in
a
tavern
on
the
egyptian
bridge
i
exchanged
it
for
the
garments
i
have
on
and
it
s
the
end
of
everything
marmeladov
struck
his
forehead
with
his
fist
clenched
his
teeth
closed
his
eyes
and
leaned
heavily
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
but
a
minute
later
his
face
suddenly
changed
and
with
a
certain
assumed
slyness
and
affectation
of
bravado
he
glanced
at
raskolnikov
laughed
and
said
this
morning
i
went
to
see
sonia
i
went
to
ask
her
for
a
pick
me
up
he
he
he
you
don
t
say
she
gave
it
to
you
cried
one
of
the
new
comers
he
shouted
the
words
and
went
off
into
a
guffaw
this
very
quart
was
bought
with
her
money
marmeladov
declared
addressing
himself
exclusively
to
raskolnikov
thirty
copecks
she
gave
me
with
her
own
hands
her
last
all
she
had
as
i
saw
she
said
nothing
she
only
looked
at
me
without
a
word
not
on
earth
but
up
yonder
they
grieve
over
men
they
weep
but
they
don
t
blame
them
they
don
t
blame
them
but
it
hurts
more
it
hurts
more
when
they
don
t
blame
thirty
copecks
yes
and
maybe
she
needs
them
now
eh
what
do
you
think
my
dear
sir
for
now
she
s
got
to
keep
up
her
appearance
it
costs
money
that
smartness
that
special
smartness
you
know
do
you
understand
and
there
s
pomatum
too
you
see
she
must
have
things
petticoats
starched
ones
shoes
too
real
jaunty
ones
to
show
off
her
foot
when
she
has
to
step
over
a
puddle
do
you
understand
sir
do
you
understand
what
all
that
smartness
means
and
here
i
her
own
father
here
i
took
thirty
copecks
of
that
money
for
a
drink
and
i
am
drinking
it
and
i
have
already
drunk
it
come
who
will
have
pity
on
a
man
like
me
eh
are
you
sorry
for
me
sir
or
not
tell
me
sir
are
you
sorry
or
not
he
he
he
he
would
have
filled
his
glass
but
there
was
no
drink
left
the
pot
was
empty
what
are
you
to
be
pitied
for
shouted
the
tavern
keeper
who
was
again
near
them
shouts
of
laughter
and
even
oaths
followed
the
laughter
and
the
oaths
came
from
those
who
were
listening
and
also
from
those
who
had
heard
nothing
but
were
simply
looking
at
the
figure
of
the
discharged
government
clerk
to
be
pitied
why
am
i
to
be
pitied
marmeladov
suddenly
declaimed
standing
up
with
his
arm
outstretched
as
though
he
had
been
only
waiting
for
that
question
why
am
i
to
be
pitied
you
say
yes
there
s
nothing
to
pity
me
for
i
ought
to
be
crucified
crucified
on
a
cross
not
pitied
crucify
me
oh
judge
crucify
me
but
pity
me
and
then
i
will
go
of
myself
to
be
crucified
for
it
s
not
merry
making
i
seek
but
tears
and
tribulation
do
you
suppose
you
that
sell
that
this
pint
of
yours
has
been
sweet
to
me
it
was
tribulation
i
sought
at
the
bottom
of
it
tears
and
tribulation
and
have
found
it
and
i
have
tasted
it
but
he
will
pity
us
who
has
had
pity
on
all
men
who
has
understood
all
men
and
all
things
he
is
the
one
he
too
is
the
judge
he
will
come
in
that
day
and
he
will
ask
where
is
the
daughter
who
gave
herself
for
her
cross
consumptive
step
mother
and
for
the
little
children
of
another
where
is
the
daughter
who
had
pity
upon
the
filthy
drunkard
her
earthly
father
undismayed
by
his
beastliness
and
he
will
say
come
to
me
i
have
already
forgiven
thee
once
i
have
forgiven
thee
once
thy
sins
which
are
many
are
forgiven
thee
for
thou
hast
loved
much
and
he
will
forgive
my
sonia
he
will
forgive
i
know
it
i
felt
it
in
my
heart
when
i
was
with
her
just
now
and
he
will
judge
and
will
forgive
all
the
good
and
the
evil
the
wise
and
the
meek
and
when
he
has
done
with
all
of
them
then
he
will
summon
us
you
too
come
forth
he
will
say
come
forth
ye
drunkards
come
forth
ye
weak
ones
come
forth
ye
children
of
shame
and
we
shall
all
come
forth
without
shame
and
shall
stand
before
him
and
he
will
say
unto
us
ye
are
swine
made
in
the
image
of
the
beast
and
with
his
mark
but
come
ye
also
and
the
wise
ones
and
those
of
understanding
will
say
oh
lord
why
dost
thou
receive
these
men
and
he
will
say
this
is
why
i
receive
them
oh
ye
wise
this
is
why
i
receive
them
oh
ye
of
understanding
that
not
one
of
them
believed
himself
to
be
worthy
of
this
and
he
will
hold
out
his
hands
to
us
and
we
shall
fall
down
before
him
and
we
shall
weep
and
we
shall
understand
all
things
then
we
shall
understand
all
and
all
will
understand
katerina
ivanovna
even
she
will
understand
lord
thy
kingdom
come
and
he
sank
down
on
the
bench
exhausted
and
helpless
looking
at
no
one
apparently
oblivious
of
his
surroundings
and
plunged
in
deep
thought
his
words
had
created
a
certain
impression
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
but
soon
laughter
and
oaths
were
heard
again
that
s
his
notion
talked
himself
silly
a
fine
clerk
he
is
and
so
on
and
so
on
let
us
go
sir
said
marmeladov
all
at
once
raising
his
head
and
addressing
raskolnikov
come
along
with
me
kozel
s
house
looking
into
the
yard
i
m
going
to
katerina
ivanovna
time
i
did
raskolnikov
had
for
some
time
been
wanting
to
go
and
he
had
meant
to
help
him
marmeladov
was
much
unsteadier
on
his
legs
than
in
his
speech
and
leaned
heavily
on
the
young
man
they
had
two
or
three
hundred
paces
to
go
the
drunken
man
was
more
and
more
overcome
by
dismay
and
confusion
as
they
drew
nearer
the
house
it
s
not
katerina
ivanovna
i
am
afraid
of
now
he
muttered
in
agitation
and
that
she
will
begin
pulling
my
hair
what
does
my
hair
matter
bother
my
hair
that
s
what
i
say
indeed
it
will
be
better
if
she
does
begin
pulling
it
that
s
not
what
i
am
afraid
of
it
s
her
eyes
i
am
afraid
of
yes
her
eyes
the
red
on
her
cheeks
too
frightens
me
and
her
breathing
too
have
you
noticed
how
people
in
that
disease
breathe
when
they
are
excited
i
am
frightened
of
the
children
s
crying
too
for
if
sonia
has
not
taken
them
food
i
don
t
know
what
s
happened
i
don
t
know
but
blows
i
am
not
afraid
of
know
sir
that
such
blows
are
not
a
pain
to
me
but
even
an
enjoyment
in
fact
i
can
t
get
on
without
it
it
s
better
so
let
her
strike
me
it
relieves
her
heart
it
s
better
so
there
is
the
house
the
house
of
kozel
the
cabinet
maker
a
german
well
to
do
lead
the
way
they
went
in
from
the
yard
and
up
to
the
fourth
storey
the
staircase
got
darker
and
darker
as
they
went
up
it
was
nearly
eleven
o
clock
and
although
in
summer
in
petersburg
there
is
no
real
night
yet
it
was
quite
dark
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
a
grimy
little
door
at
the
very
top
of
the
stairs
stood
ajar
a
very
poor
looking
room
about
ten
paces
long
was
lighted
up
by
a
candle
end
the
whole
of
it
was
visible
from
the
entrance
it
was
all
in
disorder
littered
up
with
rags
of
all
sorts
especially
children
s
garments
across
the
furthest
corner
was
stretched
a
ragged
sheet
behind
it
probably
was
the
bed
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
except
two
chairs
and
a
sofa
covered
with
american
leather
full
of
holes
before
which
stood
an
old
deal
kitchen
table
unpainted
and
uncovered
at
the
edge
of
the
table
stood
a
smoldering
tallow
candle
in
an
iron
candlestick
it
appeared
that
the
family
had
a
room
to
themselves
not
part
of
a
room
but
their
room
was
practically
a
passage
the
door
leading
to
the
other
rooms
or
rather
cupboards
into
which
amalia
lippevechsel
s
flat
was
divided
stood
half
open
and
there
was
shouting
uproar
and
laughter
within
people
seemed
to
be
playing
cards
and
drinking
tea
there
words
of
the
most
unceremonious
kind
flew
out
from
time
to
time
raskolnikov
recognised
katerina
ivanovna
at
once
she
was
a
rather
tall
slim
and
graceful
woman
terribly
emaciated
with
magnificent
dark
brown
hair
and
with
a
hectic
flush
in
her
cheeks
she
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
her
little
room
pressing
her
hands
against
her
chest
her
lips
were
parched
and
her
breathing
came
in
nervous
broken
gasps
her
eyes
glittered
as
in
fever
and
looked
about
with
a
harsh
immovable
stare
and
that
consumptive
and
excited
face
with
the
last
flickering
light
of
the
candle
end
playing
upon
it
made
a
sickening
impression
she
seemed
to
raskolnikov
about
thirty
years
old
and
was
certainly
a
strange
wife
for
marmeladov
she
had
not
heard
them
and
did
not
notice
them
coming
in
she
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
hearing
and
seeing
nothing
the
room
was
close
but
she
had
not
opened
the
window
a
stench
rose
from
the
staircase
but
the
door
on
to
the
stairs
was
not
closed
from
the
inner
rooms
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
floated
in
she
kept
coughing
but
did
not
close
the
door
the
youngest
child
a
girl
of
six
was
asleep
sitting
curled
up
on
the
floor
with
her
head
on
the
sofa
a
boy
a
year
older
stood
crying
and
shaking
in
the
corner
probably
he
had
just
had
a
beating
beside
him
stood
a
girl
of
nine
years
old
tall
and
thin
wearing
a
thin
and
ragged
chemise
with
an
ancient
cashmere
pelisse
flung
over
her
bare
shoulders
long
outgrown
and
barely
reaching
her
knees
her
arm
as
thin
as
a
stick
was
round
her
brother
s
neck
she
was
trying
to
comfort
him
whispering
something
to
him
and
doing
all
she
could
to
keep
him
from
whimpering
again
at
the
same
time
her
large
dark
eyes
which
looked
larger
still
from
the
thinness
of
her
frightened
face
were
watching
her
mother
with
alarm
marmeladov
did
not
enter
the
door
but
dropped
on
his
knees
in
the
very
doorway
pushing
raskolnikov
in
front
of
him
the
woman
seeing
a
stranger
stopped
indifferently
facing
him
coming
to
herself
for
a
moment
and
apparently
wondering
what
he
had
come
for
but
evidently
she
decided
that
he
was
going
into
the
next
room
as
he
had
to
pass
through
hers
to
get
there
taking
no
further
notice
of
him
she
walked
towards
the
outer
door
to
close
it
and
uttered
a
sudden
scream
on
seeing
her
husband
on
his
knees
in
the
doorway
ah
she
cried
out
in
a
frenzy
he
has
come
back
the
criminal
the
monster
and
where
is
the
money
what
s
in
your
pocket
show
me
and
your
clothes
are
all
different
where
are
your
clothes
where
is
the
money
speak
and
she
fell
to
searching
him
marmeladov
submissively
and
obediently
held
up
both
arms
to
facilitate
the
search
not
a
farthing
was
there
where
is
the
money
she
cried
mercy
on
us
can
he
have
drunk
it
all
there
were
twelve
silver
roubles
left
in
the
chest
and
in
a
fury
she
seized
him
by
the
hair
and
dragged
him
into
the
room
marmeladov
seconded
her
efforts
by
meekly
crawling
along
on
his
knees
and
this
is
a
consolation
to
me
this
does
not
hurt
me
but
is
a
positive
con
so
la
tion
ho
nou
red
sir
he
called
out
shaken
to
and
fro
by
his
hair
and
even
once
striking
the
ground
with
his
forehead
the
child
asleep
on
the
floor
woke
up
and
began
to
cry
the
boy
in
the
corner
losing
all
control
began
trembling
and
screaming
and
rushed
to
his
sister
in
violent
terror
almost
in
a
fit
the
eldest
girl
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
he
s
drunk
it
he
s
drunk
it
all
the
poor
woman
screamed
in
despair
and
his
clothes
are
gone
and
they
are
hungry
hungry
and
wringing
her
hands
she
pointed
to
the
children
oh
accursed
life
and
you
are
you
not
ashamed
she
pounced
all
at
once
upon
raskolnikov
from
the
tavern
have
you
been
drinking
with
him
you
have
been
drinking
with
him
too
go
away
the
young
man
was
hastening
away
without
uttering
a
word
the
inner
door
was
thrown
wide
open
and
inquisitive
faces
were
peering
in
at
it
coarse
laughing
faces
with
pipes
and
cigarettes
and
heads
wearing
caps
thrust
themselves
in
at
the
doorway
further
in
could
be
seen
figures
in
dressing
gowns
flung
open
in
costumes
of
unseemly
scantiness
some
of
them
with
cards
in
their
hands
they
were
particularly
diverted
when
marmeladov
dragged
about
by
his
hair
shouted
that
it
was
a
consolation
to
him
they
even
began
to
come
into
the
room
at
last
a
sinister
shrill
outcry
was
heard
this
came
from
amalia
lippevechsel
herself
pushing
her
way
amongst
them
and
trying
to
restore
order
after
her
own
fashion
and
for
the
hundredth
time
to
frighten
the
poor
woman
by
ordering
her
with
coarse
abuse
to
clear
out
of
the
room
next
day
as
he
went
out
raskolnikov
had
time
to
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
to
snatch
up
the
coppers
he
had
received
in
exchange
for
his
rouble
in
the
tavern
and
to
lay
them
unnoticed
on
the
window
afterwards
on
the
stairs
he
changed
his
mind
and
would
have
gone
back
what
a
stupid
thing
i
ve
done
he
thought
to
himself
they
have
sonia
and
i
want
it
myself
but
reflecting
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
it
back
now
and
that
in
any
case
he
would
not
have
taken
it
he
dismissed
it
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
went
back
to
his
lodging
sonia
wants
pomatum
too
he
said
as
he
walked
along
the
street
and
he
laughed
malignantly
such
smartness
costs
money
hm
and
maybe
sonia
herself
will
be
bankrupt
to
day
for
there
is
always
a
risk
hunting
big
game
digging
for
gold
then
they
would
all
be
without
a
crust
to
morrow
except
for
my
money
hurrah
for
sonia
what
a
mine
they
ve
dug
there
and
they
re
making
the
most
of
it
yes
they
are
making
the
most
of
it
they
ve
wept
over
it
and
grown
used
to
it
man
grows
used
to
everything
the
scoundrel
he
sank
into
thought
and
what
if
i
am
wrong
he
cried
suddenly
after
a
moment
s
thought
what
if
man
is
not
really
a
scoundrel
man
in
general
i
mean
the
whole
race
of
mankind
then
all
the
rest
is
prejudice
simply
artificial
terrors
and
there
are
no
barriers
and
it
s
all
as
it
should
be
chapter
iii
he
waked
up
late
next
day
after
a
broken
sleep
but
his
sleep
had
not
refreshed
him
he
waked
up
bilious
irritable
ill
tempered
and
looked
with
hatred
at
his
room
it
was
a
tiny
cupboard
of
a
room
about
six
paces
in
length
it
had
a
poverty
stricken
appearance
with
its
dusty
yellow
paper
peeling
off
the
walls
and
it
was
so
low
pitched
that
a
man
of
more
than
average
height
was
ill
at
ease
in
it
and
felt
every
moment
that
he
would
knock
his
head
against
the
ceiling
the
furniture
was
in
keeping
with
the
room
there
were
three
old
chairs
rather
rickety
a
painted
table
in
the
corner
on
which
lay
a
few
manuscripts
and
books
the
dust
that
lay
thick
upon
them
showed
that
they
had
been
long
untouched
a
big
clumsy
sofa
occupied
almost
the
whole
of
one
wall
and
half
the
floor
space
of
the
room
it
was
once
covered
with
chintz
but
was
now
in
rags
and
served
raskolnikov
as
a
bed
often
he
went
to
sleep
on
it
as
he
was
without
undressing
without
sheets
wrapped
in
his
old
student
s
overcoat
with
his
head
on
one
little
pillow
under
which
he
heaped
up
all
the
linen
he
had
clean
and
dirty
by
way
of
a
bolster
a
little
table
stood
in
front
of
the
sofa
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
sink
to
a
lower
ebb
of
disorder
but
to
raskolnikov
in
his
present
state
of
mind
this
was
positively
agreeable
he
had
got
completely
away
from
everyone
like
a
tortoise
in
its
shell
and
even
the
sight
of
a
servant
girl
who
had
to
wait
upon
him
and
looked
sometimes
into
his
room
made
him
writhe
with
nervous
irritation
he
was
in
the
condition
that
overtakes
some
monomaniacs
entirely
concentrated
upon
one
thing
his
landlady
had
for
the
last
fortnight
given
up
sending
him
in
meals
and
he
had
not
yet
thought
of
expostulating
with
her
though
he
went
without
his
dinner
nastasya
the
cook
and
only
servant
was
rather
pleased
at
the
lodger
s
mood
and
had
entirely
given
up
sweeping
and
doing
his
room
only
once
a
week
or
so
she
would
stray
into
his
room
with
a
broom
she
waked
him
up
that
day
get
up
why
are
you
asleep
she
called
to
him
it
s
past
nine
i
have
brought
you
some
tea
will
you
have
a
cup
i
should
think
you
re
fairly
starving
raskolnikov
opened
his
eyes
started
and
recognised
nastasya
from
the
landlady
eh
he
asked
slowly
and
with
a
sickly
face
sitting
up
on
the
sofa
from
the
landlady
indeed
she
set
before
him
her
own
cracked
teapot
full
of
weak
and
stale
tea
and
laid
two
yellow
lumps
of
sugar
by
the
side
of
it
here
nastasya
take
it
please
he
said
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
he
had
slept
in
his
clothes
and
taking
out
a
handful
of
coppers
run
and
buy
me
a
loaf
and
get
me
a
little
sausage
the
cheapest
at
the
pork
butcher
s
the
loaf
i
ll
fetch
you
this
very
minute
but
wouldn
t
you
rather
have
some
cabbage
soup
instead
of
sausage
it
s
capital
soup
yesterday
s
i
saved
it
for
you
yesterday
but
you
came
in
late
it
s
fine
soup
when
the
soup
had
been
brought
and
he
had
begun
upon
it
nastasya
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
sofa
and
began
chatting
she
was
a
country
peasant
woman
and
a
very
talkative
one
praskovya
pavlovna
means
to
complain
to
the
police
about
you
she
said
he
scowled
to
the
police
what
does
she
want
you
don
t
pay
her
money
and
you
won
t
turn
out
of
the
room
that
s
what
she
wants
to
be
sure
the
devil
that
s
the
last
straw
he
muttered
grinding
his
teeth
no
that
would
not
suit
me
just
now
she
is
a
fool
he
added
aloud
i
ll
go
and
talk
to
her
to
day
fool
she
is
and
no
mistake
just
as
i
am
but
why
if
you
are
so
clever
do
you
lie
here
like
a
sack
and
have
nothing
to
show
for
it
one
time
you
used
to
go
out
you
say
to
teach
children
but
why
is
it
you
do
nothing
now
i
am
doing
raskolnikov
began
sullenly
and
reluctantly
what
are
you
doing
work
what
sort
of
work
i
am
thinking
he
answered
seriously
after
a
pause
nastasya
was
overcome
with
a
fit
of
laughter
she
was
given
to
laughter
and
when
anything
amused
her
she
laughed
inaudibly
quivering
and
shaking
all
over
till
she
felt
ill
and
have
you
made
much
money
by
your
thinking
she
managed
to
articulate
at
last
one
can
t
go
out
to
give
lessons
without
boots
and
i
m
sick
of
it
don
t
quarrel
with
your
bread
and
butter
they
pay
so
little
for
lessons
what
s
the
use
of
a
few
coppers
he
answered
reluctantly
as
though
replying
to
his
own
thought
and
you
want
to
get
a
fortune
all
at
once
he
looked
at
her
strangely
yes
i
want
a
fortune
he
answered
firmly
after
a
brief
pause
don
t
be
in
such
a
hurry
you
quite
frighten
me
shall
i
get
you
the
loaf
or
not
as
you
please
ah
i
forgot
a
letter
came
for
you
yesterday
when
you
were
out
a
letter
for
me
from
whom
i
can
t
say
i
gave
three
copecks
of
my
own
to
the
postman
for
it
will
you
pay
me
back
then
bring
it
to
me
for
god
s
sake
bring
it
cried
raskolnikov
greatly
excited
good
god
a
minute
later
the
letter
was
brought
him
that
was
it
from
his
mother
from
the
province
of
r
he
turned
pale
when
he
took
it
it
was
a
long
while
since
he
had
received
a
letter
but
another
feeling
also
suddenly
stabbed
his
heart
nastasya
leave
me
alone
for
goodness
sake
here
are
your
three
copecks
but
for
goodness
sake
make
haste
and
go
the
letter
was
quivering
in
his
hand
he
did
not
want
to
open
it
in
her
presence
he
wanted
to
be
left
alone
with
this
letter
when
nastasya
had
gone
out
he
lifted
it
quickly
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
then
he
gazed
intently
at
the
address
the
small
sloping
handwriting
so
dear
and
familiar
of
the
mother
who
had
once
taught
him
to
read
and
write
he
delayed
he
seemed
almost
afraid
of
something
at
last
he
opened
it
it
was
a
thick
heavy
letter
weighing
over
two
ounces
two
large
sheets
of
note
paper
were
covered
with
very
small
handwriting
my
dear
rodya
wrote
his
mother
it
s
two
months
since
i
last
had
a
talk
with
you
by
letter
which
has
distressed
me
and
even
kept
me
awake
at
night
thinking
but
i
am
sure
you
will
not
blame
me
for
my
inevitable
silence
you
know
how
i
love
you
you
are
all
we
have
to
look
to
dounia
and
i
you
are
our
all
our
one
hope
our
one
stay
what
a
grief
it
was
to
me
when
i
heard
that
you
had
given
up
the
university
some
months
ago
for
want
of
means
to
keep
yourself
and
that
you
had
lost
your
lessons
and
your
other
work
how
could
i
help
you
out
of
my
hundred
and
twenty
roubles
a
year
pension
the
fifteen
roubles
i
sent
you
four
months
ago
i
borrowed
as
you
know
on
security
of
my
pension
from
vassily
ivanovitch
vahrushin
a
merchant
of
this
town
he
is
a
kind
hearted
man
and
was
a
friend
of
your
father
s
too
but
having
given
him
the
right
to
receive
the
pension
i
had
to
wait
till
the
debt
was
paid
off
and
that
is
only
just
done
so
that
i
ve
been
unable
to
send
you
anything
all
this
time
but
now
thank
god
i
believe
i
shall
be
able
to
send
you
something
more
and
in
fact
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
good
fortune
now
of
which
i
hasten
to
inform
you
in
the
first
place
would
you
have
guessed
dear
rodya
that
your
sister
has
been
living
with
me
for
the
last
six
weeks
and
we
shall
not
be
separated
in
the
future
thank
god
her
sufferings
are
over
but
i
will
tell
you
everything
in
order
so
that
you
may
know
just
how
everything
has
happened
and
all
that
we
have
hitherto
concealed
from
you
when
you
wrote
to
me
two
months
ago
that
you
had
heard
that
dounia
had
a
great
deal
to
put
up
with
in
the
svidrigra
lovs
house
when
you
wrote
that
and
asked
me
to
tell
you
all
about
it
what
could
i
write
in
answer
to
you
if
i
had
written
the
whole
truth
to
you
i
dare
say
you
would
have
thrown
up
everything
and
have
come
to
us
even
if
you
had
to
walk
all
the
way
for
i
know
your
character
and
your
feelings
and
you
would
not
let
your
sister
be
insulted
i
was
in
despair
myself
but
what
could
i
do
and
besides
i
did
not
know
the
whole
truth
myself
then
what
made
it
all
so
difficult
was
that
dounia
received
a
hundred
roubles
in
advance
when
she
took
the
place
as
governess
in
their
family
on
condition
of
part
of
her
salary
being
deducted
every
month
and
so
it
was
impossible
to
throw
up
the
situation
without
repaying
the
debt
this
sum
now
i
can
explain
it
all
to
you
my
precious
rodya
she
took
chiefly
in
order
to
send
you
sixty
roubles
which
you
needed
so
terribly
then
and
which
you
received
from
us
last
year
we
deceived
you
then
writing
that
this
money
came
from
dounia
s
savings
but
that
was
not
so
and
now
i
tell
you
all
about
it
because
thank
god
things
have
suddenly
changed
for
the
better
and
that
you
may
know
how
dounia
loves
you
and
what
a
heart
she
has
at
first
indeed
mr
svidriga
lov
treated
her
very
rudely
and
used
to
make
disrespectful
and
jeering
remarks
at
table
but
i
don
t
want
to
go
into
all
those
painful
details
so
as
not
to
worry
you
for
nothing
when
it
is
now
all
over
in
short
in
spite
of
the
kind
and
generous
behaviour
of
marfa
petrovna
mr
svidriga
lov
s
wife
and
all
the
rest
of
the
household
dounia
had
a
very
hard
time
especially
when
mr
svidriga
lov
relapsing
into
his
old
regimental
habits
was
under
the
influence
of
bacchus
and
how
do
you
think
it
was
all
explained
later
on
would
you
believe
that
the
crazy
fellow
had
conceived
a
passion
for
dounia
from
the
beginning
but
had
concealed
it
under
a
show
of
rudeness
and
contempt
possibly
he
was
ashamed
and
horrified
himself
at
his
own
flighty
hopes
considering
his
years
and
his
being
the
father
of
a
family
and
that
made
him
angry
with
dounia
and
possibly
too
he
hoped
by
his
rude
and
sneering
behaviour
to
hide
the
truth
from
others
but
at
last
he
lost
all
control
and
had
the
face
to
make
dounia
an
open
and
shameful
proposal
promising
her
all
sorts
of
inducements
and
offering
besides
to
throw
up
everything
and
take
her
to
another
estate
of
his
or
even
abroad
you
can
imagine
all
she
went
through
to
leave
her
situation
at
once
was
impossible
not
only
on
account
of
the
money
debt
but
also
to
spare
the
feelings
of
marfa
petrovna
whose
suspicions
would
have
been
aroused
and
then
dounia
would
have
been
the
cause
of
a
rupture
in
the
family
and
it
would
have
meant
a
terrible
scandal
for
dounia
too
that
would
have
been
inevitable
there
were
various
other
reasons
owing
to
which
dounia
could
not
hope
to
escape
from
that
awful
house
for
another
six
weeks
you
know
dounia
of
course
you
know
how
clever
she
is
and
what
a
strong
will
she
has
dounia
can
endure
a
great
deal
and
even
in
the
most
difficult
cases
she
has
the
fortitude
to
maintain
her
firmness
she
did
not
even
write
to
me
about
everything
for
fear
of
upsetting
me
although
we
were
constantly
in
communication
it
all
ended
very
unexpectedly
marfa
petrovna
accidentally
overheard
her
husband
imploring
dounia
in
the
garden
and
putting
quite
a
wrong
interpretation
on
the
position
threw
the
blame
upon
her
believing
her
to
be
the
cause
of
it
all
an
awful
scene
took
place
between
them
on
the
spot
in
the
garden
marfa
petrovna
went
so
far
as
to
strike
dounia
refused
to
hear
anything
and
was
shouting
at
her
for
a
whole
hour
and
then
gave
orders
that
dounia
should
be
packed
off
at
once
to
me
in
a
plain
peasant
s
cart
into
which
they
flung
all
her
things
her
linen
and
her
clothes
all
pell
mell
without
folding
it
up
and
packing
it
and
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
came
on
too
and
dounia
insulted
and
put
to
shame
had
to
drive
with
a
peasant
in
an
open
cart
all
the
seventeen
versts
into
town
only
think
now
what
answer
could
i
have
sent
to
the
letter
i
received
from
you
two
months
ago
and
what
could
i
have
written
i
was
in
despair
i
dared
not
write
to
you
the
truth
because
you
would
have
been
very
unhappy
mortified
and
indignant
and
yet
what
could
you
do
you
could
only
perhaps
ruin
yourself
and
besides
dounia
would
not
allow
it
and
fill
up
my
letter
with
trifles
when
my
heart
was
so
full
of
sorrow
i
could
not
for
a
whole
month
the
town
was
full
of
gossip
about
this
scandal
and
it
came
to
such
a
pass
that
dounia
and
i
dared
not
even
go
to
church
on
account
of
the
contemptuous
looks
whispers
and
even
remarks
made
aloud
about
us
all
our
acquaintances
avoided
us
nobody
even
bowed
to
us
in
the
street
and
i
learnt
that
some
shopmen
and
clerks
were
intending
to
insult
us
in
a
shameful
way
smearing
the
gates
of
our
house
with
pitch
so
that
the
landlord
began
to
tell
us
we
must
leave
all
this
was
set
going
by
marfa
petrovna
who
managed
to
slander
dounia
and
throw
dirt
at
her
in
every
family
she
knows
everyone
in
the
neighbourhood
and
that
month
she
was
continually
coming
into
the
town
and
as
she
is
rather
talkative
and
fond
of
gossiping
about
her
family
affairs
and
particularly
of
complaining
to
all
and
each
of
her
husband
which
is
not
at
all
right
so
in
a
short
time
she
had
spread
her
story
not
only
in
the
town
but
over
the
whole
surrounding
district
it
made
me
ill
but
dounia
bore
it
better
than
i
did
and
if
only
you
could
have
seen
how
she
endured
it
all
and
tried
to
comfort
me
and
cheer
me
up
she
is
an
angel
but
by
god
s
mercy
our
sufferings
were
cut
short
mr
svidriga
lov
returned
to
his
senses
and
repented
and
probably
feeling
sorry
for
dounia
he
laid
before
marfa
petrovna
a
complete
and
unmistakable
proof
of
dounia
s
innocence
in
the
form
of
a
letter
dounia
had
been
forced
to
write
and
give
to
him
before
marfa
petrovna
came
upon
them
in
the
garden
this
letter
which
remained
in
mr
svidriga
lov
s
hands
after
her
departure
she
had
written
to
refuse
personal
explanations
and
secret
interviews
for
which
he
was
entreating
her
in
that
letter
she
reproached
him
with
great
heat
and
indignation
for
the
baseness
of
his
behaviour
in
regard
to
marfa
petrovna
reminding
him
that
he
was
the
father
and
head
of
a
family
and
telling
him
how
infamous
it
was
of
him
to
torment
and
make
unhappy
a
defenceless
girl
unhappy
enough
already
indeed
dear
rodya
the
letter
was
so
nobly
and
touchingly
written
that
i
sobbed
when
i
read
it
and
to
this
day
i
cannot
read
it
without
tears
moreover
the
evidence
of
the
servants
too
cleared
dounia
s
reputation
they
had
seen
and
known
a
great
deal
more
than
mr
svidriga
lov
had
himself
supposed
as
indeed
is
always
the
case
with
servants
marfa
petrovna
was
completely
taken
aback
and
again
crushed
as
she
said
herself
to
us
but
she
was
completely
convinced
of
dounia
s
innocence
the
very
next
day
being
sunday
she
went
straight
to
the
cathedral
knelt
down
and
prayed
with
tears
to
our
lady
to
give
her
strength
to
bear
this
new
trial
and
to
do
her
duty
then
she
came
straight
from
the
cathedral
to
us
told
us
the
whole
story
wept
bitterly
and
fully
penitent
she
embraced
dounia
and
besought
her
to
forgive
her
the
same
morning
without
any
delay
she
went
round
to
all
the
houses
in
the
town
and
everywhere
shedding
tears
she
asserted
in
the
most
flattering
terms
dounia
s
innocence
and
the
nobility
of
her
feelings
and
her
behavior
what
was
more
she
showed
and
read
to
everyone
the
letter
in
dounia
s
own
handwriting
to
mr
svidriga
lov
and
even
allowed
them
to
take
copies
of
it
which
i
must
say
i
think
was
superfluous
in
this
way
she
was
busy
for
several
days
in
driving
about
the
whole
town
because
some
people
had
taken
offence
through
precedence
having
been
given
to
others
and
therefore
they
had
to
take
turns
so
that
in
every
house
she
was
expected
before
she
arrived
and
everyone
knew
that
on
such
and
such
a
day
marfa
petrovna
would
be
reading
the
letter
in
such
and
such
a
place
and
people
assembled
for
every
reading
of
it
even
many
who
had
heard
it
several
times
already
both
in
their
own
houses
and
in
other
people
s
in
my
opinion
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
of
all
this
was
unnecessary
but
that
s
marfa
petrovna
s
character
anyway
she
succeeded
in
completely
re
establishing
dounia
s
reputation
and
the
whole
ignominy
of
this
affair
rested
as
an
indelible
disgrace
upon
her
husband
as
the
only
person
to
blame
so
that
i
really
began
to
feel
sorry
for
him
it
was
really
treating
the
crazy
fellow
too
harshly
dounia
was
at
once
asked
to
give
lessons
in
several
families
but
she
refused
all
of
a
sudden
everyone
began
to
treat
her
with
marked
respect
and
all
this
did
much
to
bring
about
the
event
by
which
one
may
say
our
whole
fortunes
are
now
transformed
you
must
know
dear
rodya
that
dounia
has
a
suitor
and
that
she
has
already
consented
to
marry
him
i
hasten
to
tell
you
all
about
the
matter
and
though
it
has
been
arranged
without
asking
your
consent
i
think
you
will
not
be
aggrieved
with
me
or
with
your
sister
on
that
account
for
you
will
see
that
we
could
not
wait
and
put
off
our
decision
till
we
heard
from
you
and
you
could
not
have
judged
all
the
facts
without
being
on
the
spot
this
was
how
it
happened
he
is
already
of
the
rank
of
a
counsellor
pyotr
petrovitch
luzhin
and
is
distantly
related
to
marfa
petrovna
who
has
been
very
active
in
bringing
the
match
about
it
began
with
his
expressing
through
her
his
desire
to
make
our
acquaintance
he
was
properly
received
drank
coffee
with
us
and
the
very
next
day
he
sent
us
a
letter
in
which
he
very
courteously
made
an
offer
and
begged
for
a
speedy
and
decided
answer
he
is
a
very
busy
man
and
is
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
to
petersburg
so
that
every
moment
is
precious
to
him
at
first
of
course
we
were
greatly
surprised
as
it
had
all
happened
so
quickly
and
unexpectedly
we
thought
and
talked
it
over
the
whole
day
he
is
a
well
to
do
man
to
be
depended
upon
he
has
two
posts
in
the
government
and
has
already
made
his
fortune
it
is
true
that
he
is
forty
five
years
old
but
he
is
of
a
fairly
prepossessing
appearance
and
might
still
be
thought
attractive
by
women
and
he
is
altogether
a
very
respectable
and
presentable
man
only
he
seems
a
little
morose
and
somewhat
conceited
but
possibly
that
may
only
be
the
impression
he
makes
at
first
sight
and
beware
dear
rodya
when
he
comes
to
petersburg
as
he
shortly
will
do
beware
of
judging
him
too
hastily
and
severely
as
your
way
is
if
there
is
anything
you
do
not
like
in
him
at
first
sight
i
give
you
this
warning
although
i
feel
sure
that
he
will
make
a
favourable
impression
upon
you
moreover
in
order
to
understand
any
man
one
must
be
deliberate
and
careful
to
avoid
forming
prejudices
and
mistaken
ideas
which
are
very
difficult
to
correct
and
get
over
afterwards
and
pyotr
petrovitch
judging
by
many
indications
is
a
thoroughly
estimable
man
at
his
first
visit
indeed
he
told
us
that
he
was
a
practical
man
but
still
he
shares
as
he
expressed
it
many
of
the
convictions
of
our
most
rising
generation
and
he
is
an
opponent
of
all
prejudices
he
said
a
good
deal
more
for
he
seems
a
little
conceited
and
likes
to
be
listened
to
but
this
is
scarcely
a
vice
i
of
course
understood
very
little
of
it
but
dounia
explained
to
me
that
though
he
is
not
a
man
of
great
education
he
is
clever
and
seems
to
be
good
natured
you
know
your
sister
s
character
rodya
she
is
a
resolute
sensible
patient
and
generous
girl
but
she
has
a
passionate
heart
as
i
know
very
well
of
course
there
is
no
great
love
either
on
his
side
or
on
hers
but
dounia
is
a
clever
girl
and
has
the
heart
of
an
angel
and
will
make
it
her
duty
to
make
her
husband
happy
who
on
his
side
will
make
her
happiness
his
care
of
that
we
have
no
good
reason
to
doubt
though
it
must
be
admitted
the
matter
has
been
arranged
in
great
haste
besides
he
is
a
man
of
great
prudence
and
he
will
see
to
be
sure
of
himself
that
his
own
happiness
will
be
the
more
secure
the
happier
dounia
is
with
him
and
as
for
some
defects
of
character
for
some
habits
and
even
certain
differences
of
opinion
which
indeed
are
inevitable
even
in
the
happiest
marriages
dounia
has
said
that
as
regards
all
that
she
relies
on
herself
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
uneasy
about
and
that
she
is
ready
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
if
only
their
future
relationship
can
be
an
honourable
and
straightforward
one
he
struck
me
for
instance
at
first
as
rather
abrupt
but
that
may
well
come
from
his
being
an
outspoken
man
and
that
is
no
doubt
how
it
is
for
instance
at
his
second
visit
after
he
had
received
dounia
s
consent
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
declared
that
before
making
dounia
s
acquaintance
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
a
girl
of
good
reputation
without
dowry
and
above
all
one
who
had
experienced
poverty
because
as
he
explained
a
man
ought
not
to
be
indebted
to
his
wife
but
that
it
is
better
for
a
wife
to
look
upon
her
husband
as
her
benefactor
i
must
add
that
he
expressed
it
more
nicely
and
politely
than
i
have
done
for
i
have
forgotten
his
actual
phrases
and
only
remember
the
meaning
and
besides
it
was
obviously
not
said
of
design
but
slipped
out
in
the
heat
of
conversation
so
that
he
tried
afterwards
to
correct
himself
and
smooth
it
over
but
all
the
same
it
did
strike
me
as
somewhat
rude
and
i
said
so
afterwards
to
dounia
but
dounia
was
vexed
and
answered
that
words
are
not
deeds
and
that
of
course
is
perfectly
true
dounia
did
not
sleep
all
night
before
she
made
up
her
mind
and
thinking
that
i
was
asleep
she
got
out
of
bed
and
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
all
night
at
last
she
knelt
down
before
the
ikon
and
prayed
long
and
fervently
and
in
the
morning
she
told
me
that
she
had
decided
i
have
mentioned
already
that
pyotr
petrovitch
is
just
setting
off
for
petersburg
where
he
has
a
great
deal
of
business
and
he
wants
to
open
a
legal
bureau
he
has
been
occupied
for
many
years
in
conducting
civil
and
commercial
litigation
and
only
the
other
day
he
won
an
important
case
he
has
to
be
in
petersburg
because
he
has
an
important
case
before
the
senate
so
rodya
dear
he
may
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
you
in
every
way
indeed
and
dounia
and
i
have
agreed
that
from
this
very
day
you
could
definitely
enter
upon
your
career
and
might
consider
that
your
future
is
marked
out
and
assured
for
you
oh
if
only
this
comes
to
pass
this
would
be
such
a
benefit
that
we
could
only
look
upon
it
as
a
providential
blessing
dounia
is
dreaming
of
nothing
else
we
have
even
ventured
already
to
drop
a
few
words
on
the
subject
to
pyotr
petrovitch
he
was
cautious
in
his
answer
and
said
that
of
course
as
he
could
not
get
on
without
a
secretary
it
would
be
better
to
be
paying
a
salary
to
a
relation
than
to
a
stranger
if
only
the
former
were
fitted
for
the
duties
as
though
there
could
be
doubt
of
your
being
fitted
but
then
he
expressed
doubts
whether
your
studies
at
the
university
would
leave
you
time
for
work
at
his
office
the
matter
dropped
for
the
time
but
dounia
is
thinking
of
nothing
else
now
she
has
been
in
a
sort
of
fever
for
the
last
few
days
and
has
already
made
a
regular
plan
for
your
becoming
in
the
end
an
associate
and
even
a
partner
in
pyotr
petrovitch
s
business
which
might
well
be
seeing
that
you
are
a
student
of
law
i
am
in
complete
agreement
with
her
rodya
and
share
all
her
plans
and
hopes
and
think
there
is
every
probability
of
realising
them
and
in
spite
of
pyotr
petrovitch
s
evasiveness
very
natural
at
present
since
he
does
not
know
you
dounia
is
firmly
persuaded
that
she
will
gain
everything
by
her
good
influence
over
her
future
husband
this
she
is
reckoning
upon
of
course
we
are
careful
not
to
talk
of
any
of
these
more
remote
plans
to
pyotr
petrovitch
especially
of
your
becoming
his
partner
he
is
a
practical
man
and
might
take
this
very
coldly
it
might
all
seem
to
him
simply
a
day
dream
nor
has
either
dounia
or
i
breathed
a
word
to
him
of
the
great
hopes
we
have
of
his
helping
us
to
pay
for
your
university
studies
we
have
not
spoken
of
it
in
the
first
place
because
it
will
come
to
pass
of
itself
later
on
and
he
will
no
doubt
without
wasting
words
offer
to
do
it
of
himself
as
though
he
could
refuse
dounia
that
the
more
readily
since
you
may
by
your
own
efforts
become
his
right
hand
in
the
office
and
receive
this
assistance
not
as
a
charity
but
as
a
salary
earned
by
your
own
work
dounia
wants
to
arrange
it
all
like
this
and
i
quite
agree
with
her
and
we
have
not
spoken
of
our
plans
for
another
reason
that
is
because
i
particularly
wanted
you
to
feel
on
an
equal
footing
when
you
first
meet
him
when
dounia
spoke
to
him
with
enthusiasm
about
you
he
answered
that
one
could
never
judge
of
a
man
without
seeing
him
close
for
oneself
and
that
he
looked
forward
to
forming
his
own
opinion
when
he
makes
your
acquaintance
do
you
know
my
precious
rodya
i
think
that
perhaps
for
some
reasons
nothing
to
do
with
pyotr
petrovitch
though
simply
for
my
own
personal
perhaps
old
womanish
fancies
i
should
do
better
to
go
on
living
by
myself
apart
than
with
them
after
the
wedding
i
am
convinced
that
he
will
be
generous
and
delicate
enough
to
invite
me
and
to
urge
me
to
remain
with
my
daughter
for
the
future
and
if
he
has
said
nothing
about
it
hitherto
it
is
simply
because
it
has
been
taken
for
granted
but
i
shall
refuse
i
have
noticed
more
than
once
in
my
life
that
husbands
don
t
quite
get
on
with
their
mothers
in
law
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
the
least
bit
in
anyone
s
way
and
for
my
own
sake
too
would
rather
be
quite
independent
so
long
as
i
have
a
crust
of
bread
of
my
own
and
such
children
as
you
and
dounia
if
possible
i
would
settle
somewhere
near
you
for
the
most
joyful
piece
of
news
dear
rodya
i
have
kept
for
the
end
of
my
letter
know
then
my
dear
boy
that
we
may
perhaps
be
all
together
in
a
very
short
time
and
may
embrace
one
another
again
after
a
separation
of
almost
three
years
it
is
settled
for
certain
that
dounia
and
i
are
to
set
off
for
petersburg
exactly
when
i
don
t
know
but
very
very
soon
possibly
in
a
week
it
all
depends
on
pyotr
petrovitch
who
will
let
us
know
when
he
has
had
time
to
look
round
him
in
petersburg
to
suit
his
own
arrangements
he
is
anxious
to
have
the
ceremony
as
soon
as
possible
even
before
the
fast
of
our
lady
if
it
could
be
managed
or
if
that
is
too
soon
to
be
ready
immediately
after
oh
with
what
happiness
i
shall
press
you
to
my
heart
dounia
is
all
excitement
at
the
joyful
thought
of
seeing
you
she
said
one
day
in
joke
that
she
would
be
ready
to
marry
pyotr
petrovitch
for
that
alone
she
is
an
angel
she
is
not
writing
anything
to
you
now
and
has
only
told
me
to
write
that
she
has
so
much
so
much
to
tell
you
that
she
is
not
going
to
take
up
her
pen
now
for
a
few
lines
would
tell
you
nothing
and
it
would
only
mean
upsetting
herself
she
bids
me
send
you
her
love
and
innumerable
kisses
but
although
we
shall
be
meeting
so
soon
perhaps
i
shall
send
you
as
much
money
as
i
can
in
a
day
or
two
now
that
everyone
has
heard
that
dounia
is
to
marry
pyotr
petrovitch
my
credit
has
suddenly
improved
and
i
know
that
afanasy
ivanovitch
will
trust
me
now
even
to
seventy
five
roubles
on
the
security
of
my
pension
so
that
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
send
you
twenty
five
or
even
thirty
roubles
i
would
send
you
more
but
i
am
uneasy
about
our
travelling
expenses
for
though
pyotr
petrovitch
has
been
so
kind
as
to
undertake
part
of
the
expenses
of
the
journey
that
is
to
say
he
has
taken
upon
himself
the
conveyance
of
our
bags
and
big
trunk
which
will
be
conveyed
through
some
acquaintances
of
his
we
must
reckon
upon
some
expense
on
our
arrival
in
petersburg
where
we
can
t
be
left
without
a
halfpenny
at
least
for
the
first
few
days
but
we
have
calculated
it
all
dounia
and
i
to
the
last
penny
and
we
see
that
the
journey
will
not
cost
very
much
it
is
only
ninety
versts
from
us
to
the
railway
and
we
have
come
to
an
agreement
with
a
driver
we
know
so
as
to
be
in
readiness
and
from
there
dounia
and
i
can
travel
quite
comfortably
third
class
so
that
i
may
very
likely
be
able
to
send
to
you
not
twenty
five
but
thirty
roubles
but
enough
i
have
covered
two
sheets
already
and
there
is
no
space
left
for
more
our
whole
history
but
so
many
events
have
happened
and
now
my
precious
rodya
i
embrace
you
and
send
you
a
mother
s
blessing
till
we
meet
love
dounia
your
sister
rodya
love
her
as
she
loves
you
and
understand
that
she
loves
you
beyond
everything
more
than
herself
she
is
an
angel
and
you
rodya
you
are
everything
to
us
our
one
hope
our
one
consolation
if
only
you
are
happy
we
shall
be
happy
do
you
still
say
your
prayers
rodya
and
believe
in
the
mercy
of
our
creator
and
our
redeemer
i
am
afraid
in
my
heart
that
you
may
have
been
visited
by
the
new
spirit
of
infidelity
that
is
abroad
to
day
if
it
is
so
i
pray
for
you
remember
dear
boy
how
in
your
childhood
when
your
father
was
living
you
used
to
lisp
your
prayers
at
my
knee
and
how
happy
we
all
were
in
those
days
good
bye
till
we
meet
then
i
embrace
you
warmly
warmly
with
many
kisses
yours
till
death
pulcheria
raskolnikov
almost
from
the
first
while
he
read
the
letter
raskolnikov
s
face
was
wet
with
tears
but
when
he
finished
it
his
face
was
pale
and
distorted
and
a
bitter
wrathful
and
malignant
smile
was
on
his
lips
he
laid
his
head
down
on
his
threadbare
dirty
pillow
and
pondered
pondered
a
long
time
his
heart
was
beating
violently
and
his
brain
was
in
a
turmoil
at
last
he
felt
cramped
and
stifled
in
the
little
yellow
room
that
was
like
a
cupboard
or
a
box
his
eyes
and
his
mind
craved
for
space
he
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
this
time
without
dread
of
meeting
anyone
he
had
forgotten
his
dread
he
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
vassilyevsky
ostrov
walking
along
vassilyevsky
prospect
as
though
hastening
on
some
business
but
he
walked
as
his
habit
was
without
noticing
his
way
muttering
and
even
speaking
aloud
to
himself
to
the
astonishment
of
the
passers
by
many
of
them
took
him
to
be
drunk
chapter
iv
his
mother
s
letter
had
been
a
torture
to
him
but
as
regards
the
chief
fact
in
it
he
had
felt
not
one
moment
s
hesitation
even
whilst
he
was
reading
the
letter
the
essential
question
was
settled
and
irrevocably
settled
in
his
mind
never
such
a
marriage
while
i
am
alive
and
mr
luzhin
be
damned
the
thing
is
perfectly
clear
he
muttered
to
himself
with
a
malignant
smile
anticipating
the
triumph
of
his
decision
no
mother
no
dounia
you
won
t
deceive
me
and
then
they
apologise
for
not
asking
my
advice
and
for
taking
the
decision
without
me
i
dare
say
they
imagine
it
is
arranged
now
and
can
t
be
broken
off
but
we
will
see
whether
it
can
or
not
a
magnificent
excuse
pyotr
petrovitch
is
such
a
busy
man
that
even
his
wedding
has
to
be
in
post
haste
almost
by
express
no
dounia
i
see
it
all
and
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
to
me
and
i
know
too
what
you
were
thinking
about
when
you
walked
up
and
down
all
night
and
what
your
prayers
were
like
before
the
holy
mother
of
kazan
who
stands
in
mother
s
bedroom
bitter
is
the
ascent
to
golgotha
hm
so
it
is
finally
settled
you
have
determined
to
marry
a
sensible
business
man
avdotya
romanovna
one
who
has
a
fortune
has
already
made
his
fortune
that
is
so
much
more
solid
and
impressive
a
man
who
holds
two
government
posts
and
who
shares
the
ideas
of
our
most
rising
generation
as
mother
writes
and
who
seems
to
be
kind
as
dounia
herself
observes
that
seems
beats
everything
and
that
very
dounia
for
that
very
seems
is
marrying
him
splendid
splendid
but
i
should
like
to
know
why
mother
has
written
to
me
about
our
most
rising
generation
simply
as
a
descriptive
touch
or
with
the
idea
of
prepossessing
me
in
favour
of
mr
luzhin
oh
the
cunning
of
them
i
should
like
to
know
one
thing
more
how
far
they
were
open
with
one
another
that
day
and
night
and
all
this
time
since
was
it
all
put
into
words
or
did
both
understand
that
they
had
the
same
thing
at
heart
and
in
their
minds
so
that
there
was
no
need
to
speak
of
it
aloud
and
better
not
to
speak
of
it
most
likely
it
was
partly
like
that
from
mother
s
letter
it
s
evident
he
struck
her
as
rude
a
little
and
mother
in
her
simplicity
took
her
observations
to
dounia
and
she
was
sure
to
be
vexed
and
answered
her
angrily
i
should
think
so
who
would
not
be
angered
when
it
was
quite
clear
without
any
na
ve
questions
and
when
it
was
understood
that
it
was
useless
to
discuss
it
and
why
does
she
write
to
me
love
dounia
rodya
and
she
loves
you
more
than
herself
has
she
a
secret
conscience
prick
at
sacrificing
her
daughter
to
her
son
you
are
our
one
comfort
you
are
everything
to
us
oh
mother
his
bitterness
grew
more
and
more
intense
and
if
he
had
happened
to
meet
mr
luzhin
at
the
moment
he
might
have
murdered
him
hm
yes
that
s
true
he
continued
pursuing
the
whirling
ideas
that
chased
each
other
in
his
brain
it
is
true
that
it
needs
time
and
care
to
get
to
know
a
man
but
there
is
no
mistake
about
mr
luzhin
the
chief
thing
is
he
is
a
man
of
business
and
seems
kind
that
was
something
wasn
t
it
to
send
the
bags
and
big
box
for
them
a
kind
man
no
doubt
after
that
but
his
bride
and
her
mother
are
to
drive
in
a
peasant
s
cart
covered
with
sacking
i
know
i
have
been
driven
in
it
no
matter
it
is
only
ninety
versts
and
then
they
can
travel
very
comfortably
third
class
for
a
thousand
versts
quite
right
too
one
must
cut
one
s
coat
according
to
one
s
cloth
but
what
about
you
mr
luzhin
she
is
your
bride
and
you
must
be
aware
that
her
mother
has
to
raise
money
on
her
pension
for
the
journey
to
be
sure
it
s
a
matter
of
business
a
partnership
for
mutual
benefit
with
equal
shares
and
expenses
food
and
drink
provided
but
pay
for
your
tobacco
the
business
man
has
got
the
better
of
them
too
the
luggage
will
cost
less
than
their
fares
and
very
likely
go
for
nothing
how
is
it
that
they
don
t
both
see
all
that
or
is
it
that
they
don
t
want
to
see
and
they
are
pleased
pleased
and
to
think
that
this
is
only
the
first
blossoming
and
that
the
real
fruits
are
to
come
but
what
really
matters
is
not
the
stinginess
is
not
the
meanness
but
the
tone
of
the
whole
thing
for
that
will
be
the
tone
after
marriage
it
s
a
foretaste
of
it
and
mother
too
why
should
she
be
so
lavish
what
will
she
have
by
the
time
she
gets
to
petersburg
three
silver
roubles
or
two
paper
ones
as
she
says
that
old
woman
hm
what
does
she
expect
to
live
upon
in
petersburg
afterwards
she
has
her
reasons
already
for
guessing
that
she
could
not
live
with
dounia
after
the
marriage
even
for
the
first
few
months
the
good
man
has
no
doubt
let
slip
something
on
that
subject
also
though
mother
would
deny
it
i
shall
refuse
says
she
on
whom
is
she
reckoning
then
is
she
counting
on
what
is
left
of
her
hundred
and
twenty
roubles
of
pension
when
afanasy
ivanovitch
s
debt
is
paid
she
knits
woollen
shawls
and
embroiders
cuffs
ruining
her
old
eyes
and
all
her
shawls
don
t
add
more
than
twenty
roubles
a
year
to
her
hundred
and
twenty
i
know
that
so
she
is
building
all
her
hopes
all
the
time
on
mr
luzhin
s
generosity
he
will
offer
it
of
himself
he
will
press
it
on
me
you
may
wait
a
long
time
for
that
that
s
how
it
always
is
with
these
schilleresque
noble
hearts
till
the
last
moment
every
goose
is
a
swan
with
them
till
the
last
moment
they
hope
for
the
best
and
will
see
nothing
wrong
and
although
they
have
an
inkling
of
the
other
side
of
the
picture
yet
they
won
t
face
the
truth
till
they
are
forced
to
the
very
thought
of
it
makes
them
shiver
they
thrust
the
truth
away
with
both
hands
until
the
man
they
deck
out
in
false
colours
puts
a
fool
s
cap
on
them
with
his
own
hands
i
should
like
to
know
whether
mr
luzhin
has
any
orders
of
merit
i
bet
he
has
the
anna
in
his
buttonhole
and
that
he
puts
it
on
when
he
goes
to
dine
with
contractors
or
merchants
he
will
be
sure
to
have
it
for
his
wedding
too
enough
of
him
confound
him
well
mother
i
don
t
wonder
at
it
s
like
her
god
bless
her
but
how
could
dounia
dounia
darling
as
though
i
did
not
know
you
you
were
nearly
twenty
when
i
saw
you
last
i
understood
you
then
mother
writes
that
dounia
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
i
know
that
very
well
i
knew
that
two
years
and
a
half
ago
and
for
the
last
two
and
a
half
years
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
thinking
of
just
that
that
dounia
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
if
she
could
put
up
with
mr
svidriga
lov
and
all
the
rest
of
it
she
certainly
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
and
now
mother
and
she
have
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
she
can
put
up
with
mr
luzhin
who
propounds
the
theory
of
the
superiority
of
wives
raised
from
destitution
and
owing
everything
to
their
husband
s
bounty
who
propounds
it
too
almost
at
the
first
interview
granted
that
he
let
it
slip
though
he
is
a
sensible
man
yet
maybe
it
was
not
a
slip
at
all
but
he
meant
to
make
himself
clear
as
soon
as
possible
but
dounia
dounia
she
understands
the
man
of
course
but
she
will
have
to
live
with
the
man
why
she
d
live
on
black
bread
and
water
she
would
not
sell
her
soul
she
would
not
barter
her
moral
freedom
for
comfort
she
would
not
barter
it
for
all
schleswig
holstein
much
less
mr
luzhin
s
money
no
dounia
was
not
that
sort
when
i
knew
her
and
she
is
still
the
same
of
course
yes
there
s
no
denying
the
svidriga
lovs
are
a
bitter
pill
it
s
a
bitter
thing
to
spend
one
s
life
a
governess
in
the
provinces
for
two
hundred
roubles
but
i
know
she
would
rather
be
a
nigger
on
a
plantation
or
a
lett
with
a
german
master
than
degrade
her
soul
and
her
moral
dignity
by
binding
herself
for
ever
to
a
man
whom
she
does
not
respect
and
with
whom
she
has
nothing
in
common
for
her
own
advantage
and
if
mr
luzhin
had
been
of
unalloyed
gold
or
one
huge
diamond
she
would
never
have
consented
to
become
his
legal
concubine
why
is
she
consenting
then
what
s
the
point
of
it
what
s
the
answer
it
s
clear
enough
for
herself
for
her
comfort
to
save
her
life
she
would
not
sell
herself
but
for
someone
else
she
is
doing
it
for
one
she
loves
for
one
she
adores
she
will
sell
herself
that
s
what
it
all
amounts
to
for
her
brother
for
her
mother
she
will
sell
herself
she
will
sell
everything
in
such
cases
we
overcome
our
moral
feeling
if
necessary
freedom
peace
conscience
even
all
all
are
brought
into
the
market
let
my
life
go
if
only
my
dear
ones
may
be
happy
more
than
that
we
become
casuists
we
learn
to
be
jesuitical
and
for
a
time
maybe
we
can
soothe
ourselves
we
can
persuade
ourselves
that
it
is
one
s
duty
for
a
good
object
that
s
just
like
us
it
s
as
clear
as
daylight
it
s
clear
that
rodion
romanovitch
raskolnikov
is
the
central
figure
in
the
business
and
no
one
else
oh
yes
she
can
ensure
his
happiness
keep
him
in
the
university
make
him
a
partner
in
the
office
make
his
whole
future
secure
perhaps
he
may
even
be
a
rich
man
later
on
prosperous
respected
and
may
even
end
his
life
a
famous
man
but
my
mother
it
s
all
rodya
precious
rodya
her
first
born
for
such
a
son
who
would
not
sacrifice
such
a
daughter
oh
loving
over
partial
hearts
why
for
his
sake
we
would
not
shrink
even
from
sonia
s
fate
sonia
sonia
marmeladov
the
eternal
victim
so
long
as
the
world
lasts
have
you
taken
the
measure
of
your
sacrifice
both
of
you
is
it
right
can
you
bear
it
is
it
any
use
is
there
sense
in
it
and
let
me
tell
you
dounia
sonia
s
life
is
no
worse
than
life
with
mr
luzhin
there
can
be
no
question
of
love
mother
writes
and
what
if
there
can
be
no
respect
either
if
on
the
contrary
there
is
aversion
contempt
repulsion
what
then
so
you
will
have
to
keep
up
your
appearance
too
is
not
that
so
do
you
understand
what
that
smartness
means
do
you
understand
that
the
luzhin
smartness
is
just
the
same
thing
as
sonia
s
and
may
be
worse
viler
baser
because
in
your
case
dounia
it
s
a
bargain
for
luxuries
after
all
but
with
sonia
it
s
simply
a
question
of
starvation
it
has
to
be
paid
for
it
has
to
be
paid
for
dounia
this
smartness
and
what
if
it
s
more
than
you
can
bear
afterwards
if
you
regret
it
the
bitterness
the
misery
the
curses
the
tears
hidden
from
all
the
world
for
you
are
not
a
marfa
petrovna
and
how
will
your
mother
feel
then
even
now
she
is
uneasy
she
is
worried
but
then
when
she
sees
it
all
clearly
and
i
yes
indeed
what
have
you
taken
me
for
i
won
t
have
your
sacrifice
dounia
i
won
t
have
it
mother
it
shall
not
be
so
long
as
i
am
alive
it
shall
not
it
shall
not
i
won
t
accept
it
he
suddenly
paused
in
his
reflection
and
stood
still
it
shall
not
be
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
prevent
it
you
ll
forbid
it
and
what
right
have
you
what
can
you
promise
them
on
your
side
to
give
you
such
a
right
your
whole
life
your
whole
future
you
will
devote
to
them
when
you
have
finished
your
studies
and
obtained
a
post
yes
we
have
heard
all
that
before
and
that
s
all
words
but
now
now
something
must
be
done
now
do
you
understand
that
and
what
are
you
doing
now
you
are
living
upon
them
they
borrow
on
their
hundred
roubles
pension
they
borrow
from
the
svidriga
lovs
how
are
you
going
to
save
them
from
svidriga
lovs
from
afanasy
ivanovitch
vahrushin
oh
future
millionaire
zeus
who
would
arrange
their
lives
for
them
in
another
ten
years
in
another
ten
years
mother
will
be
blind
with
knitting
shawls
maybe
with
weeping
too
she
will
be
worn
to
a
shadow
with
fasting
and
my
sister
imagine
for
a
moment
what
may
have
become
of
your
sister
in
ten
years
what
may
happen
to
her
during
those
ten
years
can
you
fancy
so
he
tortured
himself
fretting
himself
with
such
questions
and
finding
a
kind
of
enjoyment
in
it
and
yet
all
these
questions
were
not
new
ones
suddenly
confronting
him
they
were
old
familiar
aches
it
was
long
since
they
had
first
begun
to
grip
and
rend
his
heart
long
long
ago
his
present
anguish
had
its
first
beginnings
it
had
waxed
and
gathered
strength
it
had
matured
and
concentrated
until
it
had
taken
the
form
of
a
fearful
frenzied
and
fantastic
question
which
tortured
his
heart
and
mind
clamouring
insistently
for
an
answer
now
his
mother
s
letter
had
burst
on
him
like
a
thunderclap
it
was
clear
that
he
must
not
now
suffer
passively
worrying
himself
over
unsolved
questions
but
that
he
must
do
something
do
it
at
once
and
do
it
quickly
anyway
he
must
decide
on
something
or
else
or
throw
up
life
altogether
he
cried
suddenly
in
a
frenzy
accept
one
s
lot
humbly
as
it
is
once
for
all
and
stifle
everything
in
oneself
giving
up
all
claim
to
activity
life
and
love
do
you
understand
sir
do
you
understand
what
it
means
when
you
have
absolutely
nowhere
to
turn
marmeladov
s
question
came
suddenly
into
his
mind
for
every
man
must
have
somewhere
to
turn
he
gave
a
sudden
start
another
thought
that
he
had
had
yesterday
slipped
back
into
his
mind
but
he
did
not
start
at
the
thought
recurring
to
him
for
he
knew
he
had
felt
beforehand
that
it
must
come
back
he
was
expecting
it
besides
it
was
not
only
yesterday
s
thought
the
difference
was
that
a
month
ago
yesterday
even
the
thought
was
a
mere
dream
but
now
now
it
appeared
not
a
dream
at
all
it
had
taken
a
new
menacing
and
quite
unfamiliar
shape
and
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
this
himself
he
felt
a
hammering
in
his
head
and
there
was
a
darkness
before
his
eyes
he
looked
round
hurriedly
he
was
searching
for
something
he
wanted
to
sit
down
and
was
looking
for
a
seat
he
was
walking
along
the
k
boulevard
there
was
a
seat
about
a
hundred
paces
in
front
of
him
he
walked
towards
it
as
fast
he
could
but
on
the
way
he
met
with
a
little
adventure
which
absorbed
all
his
attention
looking
for
the
seat
he
had
noticed
a
woman
walking
some
twenty
paces
in
front
of
him
but
at
first
he
took
no
more
notice
of
her
than
of
other
objects
that
crossed
his
path
it
had
happened
to
him
many
times
going
home
not
to
notice
the
road
by
which
he
was
going
and
he
was
accustomed
to
walk
like
that
but
there
was
at
first
sight
something
so
strange
about
the
woman
in
front
of
him
that
gradually
his
attention
was
riveted
upon
her
at
first
reluctantly
and
as
it
were
resentfully
and
then
more
and
more
intently
he
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
find
out
what
it
was
that
was
so
strange
about
the
woman
in
the
first
place
she
appeared
to
be
a
girl
quite
young
and
she
was
walking
in
the
great
heat
bareheaded
and
with
no
parasol
or
gloves
waving
her
arms
about
in
an
absurd
way
she
had
on
a
dress
of
some
light
silky
material
but
put
on
strangely
awry
not
properly
hooked
up
and
torn
open
at
the
top
of
the
skirt
close
to
the
waist
a
great
piece
was
rent
and
hanging
loose
a
little
kerchief
was
flung
about
her
bare
throat
but
lay
slanting
on
one
side
the
girl
was
walking
unsteadily
too
stumbling
and
staggering
from
side
to
side
she
drew
raskolnikov
s
whole
attention
at
last
he
overtook
the
girl
at
the
seat
but
on
reaching
it
she
dropped
down
on
it
in
the
corner
she
let
her
head
sink
on
the
back
of
the
seat
and
closed
her
eyes
apparently
in
extreme
exhaustion
looking
at
her
closely
he
saw
at
once
that
she
was
completely
drunk
it
was
a
strange
and
shocking
sight
he
could
hardly
believe
that
he
was
not
mistaken
he
saw
before
him
the
face
of
a
quite
young
fair
haired
girl
sixteen
perhaps
not
more
than
fifteen
years
old
pretty
little
face
but
flushed
and
heavy
looking
and
as
it
were
swollen
the
girl
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
she
was
doing
she
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
lifting
it
indecorously
and
showed
every
sign
of
being
unconscious
that
she
was
in
the
street
raskolnikov
did
not
sit
down
but
he
felt
unwilling
to
leave
her
and
stood
facing
her
in
perplexity
this
boulevard
was
never
much
frequented
and
now
at
two
o
clock
in
the
stifling
heat
it
was
quite
deserted
and
yet
on
the
further
side
of
the
boulevard
about
fifteen
paces
away
a
gentleman
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
he
too
would
apparently
have
liked
to
approach
the
girl
with
some
object
of
his
own
he
too
had
probably
seen
her
in
the
distance
and
had
followed
her
but
found
raskolnikov
in
his
way
he
looked
angrily
at
him
though
he
tried
to
escape
his
notice
and
stood
impatiently
biding
his
time
till
the
unwelcome
man
in
rags
should
have
moved
away
his
intentions
were
unmistakable
the
gentleman
was
a
plump
thickly
set
man
about
thirty
fashionably
dressed
with
a
high
colour
red
lips
and
moustaches
raskolnikov
felt
furious
he
had
a
sudden
longing
to
insult
this
fat
dandy
in
some
way
he
left
the
girl
for
a
moment
and
walked
towards
the
gentleman
hey
you
svidriga
lov
what
do
you
want
here
he
shouted
clenching
his
fists
and
laughing
spluttering
with
rage
what
do
you
mean
the
gentleman
asked
sternly
scowling
in
haughty
astonishment
get
away
that
s
what
i
mean
how
dare
you
you
low
fellow
he
raised
his
cane
raskolnikov
rushed
at
him
with
his
fists
without
reflecting
that
the
stout
gentleman
was
a
match
for
two
men
like
himself
but
at
that
instant
someone
seized
him
from
behind
and
a
police
constable
stood
between
them
that
s
enough
gentlemen
no
fighting
please
in
a
public
place
what
do
you
want
who
are
you
he
asked
raskolnikov
sternly
noticing
his
rags
raskolnikov
looked
at
him
intently
he
had
a
straight
forward
sensible
soldierly
face
with
grey
moustaches
and
whiskers
you
are
just
the
man
i
want
raskolnikov
cried
catching
at
his
arm
i
am
a
student
raskolnikov
you
may
as
well
know
that
too
he
added
addressing
the
gentleman
come
along
i
have
something
to
show
you
and
taking
the
policeman
by
the
hand
he
drew
him
towards
the
seat
look
here
hopelessly
drunk
and
she
has
just
come
down
the
boulevard
there
is
no
telling
who
and
what
she
is
she
does
not
look
like
a
professional
it
s
more
likely
she
has
been
given
drink
and
deceived
somewhere
for
the
first
time
you
understand
and
they
ve
put
her
out
into
the
street
like
that
look
at
the
way
her
dress
is
torn
and
the
way
it
has
been
put
on
she
has
been
dressed
by
somebody
she
has
not
dressed
herself
and
dressed
by
unpractised
hands
by
a
man
s
hands
that
s
evident
and
now
look
there
i
don
t
know
that
dandy
with
whom
i
was
going
to
fight
i
see
him
for
the
first
time
but
he
too
has
seen
her
on
the
road
just
now
drunk
not
knowing
what
she
is
doing
and
now
he
is
very
eager
to
get
hold
of
her
to
get
her
away
somewhere
while
she
is
in
this
state
that
s
certain
believe
me
i
am
not
wrong
i
saw
him
myself
watching
her
and
following
her
but
i
prevented
him
and
he
is
just
waiting
for
me
to
go
away
now
he
has
walked
away
a
little
and
is
standing
still
pretending
to
make
a
cigarette
think
how
can
we
keep
her
out
of
his
hands
and
how
are
we
to
get
her
home
the
policeman
saw
it
all
in
a
flash
the
stout
gentleman
was
easy
to
understand
he
turned
to
consider
the
girl
the
policeman
bent
over
to
examine
her
more
closely
and
his
face
worked
with
genuine
compassion
ah
what
a
pity
he
said
shaking
his
head
why
she
is
quite
a
child
she
has
been
deceived
you
can
see
that
at
once
listen
lady
he
began
addressing
her
where
do
you
live
the
girl
opened
her
weary
and
sleepy
looking
eyes
gazed
blankly
at
the
speaker
and
waved
her
hand
here
said
raskolnikov
feeling
in
his
pocket
and
finding
twenty
copecks
here
call
a
cab
and
tell
him
to
drive
her
to
her
address
the
only
thing
is
to
find
out
her
address
missy
missy
the
policeman
began
again
taking
the
money
i
ll
fetch
you
a
cab
and
take
you
home
myself
where
shall
i
take
you
eh
where
do
you
live
go
away
they
won
t
let
me
alone
the
girl
muttered
and
once
more
waved
her
hand
ach
ach
how
shocking
it
s
shameful
missy
it
s
a
shame
he
shook
his
head
again
shocked
sympathetic
and
indignant
it
s
a
difficult
job
the
policeman
said
to
raskolnikov
and
as
he
did
so
he
looked
him
up
and
down
in
a
rapid
glance
he
too
must
have
seemed
a
strange
figure
to
him
dressed
in
rags
and
handing
him
money
did
you
meet
her
far
from
here
he
asked
him
i
tell
you
she
was
walking
in
front
of
me
staggering
just
here
in
the
boulevard
she
only
just
reached
the
seat
and
sank
down
on
it
ah
the
shameful
things
that
are
done
in
the
world
nowadays
god
have
mercy
on
us
an
innocent
creature
like
that
drunk
already
she
has
been
deceived
that
s
a
sure
thing
see
how
her
dress
has
been
torn
too
ah
the
vice
one
sees
nowadays
and
as
likely
as
not
she
belongs
to
gentlefolk
too
poor
ones
maybe
there
are
many
like
that
nowadays
she
looks
refined
too
as
though
she
were
a
lady
and
he
bent
over
her
once
more
perhaps
he
had
daughters
growing
up
like
that
looking
like
ladies
and
refined
with
pretensions
to
gentility
and
smartness
the
chief
thing
is
raskolnikov
persisted
to
keep
her
out
of
this
scoundrel
s
hands
why
should
he
outrage
her
it
s
as
clear
as
day
what
he
is
after
ah
the
brute
he
is
not
moving
off
raskolnikov
spoke
aloud
and
pointed
to
him
the
gentleman
heard
him
and
seemed
about
to
fly
into
a
rage
again
but
thought
better
of
it
and
confined
himself
to
a
contemptuous
look
he
then
walked
slowly
another
ten
paces
away
and
again
halted
keep
her
out
of
his
hands
we
can
said
the
constable
thoughtfully
if
only
she
d
tell
us
where
to
take
her
but
as
it
is
missy
hey
missy
he
bent
over
her
once
more
she
opened
her
eyes
fully
all
of
a
sudden
looked
at
him
intently
as
though
realising
something
got
up
from
the
seat
and
walked
away
in
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
oh
shameful
wretches
they
won
t
let
me
alone
she
said
waving
her
hand
again
she
walked
quickly
though
staggering
as
before
the
dandy
followed
her
but
along
another
avenue
keeping
his
eye
on
her
don
t
be
anxious
i
won
t
let
him
have
her
the
policeman
said
resolutely
and
he
set
off
after
them
ah
the
vice
one
sees
nowadays
he
repeated
aloud
sighing
at
that
moment
something
seemed
to
sting
raskolnikov
in
an
instant
a
complete
revulsion
of
feeling
came
over
him
hey
here
he
shouted
after
the
policeman
the
latter
turned
round
let
them
be
what
is
it
to
do
with
you
let
her
go
let
him
amuse
himself
he
pointed
at
the
dandy
what
is
it
to
do
with
you
the
policeman
was
bewildered
and
stared
at
him
open
eyed
raskolnikov
laughed
well
ejaculated
the
policeman
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
and
he
walked
after
the
dandy
and
the
girl
probably
taking
raskolnikov
for
a
madman
or
something
even
worse
he
has
carried
off
my
twenty
copecks
raskolnikov
murmured
angrily
when
he
was
left
alone
well
let
him
take
as
much
from
the
other
fellow
to
allow
him
to
have
the
girl
and
so
let
it
end
and
why
did
i
want
to
interfere
is
it
for
me
to
help
have
i
any
right
to
help
let
them
devour
each
other
alive
what
is
to
me
how
did
i
dare
to
give
him
twenty
copecks
were
they
mine
in
spite
of
those
strange
words
he
felt
very
wretched
he
sat
down
on
the
deserted
seat
his
thoughts
strayed
aimlessly
he
found
it
hard
to
fix
his
mind
on
anything
at
that
moment
he
longed
to
forget
himself
altogether
to
forget
everything
and
then
to
wake
up
and
begin
life
anew
poor
girl
he
said
looking
at
the
empty
corner
where
she
had
sat
she
will
come
to
herself
and
weep
and
then
her
mother
will
find
out
she
will
give
her
a
beating
a
horrible
shameful
beating
and
then
maybe
turn
her
out
of
doors
and
even
if
she
does
not
the
darya
frantsovnas
will
get
wind
of
it
and
the
girl
will
soon
be
slipping
out
on
the
sly
here
and
there
then
there
will
be
the
hospital
directly
that
s
always
the
luck
of
those
girls
with
respectable
mothers
who
go
wrong
on
the
sly
and
then
again
the
hospital
drink
the
taverns
and
more
hospital
in
two
or
three
years
a
wreck
and
her
life
over
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
have
not
i
seen
cases
like
that
and
how
have
they
been
brought
to
it
why
they
ve
all
come
to
it
like
that
ugh
but
what
does
it
matter
that
s
as
it
should
be
they
tell
us
a
certain
percentage
they
tell
us
must
every
year
go
that
way
to
the
devil
i
suppose
so
that
the
rest
may
remain
chaste
and
not
be
interfered
with
a
percentage
what
splendid
words
they
have
they
are
so
scientific
so
consolatory
once
you
ve
said
percentage
there
s
nothing
more
to
worry
about
if
we
had
any
other
word
maybe
we
might
feel
more
uneasy
but
what
if
dounia
were
one
of
the
percentage
of
another
one
if
not
that
one
but
where
am
i
going
he
thought
suddenly
strange
i
came
out
for
something
as
soon
as
i
had
read
the
letter
i
came
out
i
was
going
to
vassilyevsky
ostrov
to
razumihin
that
s
what
it
was
now
i
remember
what
for
though
and
what
put
the
idea
of
going
to
razumihin
into
my
head
just
now
that
s
curious
he
wondered
at
himself
razumihin
was
one
of
his
old
comrades
at
the
university
it
was
remarkable
that
raskolnikov
had
hardly
any
friends
at
the
university
he
kept
aloof
from
everyone
went
to
see
no
one
and
did
not
welcome
anyone
who
came
to
see
him
and
indeed
everyone
soon
gave
him
up
he
took
no
part
in
the
students
gatherings
amusements
or
conversations
he
worked
with
great
intensity
without
sparing
himself
and
he
was
respected
for
this
but
no
one
liked
him
he
was
very
poor
and
there
was
a
sort
of
haughty
pride
and
reserve
about
him
as
though
he
were
keeping
something
to
himself
he
seemed
to
some
of
his
comrades
to
look
down
upon
them
all
as
children
as
though
he
were
superior
in
development
knowledge
and
convictions
as
though
their
beliefs
and
interests
were
beneath
him
with
razumihin
he
had
got
on
or
at
least
he
was
more
unreserved
and
communicative
with
him
indeed
it
was
impossible
to
be
on
any
other
terms
with
razumihin
he
was
an
exceptionally
good
humoured
and
candid
youth
good
natured
to
the
point
of
simplicity
though
both
depth
and
dignity
lay
concealed
under
that
simplicity
the
better
of
his
comrades
understood
this
and
all
were
fond
of
him
he
was
extremely
intelligent
though
he
was
certainly
rather
a
simpleton
at
times
he
was
of
striking
appearance
tall
thin
blackhaired
and
always
badly
shaved
he
was
sometimes
uproarious
and
was
reputed
to
be
of
great
physical
strength
one
night
when
out
in
a
festive
company
he
had
with
one
blow
laid
a
gigantic
policeman
on
his
back
there
was
no
limit
to
his
drinking
powers
but
he
could
abstain
from
drink
altogether
he
sometimes
went
too
far
in
his
pranks
but
he
could
do
without
pranks
altogether
another
thing
striking
about
razumihin
no
failure
distressed
him
and
it
seemed
as
though
no
unfavourable
circumstances
could
crush
him
he
could
lodge
anywhere
and
bear
the
extremes
of
cold
and
hunger
he
was
very
poor
and
kept
himself
entirely
on
what
he
could
earn
by
work
of
one
sort
or
another
he
knew
of
no
end
of
resources
by
which
to
earn
money
he
spent
one
whole
winter
without
lighting
his
stove
and
used
to
declare
that
he
liked
it
better
because
one
slept
more
soundly
in
the
cold
for
the
present
he
too
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
the
university
but
it
was
only
for
a
time
and
he
was
working
with
all
his
might
to
save
enough
to
return
to
his
studies
again
raskolnikov
had
not
been
to
see
him
for
the
last
four
months
and
razumihin
did
not
even
know
his
address
about
two
months
before
they
had
met
in
the
street
but
raskolnikov
had
turned
away
and
even
crossed
to
the
other
side
that
he
might
not
be
observed
and
though
razumihin
noticed
him
he
passed
him
by
as
he
did
not
want
to
annoy
him
chapter
v
of
course
i
ve
been
meaning
lately
to
go
to
razumihin
s
to
ask
for
work
to
ask
him
to
get
me
lessons
or
something
raskolnikov
thought
but
what
help
can
he
be
to
me
now
suppose
he
gets
me
lessons
suppose
he
shares
his
last
farthing
with
me
if
he
has
any
farthings
so
that
i
could
get
some
boots
and
make
myself
tidy
enough
to
give
lessons
hm
well
and
what
then
what
shall
i
do
with
the
few
coppers
i
earn
that
s
not
what
i
want
now
it
s
really
absurd
for
me
to
go
to
razumihin
the
question
why
he
was
now
going
to
razumihin
agitated
him
even
more
than
he
was
himself
aware
he
kept
uneasily
seeking
for
some
sinister
significance
in
this
apparently
ordinary
action
could
i
have
expected
to
set
it
all
straight
and
to
find
a
way
out
by
means
of
razumihin
alone
he
asked
himself
in
perplexity
he
pondered
and
rubbed
his
forehead
and
strange
to
say
after
long
musing
suddenly
as
if
it
were
spontaneously
and
by
chance
a
fantastic
thought
came
into
his
head
hm
to
razumihin
s
he
said
all
at
once
calmly
as
though
he
had
reached
a
final
determination
i
shall
go
to
razumihin
s
of
course
but
not
now
i
shall
go
to
him
on
the
next
day
after
it
when
it
will
be
over
and
everything
will
begin
afresh
and
suddenly
he
realised
what
he
was
thinking
after
it
he
shouted
jumping
up
from
the
seat
but
is
it
really
going
to
happen
is
it
possible
it
really
will
happen
he
left
the
seat
and
went
off
almost
at
a
run
he
meant
to
turn
back
homewards
but
the
thought
of
going
home
suddenly
filled
him
with
intense
loathing
in
that
hole
in
that
awful
little
cupboard
of
his
all
this
had
for
a
month
past
been
growing
up
in
him
and
he
walked
on
at
random
his
nervous
shudder
had
passed
into
a
fever
that
made
him
feel
shivering
in
spite
of
the
heat
he
felt
cold
with
a
kind
of
effort
he
began
almost
unconsciously
from
some
inner
craving
to
stare
at
all
the
objects
before
him
as
though
looking
for
something
to
distract
his
attention
but
he
did
not
succeed
and
kept
dropping
every
moment
into
brooding
when
with
a
start
he
lifted
his
head
again
and
looked
round
he
forgot
at
once
what
he
had
just
been
thinking
about
and
even
where
he
was
going
in
this
way
he
walked
right
across
vassilyevsky
ostrov
came
out
on
to
the
lesser
neva
crossed
the
bridge
and
turned
towards
the
islands
the
greenness
and
freshness
were
at
first
restful
to
his
weary
eyes
after
the
dust
of
the
town
and
the
huge
houses
that
hemmed
him
in
and
weighed
upon
him
here
there
were
no
taverns
no
stifling
closeness
no
stench
but
soon
these
new
pleasant
sensations
passed
into
morbid
irritability
sometimes
he
stood
still
before
a
brightly
painted
summer
villa
standing
among
green
foliage
he
gazed
through
the
fence
he
saw
in
the
distance
smartly
dressed
women
on
the
verandahs
and
balconies
and
children
running
in
the
gardens
the
flowers
especially
caught
his
attention
he
gazed
at
them
longer
than
at
anything
he
was
met
too
by
luxurious
carriages
and
by
men
and
women
on
horseback
he
watched
them
with
curious
eyes
and
forgot
about
them
before
they
had
vanished
from
his
sight
once
he
stood
still
and
counted
his
money
he
found
he
had
thirty
copecks
twenty
to
the
policeman
three
to
nastasya
for
the
letter
so
i
must
have
given
forty
seven
or
fifty
to
the
marmeladovs
yesterday
he
thought
reckoning
it
up
for
some
unknown
reason
but
he
soon
forgot
with
what
object
he
had
taken
the
money
out
of
his
pocket
he
recalled
it
on
passing
an
eating
house
or
tavern
and
felt
that
he
was
hungry
going
into
the
tavern
he
drank
a
glass
of
vodka
and
ate
a
pie
of
some
sort
he
finished
eating
it
as
he
walked
away
it
was
a
long
while
since
he
had
taken
vodka
and
it
had
an
effect
upon
him
at
once
though
he
only
drank
a
wineglassful
his
legs
felt
suddenly
heavy
and
a
great
drowsiness
came
upon
him
he
turned
homewards
but
reaching
petrovsky
ostrov
he
stopped
completely
exhausted
turned
off
the
road
into
the
bushes
sank
down
upon
the
grass
and
instantly
fell
asleep
in
a
morbid
condition
of
the
brain
dreams
often
have
a
singular
actuality
vividness
and
extraordinary
semblance
of
reality
at
times
monstrous
images
are
created
but
the
setting
and
the
whole
picture
are
so
truth
like
and
filled
with
details
so
delicate
so
unexpectedly
but
so
artistically
consistent
that
the
dreamer
were
he
an
artist
like
pushkin
or
turgenev
even
could
never
have
invented
them
in
the
waking
state
such
sick
dreams
always
remain
long
in
the
memory
and
make
a
powerful
impression
on
the
overwrought
and
deranged
nervous
system
raskolnikov
had
a
fearful
dream
he
dreamt
he
was
back
in
his
childhood
in
the
little
town
of
his
birth
he
was
a
child
about
seven
years
old
walking
into
the
country
with
his
father
on
the
evening
of
a
holiday
it
was
a
grey
and
heavy
day
the
country
was
exactly
as
he
remembered
it
indeed
he
recalled
it
far
more
vividly
in
his
dream
than
he
had
done
in
memory
the
little
town
stood
on
a
level
flat
as
bare
as
the
hand
not
even
a
willow
near
it
only
in
the
far
distance
a
copse
lay
a
dark
blur
on
the
very
edge
of
the
horizon
a
few
paces
beyond
the
last
market
garden
stood
a
tavern
a
big
tavern
which
had
always
aroused
in
him
a
feeling
of
aversion
even
of
fear
when
he
walked
by
it
with
his
father
there
was
always
a
crowd
there
always
shouting
laughter
and
abuse
hideous
hoarse
singing
and
often
fighting
drunken
and
horrible
looking
figures
were
hanging
about
the
tavern
he
used
to
cling
close
to
his
father
trembling
all
over
when
he
met
them
near
the
tavern
the
road
became
a
dusty
track
the
dust
of
which
was
always
black
it
was
a
winding
road
and
about
a
hundred
paces
further
on
it
turned
to
the
right
to
the
graveyard
in
the
middle
of
the
graveyard
stood
a
stone
church
with
a
green
cupola
where
he
used
to
go
to
mass
two
or
three
times
a
year
with
his
father
and
mother
when
a
service
was
held
in
memory
of
his
grandmother
who
had
long
been
dead
and
whom
he
had
never
seen
on
these
occasions
they
used
to
take
on
a
white
dish
tied
up
in
a
table
napkin
a
special
sort
of
rice
pudding
with
raisins
stuck
in
it
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
he
loved
that
church
the
old
fashioned
unadorned
ikons
and
the
old
priest
with
the
shaking
head
near
his
grandmother
s
grave
which
was
marked
by
a
stone
was
the
little
grave
of
his
younger
brother
who
had
died
at
six
months
old
he
did
not
remember
him
at
all
but
he
had
been
told
about
his
little
brother
and
whenever
he
visited
the
graveyard
he
used
religiously
and
reverently
to
cross
himself
and
to
bow
down
and
kiss
the
little
grave
and
now
he
dreamt
that
he
was
walking
with
his
father
past
the
tavern
on
the
way
to
the
graveyard
he
was
holding
his
father
s
hand
and
looking
with
dread
at
the
tavern
a
peculiar
circumstance
attracted
his
attention
there
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
festivity
going
on
there
were
crowds
of
gaily
dressed
townspeople
peasant
women
their
husbands
and
riff
raff
of
all
sorts
all
singing
and
all
more
or
less
drunk
near
the
entrance
of
the
tavern
stood
a
cart
but
a
strange
cart
it
was
one
of
those
big
carts
usually
drawn
by
heavy
cart
horses
and
laden
with
casks
of
wine
or
other
heavy
goods
he
always
liked
looking
at
those
great
cart
horses
with
their
long
manes
thick
legs
and
slow
even
pace
drawing
along
a
perfect
mountain
with
no
appearance
of
effort
as
though
it
were
easier
going
with
a
load
than
without
it
but
now
strange
to
say
in
the
shafts
of
such
a
cart
he
saw
a
thin
little
sorrel
beast
one
of
those
peasants
nags
which
he
had
often
seen
straining
their
utmost
under
a
heavy
load
of
wood
or
hay
especially
when
the
wheels
were
stuck
in
the
mud
or
in
a
rut
and
the
peasants
would
beat
them
so
cruelly
sometimes
even
about
the
nose
and
eyes
and
he
felt
so
sorry
so
sorry
for
them
that
he
almost
cried
and
his
mother
always
used
to
take
him
away
from
the
window
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
great
uproar
of
shouting
singing
and
the
balala
ka
and
from
the
tavern
a
number
of
big
and
very
drunken
peasants
came
out
wearing
red
and
blue
shirts
and
coats
thrown
over
their
shoulders
get
in
get
in
shouted
one
of
them
a
young
thick

clambered
into
mikolka
s
cart
laughing
and
making
jokes
six
men
got
in
and
there
was
still
room
for
more
they
hauled
in
a
fat
rosy
cheeked
woman
she
was
dressed
in
red
cotton
in
a
pointed
beaded
headdress
and
thick
leather
shoes
she
was
cracking
nuts
and
laughing
the
crowd
round
them
was
laughing
too
and
indeed
how
could
they
help
laughing
that
wretched
nag
was
to
drag
all
the
cartload
of
them
at
a
gallop
two
young
fellows
in
the
cart
were
just
getting
whips
ready
to
help
mikolka
with
the
cry
of
now
the
mare
tugged
with
all
her
might
but
far
from
galloping
could
scarcely
move
forward
she
struggled
with
her
legs
gasping
and
shrinking
from
the
blows
of
the
three
whips
which
were
showered
upon
her
like
hail
the
laughter
in
the
cart
and
in
the
crowd
was
redoubled
but
mikolka
flew
into
a
rage
and
furiously
thrashed
the
mare
as
though
he
supposed
she
really
could
gallop

in
too

shouted
a
young
man
in
the
crowd
whose
appetite
was
aroused

in
all

cried
mikolka

and
thrashed
at
the
mare
beside
himself
with
fury

and
he
tried
to

him
away
but
he
tore
himself
away
from
his
hand
and
beside
himself
with
horror
ran
to
the
horse
the
poor
beast
was
in
a
bad
way
she
was
gasping
standing
still
then
tugging
again
and
almost

all
at
once
laughter
broke
into
a
roar
and
covered
everything
the
mare
roused
by
the
shower
of
blows
began
feebly
kicking
even
the
old
man
could
not
help
smiling
to
think
of
a
wretched
little
beast
like
that
trying
to
kick
two
lads
in
the
crowd
snatched
up
whips
and
ran
to
the
mare
to
beat
her
about
the
ribs
one
ran
each
side
hit
her
in
the
face
in
the
eyes
in
the
eyes
cried
mikolka
give

a
song
mates
shouted
someone
in
the
cart
and
everyone
in
the
cart
joined
in
a
riotous
song
jingling
a
tambourine
and
whistling
the
woman
went
on
cracking
nuts
and
laughing
he
ran
beside
the
mare
ran
in
front
of
her
saw
her
being
whipped
across
the
eyes
right
in
the
eyes
he
was
crying
he
felt
choking
his
tears
were
streaming
one
of
the
men
gave
him
a
cut
with
the
whip
across
the
face
he
did
not
feel
it
wringing
his
hands
and
screaming
he
rushed
up
to
the
grey
headed
old
man
with
the
grey
beard
who
was
shaking
his
head
in
disapproval
one
woman
seized
him
by
the
hand
and
would
have
taken
him
away
but
he
tore
himself
from
her
and
ran
back
to
the
mare
she
was
almost
at
the
last
gasp
but
began
kicking
once
more
i
ll
teach
you
to
kick
mikolka
shouted
ferociously
he
threw
down
the
whip
bent
forward
and
picked
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
cart
a
long
thick
shaft
he
took
hold
of
one
end
with
both
hands
and
with
an
effort
brandished
it
over
the
mare
he
ll
crush
her
was
shouted
round
him
he
ll
kill
her
it
s
my
property
shouted
mikolka
and
brought
the
shaft
down
with
a
swinging
blow
there
was
a
sound
of
a
heavy
thud
thrash
her
thrash
her
why
have
you
stopped
shouted
voices
in
the
crowd
and
mikolka
swung
the
shaft
a
second
time
and
it
fell
a
second
time
on
the
spine
of
the
luckless
mare
she
sank
back
on
her
haunches
but
lurched
forward
and
tugged
forward
with
all
her
force
tugged
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
trying
to
move
the
cart
but
the
six
whips
were
attacking
her
in
all
directions
and
the
shaft
was
raised
again
and
fell
upon
her
a
third
time
then
a
fourth
with
heavy
measured
blows
mikolka
was
in
a
fury
that
he
could
not
kill
her
at
one
blow
she
s
a
tough
one
was
shouted
in
the
crowd
she
ll
fall
in
a
minute
mates
there
will
soon
be
an
end
of
her
said
an
admiring
spectator
in
the
crowd
fetch
an
axe
to
her
finish
her
off
shouted
a
third
i
ll
show
you
stand
off
mikolka
screamed
frantically
he
threw
down
the
shaft
stooped
down
in
the
cart
and
picked
up
an
iron
crowbar
look
out
he
shouted
and
with
all
his
might
he
dealt
a
stunning
blow
at
the
poor
mare
the
blow
fell
the
mare
staggered
sank
back
tried
to
pull
but
the
bar
fell
again
with
a
swinging
blow
on
her
back
and
she
fell
on
the
ground
like
a
log
finish
her
off
shouted
mikolka
and
he
leapt
beside
himself
out
of
the
cart
several
young
men
also
flushed
with
drink
seized
anything
they
could
come
across
whips
sticks
poles
and
ran
to
the
dying
mare
mikolka
stood
on
one
side
and
began
dealing
random
blows
with
the
crowbar
the
mare
stretched
out
her
head
drew
a
long
breath
and
died
you
butchered
her
someone
shouted
in
the
crowd
why
wouldn
t
she
gallop
then
my
property
shouted
mikolka
with
bloodshot
eyes
brandishing
the
bar
in
his
hands
he
stood
as
though
regretting
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
beat
no
mistake
about
it
you
are
not
a
christian
many
voices
were
shouting
in
the
crowd
but
the
poor
boy
beside
himself
made
his
way
screaming
through
the
crowd
to
the
sorrel
nag
put
his
arms
round
her
bleeding
dead
head
and
kissed
it
kissed
the
eyes
and
kissed
the
lips
then
he
jumped
up
and
flew
in
a
frenzy
with
his
little
fists
out
at
mikolka
at
that
instant
his
father
who
had
been
running
after
him
snatched
him
up
and
carried
him
out
of
the
crowd
come
along
come
let
us
go
home
he
said
to
him
father
why
did
they
kill
the
poor
horse
he
sobbed
but
his
voice
broke
and
the
words
came
in
shrieks
from
his
panting
chest
they
are
drunk
they
are
brutal
it
s
not
our
business
said
his
father
he
put
his
arms
round
his
father
but
he
felt
choked
choked
he
tried
to
draw
a
breath
to
cry
out
and
woke
up
he
waked
up
gasping
for
breath
his
hair
soaked
with
perspiration
and
stood
up
in
terror
thank
god
that
was
only
a
dream
he
said
sitting
down
under
a
tree
and
drawing
deep
breaths
but
what
is
it
is
it
some
fever
coming
on
such
a
hideous
dream
he
felt
utterly
broken
darkness
and
confusion
were
in
his
soul
he
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
good
god
he
cried
can
it
be
can
it
be
that
i
shall
really
take
an
axe
that
i
shall
strike
her
on
the
head
split
her
skull
open
that
i
shall
tread
in
the
sticky
warm
blood
break
the
lock
steal
and
tremble
hide
all
spattered
in
the
blood
with
the
axe
good
god
can
it
be
he
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
as
he
said
this
but
why
am
i
going
on
like
this
he
continued
sitting
up
again
as
it
were
in
profound
amazement
i
knew
that
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
it
so
what
have
i
been
torturing
myself
for
till
now
yesterday
yesterday
when
i
went
to
make
that
experiment
yesterday
i
realised
completely
that
i
could
never
bear
to
do
it
why
am
i
going
over
it
again
then
why
am
i
hesitating
as
i
came
down
the
stairs
yesterday
i
said
myself
that
it
was
base
loathsome
vile
vile
the
very
thought
of
it
made
me
feel
sick
and
filled
me
with
horror
no
i
couldn
t
do
it
i
couldn
t
do
it
granted
granted
that
there
is
no
flaw
in
all
that
reasoning
that
all
that
i
have
concluded
this
last
month
is
clear
as
day
true
as
arithmetic
my
god
anyway
i
couldn
t
bring
myself
to
it
i
couldn
t
do
it
i
couldn
t
do
it
why
why
then
am
i
still
he
rose
to
his
feet
looked
round
in
wonder
as
though
surprised
at
finding
himself
in
this
place
and
went
towards
the
bridge
he
was
pale
his
eyes
glowed
he
was
exhausted
in
every
limb
but
he
seemed
suddenly
to
breathe
more
easily
he
felt
he
had
cast
off
that
fearful
burden
that
had
so
long
been
weighing
upon
him
and
all
at
once
there
was
a
sense
of
relief
and
peace
in
his
soul
lord
he
prayed
show
me
my
path
i
renounce
that
accursed
dream
of
mine
crossing
the
bridge
he
gazed
quietly
and
calmly
at
the
neva
at
the
glowing
red
sun
setting
in
the
glowing
sky
in
spite
of
his
weakness
he
was
not
conscious
of
fatigue
it
was
as
though
an
abscess
that
had
been
forming
for
a
month
past
in
his
heart
had
suddenly
broken
freedom
freedom
he
was
free
from
that
spell
that
sorcery
that
obsession
later
on
when
he
recalled
that
time
and
all
that
happened
to
him
during
those
days
minute
by
minute
point
by
point
he
was
superstitiously
impressed
by
one
circumstance
which
though
in
itself
not
very
exceptional
always
seemed
to
him
afterwards
the
predestined
turning
point
of
his
fate
he
could
never
understand
and
explain
to
himself
why
when
he
was
tired
and
worn
out
when
it
would
have
been
more
convenient
for
him
to
go
home
by
the
shortest
and
most
direct
way
he
had
returned
by
the
hay
market
where
he
had
no
need
to
go
it
was
obviously
and
quite
unnecessarily
out
of
his
way
though
not
much
so
it
is
true
that
it
happened
to
him
dozens
of
times
to
return
home
without
noticing
what
streets
he
passed
through
but
why
he
was
always
asking
himself
why
had
such
an
important
such
a
decisive
and
at
the
same
time
such
an
absolutely
chance
meeting
happened
in
the
hay
market
where
he
had
moreover
no
reason
to
go
at
the
very
hour
the
very
minute
of
his
life
when
he
was
just
in
the
very
mood
and
in
the
very
circumstances
in
which
that
meeting
was
able
to
exert
the
gravest
and
most
decisive
influence
on
his
whole
destiny
as
though
it
had
been
lying
in
wait
for
him
on
purpose
it
was
about
nine
o
clock
when
he
crossed
the
hay
market
at
the
tables
and
the
barrows
at
the
booths
and
the
shops
all
the
market
people
were
closing
their
establishments
or
clearing
away
and
packing
up
their
wares
and
like
their
customers
were
going
home
rag
pickers
and
costermongers
of
all
kinds
were
crowding
round
the
taverns
in
the
dirty
and
stinking
courtyards
of
the
hay
market
raskolnikov
particularly
liked
this
place
and
the
neighbouring
alleys
when
he
wandered
aimlessly
in
the
streets
here
his
rags
did
not
attract
contemptuous
attention
and
one
could
walk
about
in
any
attire
without
scandalising
people
at
the
corner
of
an
alley
a
huckster
and
his
wife
had
two
tables
set
out
with
tapes
thread
cotton
handkerchiefs
etc
they
too
had
got
up
to
go
home
but
were
lingering
in
conversation
with
a
friend
who
had
just
come
up
to
them
this
friend
was
lizaveta
ivanovna
or
as
everyone
called
her
lizaveta
the
younger
sister
of
the
old
pawnbroker
alyona
ivanovna
whom
raskolnikov
had
visited
the
previous
day
to
pawn
his
watch
and
make
his
experiment
he
already
knew
all
about
lizaveta
and
she
knew
him
a
little
too
she
was
a
single
woman
of
about
thirty
five
tall
clumsy
timid
submissive
and
almost
idiotic
she
was
a
complete
slave
and
went
in
fear
and
trembling
of
her
sister
who
made
her
work
day
and
night
and
even
beat
her
she
was
standing
with
a
bundle
before
the
huckster
and
his
wife
listening
earnestly
and
doubtfully
they
were
talking
of
something
with
special
warmth
the
moment
raskolnikov
caught
sight
of
her
he
was
overcome
by
a
strange
sensation
as
it
were
of
intense
astonishment
though
there
was
nothing
astonishing
about
this
meeting
you
could
make
up
your
mind
for
yourself
lizaveta
ivanovna
the
huckster
was
saying
aloud
come
round
to
morrow
about
seven
they
will
be
here
too
to
morrow
said
lizaveta
slowly
and
thoughtfully
as
though
unable
to
make
up
her
mind
upon
my
word
what
a
fright
you
are
in
of
alyona
ivanovna
gabbled
the
huckster
s
wife
a
lively
little
woman
i
look
at
you
you
are
like
some
little
babe
and
she
is
not
your
own
sister
either
nothing
but
a
step
sister
and
what
a
hand
she
keeps
over
you
but
this
time
don
t
say
a
word
to
alyona
ivanovna
her
husband
interrupted
that
s
my
advice
but
come
round
to
us
without
asking
it
will
be
worth
your
while
later
on
your
sister
herself
may
have
a
notion
am
i
to
come
about
seven
o
clock
to
morrow
and
they
will
be
here
you
will
be
able
to
decide
for
yourself
and
we
ll
have
a
cup
of
tea
added
his
wife
all
right
i
ll
come
said
lizaveta
still
pondering
and
she
began
slowly
moving
away
raskolnikov
had
just
passed
and
heard
no
more
he
passed
softly
unnoticed
trying
not
to
miss
a
word
his
first
amazement
was
followed
by
a
thrill
of
horror
like
a
shiver
running
down
his
spine
he
had
learnt
he
had
suddenly
quite
unexpectedly
learnt
that
the
next
day
at
seven
o
clock
lizaveta
the
old
woman
s
sister
and
only
companion
would
be
away
from
home
and
that
therefore
at
seven
o
clock
precisely
the
old
woman
would
be
left
alone
he
was
only
a
few
steps
from
his
lodging
he
went
in
like
a
man
condemned
to
death
he
thought
of
nothing
and
was
incapable
of
thinking
but
he
felt
suddenly
in
his
whole
being
that
he
had
no
more
freedom
of
thought
no
will
and
that
everything
was
suddenly
and
irrevocably
decided
certainly
if
he
had
to
wait
whole
years
for
a
suitable
opportunity
he
could
not
reckon
on
a
more
certain
step
towards
the
success
of
the
plan
than
that
which
had
just
presented
itself
in
any
case
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
out
beforehand
and
with
certainty
with
greater
exactness
and
less
risk
and
without
dangerous
inquiries
and
investigations
that
next
day
at
a
certain
time
an
old
woman
on
whose
life
an
attempt
was
contemplated
would
be
at
home
and
entirely
alone
chapter
vi
later
on
raskolnikov
happened
to
find
out
why
the
huckster
and
his
wife
had
invited
lizaveta
it
was
a
very
ordinary
matter
and
there
was
nothing
exceptional
about
it
a
family
who
had
come
to
the
town
and
been
reduced
to
poverty
were
selling
their
household
goods
and
clothes
all
women
s
things
as
the
things
would
have
fetched
little
in
the
market
they
were
looking
for
a
dealer
this
was
lizaveta
s
business
she
undertook
such
jobs
and
was
frequently
employed
as
she
was
very
honest
and
always
fixed
a
fair
price
and
stuck
to
it
she
spoke
as
a
rule
little
and
as
we
have
said
already
she
was
very
submissive
and
timid
but
raskolnikov
had
become
superstitious
of
late
the
traces
of
superstition
remained
in
him
long
after
and
were
almost
ineradicable
and
in
all
this
he
was
always
afterwards
disposed
to
see
something
strange
and
mysterious
as
it
were
the
presence
of
some
peculiar
influences
and
coincidences
in
the
previous
winter
a
student
he
knew
called
pokorev
who
had
left
for
harkov
had
chanced
in
conversation
to
give
him
the
address
of
alyona
ivanovna
the
old
pawnbroker
in
case
he
might
want
to
pawn
anything
for
a
long
while
he
did
not
go
to
her
for
he
had
lessons
and
managed
to
get
along
somehow
six
weeks
ago
he
had
remembered
the
address
he
had
two
articles
that
could
be
pawned
his
father
s
old
silver
watch
and
a
little
gold
ring
with
three
red
stones
a
present
from
his
sister
at
parting
he
decided
to
take
the
ring
when
he
found
the
old
woman
he
had
felt
an
insurmountable
repulsion
for
her
at
the
first
glance
though
he
knew
nothing
special
about
her
he
got
two
roubles
from
her
and
went
into
a
miserable
little
tavern
on
his
way
home
he
asked
for
tea
sat
down
and
sank
into
deep
thought
a
strange
idea
was
pecking
at
his
brain
like
a
chicken
in
the
egg
and
very
very
much
absorbed
him
almost
beside
him
at
the
next
table
there
was
sitting
a
student
whom
he
did
not
know
and
had
never
seen
and
with
him
a
young
officer
they
had
played
a
game
of
billiards
and
began
drinking
tea
all
at
once
he
heard
the
student
mention
to
the
officer
the
pawnbroker
alyona
ivanovna
and
give
him
her
address
this
of
itself
seemed
strange
to
raskolnikov
he
had
just
come
from
her
and
here
at
once
he
heard
her
name
of
course
it
was
a
chance
but
he
could
not
shake
off
a
very
extraordinary
impression
and
here
someone
seemed
to
be
speaking
expressly
for
him
the
student
began
telling
his
friend
various
details
about
alyona
ivanovna
she
is
first
rate
he
said
you
can
always
get
money
from
her
she
is
as
rich
as
a
jew
she
can
give
you
five
thousand
roubles
at
a
time
and
she
is
not
above
taking
a
pledge
for
a
rouble
lots
of
our
fellows
have
had
dealings
with
her
but
she
is
an
awful
old
harpy
and
he
began
describing
how
spiteful
and
uncertain
she
was
how
if
you
were
only
a
day
late
with
your
interest
the
pledge
was
lost
how
she
gave
a
quarter
of
the
value
of
an
article
and
took
five
and
even
seven
percent
a
month
on
it
and
so
on
the
student
chattered
on
saying
that
she
had
a
sister
lizaveta
whom
the
wretched
little
creature
was
continually
beating
and
kept
in
complete
bondage
like
a
small
child
though
lizaveta
was
at
least
six
feet
high
there
s
a
phenomenon
for
you
cried
the
student
and
he
laughed
they
began
talking
about
lizaveta
the
student
spoke
about
her
with
a
peculiar
relish
and
was
continually
laughing
and
the
officer
listened
with
great
interest
and
asked
him
to
send
lizaveta
to
do
some
mending
for
him
raskolnikov
did
not
miss
a
word
and
learned
everything
about
her
lizaveta
was
younger
than
the
old
woman
and
was
her
half
sister
being
the
child
of
a
different
mother
she
was
thirty
five
she
worked
day
and
night
for
her
sister
and
besides
doing
the
cooking
and
the
washing
she
did
sewing
and
worked
as
a
charwoman
and
gave
her
sister
all
she
earned
she
did
not
dare
to
accept
an
order
or
job
of
any
kind
without
her
sister
s
permission
the
old
woman
had
already
made
her
will
and
lizaveta
knew
of
it
and
by
this
will
she
would
not
get
a
farthing
nothing
but
the
movables
chairs
and
so
on
all
the
money
was
left
to
a
monastery
in
the
province
of
n
that
prayers
might
be
said
for
her
in
perpetuity
lizaveta
was
of
lower
rank
than
her
sister
unmarried
and
awfully
uncouth
in
appearance
remarkably
tall
with
long
feet
that
looked
as
if
they
were
bent
outwards
she
always
wore
battered
goatskin
shoes
and
was
clean
in
her
person
what
the
student
expressed
most
surprise
and
amusement
about
was
the
fact
that
lizaveta
was
continually
with
child
but
you
say
she
is
hideous
observed
the
officer
yes
she
is
so
dark
skinned
and
looks
like
a
soldier
dressed
up
but
you
know
she
is
not
at
all
hideous
she
has
such
a
good
natured
face
and
eyes
strikingly
so
and
the
proof
of
it
is
that
lots
of
people
are
attracted
by
her
she
is
such
a
soft
gentle
creature
ready
to
put
up
with
anything
always
willing
willing
to
do
anything
and
her
smile
is
really
very
sweet
you
seem
to
find
her
attractive
yourself
laughed
the
officer
from
her
queerness
no
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
could
kill
that
damned
old
woman
and
make
off
with
her
money
i
assure
you
without
the
faintest
conscience
prick
the
student
added
with
warmth
the
officer
laughed
again
while
raskolnikov
shuddered
how
strange
it
was
listen
i
want
to
ask
you
a
serious
question
the
student
said
hotly
i
was
joking
of
course
but
look
here
on
one
side
we
have
a
stupid
senseless
worthless
spiteful
ailing
horrid
old
woman
not
simply
useless
but
doing
actual
mischief
who
has
not
an
idea
what
she
is
living
for
herself
and
who
will
die
in
a
day
or
two
in
any
case
you
understand
you
understand
yes
yes
i
understand
answered
the
officer
watching
his
excited
companion
attentively
well
listen
then
on
the
other
side
fresh
young
lives
thrown
away
for
want
of
help
and
by
thousands
on
every
side
a
hundred
thousand
good
deeds
could
be
done
and
helped
on
that
old
woman
s
money
which
will
be
buried
in
a
monastery
hundreds
thousands
perhaps
might
be
set
on
the
right
path
dozens
of
families
saved
from
destitution
from
ruin
from
vice
from
the
lock
hospitals
and
all
with
her
money
kill
her
take
her
money
and
with
the
help
of
it
devote
oneself
to
the
service
of
humanity
and
the
good
of
all
what
do
you
think
would
not
one
tiny
crime
be
wiped
out
by
thousands
of
good
deeds
for
one
life
thousands
would
be
saved
from
corruption
and
decay
one
death
and
a
hundred
lives
in
exchange
it
s
simple
arithmetic
besides
what
value
has
the
life
of
that
sickly
stupid
ill
natured
old
woman
in
the
balance
of
existence
no
more
than
the
life
of
a
louse
of
a
black
beetle
less
in
fact
because
the
old
woman
is
doing
harm
she
is
wearing
out
the
lives
of
others
the
other
day
she
bit
lizaveta
s
finger
out
of
spite
it
almost
had
to
be
amputated
of
course
she
does
not
deserve
to
live
remarked
the
officer
but
there
it
is
it
s
nature
oh
well
brother
but
we
have
to
correct
and
direct
nature
and
but
for
that
we
should
drown
in
an
ocean
of
prejudice
but
for
that
there
would
never
have
been
a
single
great
man
they
talk
of
duty
conscience
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
against
duty
and
conscience
but
the
point
is
what
do
we
mean
by
them
stay
i
have
another
question
to
ask
you
listen
no
you
stay
i
ll
ask
you
a
question
listen
well
you
are
talking
and
speechifying
away
but
tell
me
would
you
kill
the
old
woman
yourself
of
course
not
i
was
only
arguing
the
justice
of
it
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
i
think
if
you
would
not
do
it
yourself
there
s
no
justice
about
it
let
us
have
another
game
raskolnikov
was
violently
agitated
of
course
it
was
all
ordinary
youthful
talk
and
thought
such
as
he
had
often
heard
before
in
different
forms
and
on
different
themes
but
why
had
he
happened
to
hear
such
a
discussion
and
such
ideas
at
the
very
moment
when
his
own
brain
was
just
conceiving
the
very
same
ideas
and
why
just
at
the
moment
when
he
had
brought
away
the
embryo
of
his
idea
from
the
old
woman
had
he
dropped
at
once
upon
a
conversation
about
her
this
coincidence
always
seemed
strange
to
him
this
trivial
talk
in
a
tavern
had
an
immense
influence
on
him
in
his
later
action
as
though
there
had
really
been
in
it
something
preordained
some
guiding
hint

on
returning
from
the
hay
market
he
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
and
sat
for
a
whole
hour
without
stirring
meanwhile
it
got
dark
he
had
no
candle
and
indeed
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
light
up
he
could
never
recollect
whether
he
had
been
thinking
about
anything
at
that
time
at
last
he
was
conscious
of
his
former
fever
and
shivering
and
he
realised
with
relief
that
he
could
lie
down
on
the
sofa
soon
heavy
leaden
sleep
came
over
him
as
it
were
crushing
him
he
slept
an
extraordinarily
long
time
and
without
dreaming
nastasya
coming
into
his
room
at
ten
o
clock
the
next
morning
had
difficulty
in
rousing
him
she
brought
him
in
tea
and
bread
the
tea
was
again
the
second
brew
and
again
in
her
own
tea
pot
my
goodness
how
he
sleeps
she
cried
indignantly
and
he
is
always
asleep
he
got
up
with
an
effort
his
head
ached
he
stood
up
took
a
turn
in
his
garret
and
sank
back
on
the
sofa
again
going
to
sleep
again
cried
nastasya
are
you
ill
eh
he
made
no
reply
do
you
want
some
tea
afterwards
he
said
with
an
effort
closing
his
eyes
again
and
turning
to
the
wall
nastasya
stood
over
him
perhaps
he
really
is
ill
she
said
turned
and
went
out
she
came
in
again
at
two
o
clock
with
soup
he
was
lying
as
before
the
tea
stood
untouched
nastasya
felt
positively
offended
and
began
wrathfully
rousing
him
why
are
you
lying
like
a
log
she
shouted
looking
at
him
with
repulsion
he
got
up
and
sat
down
again
but
said
nothing
and
stared
at
the
floor
are
you
ill
or
not
asked
nastasya
and
again
received
no
answer
you
d
better
go
out
and
get
a
breath
of
air
she
said
after
a
pause
will
you
eat
it
or
not
afterwards
he
said
weakly
you
can
go
and
he
motioned
her
out
she
remained
a
little
longer
looked
at
him
with
compassion
and
went
out
a
few
minutes
afterwards
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
for
a
long
while
at
the
tea
and
the
soup
then
he
took
the
bread
took
up
a
spoon
and
began
to
eat
he
ate
a
little
three
or
four
spoonfuls
without
appetite
as
it
were
mechanically
his
head
ached
less
after
his
meal
he
stretched
himself
on
the
sofa
again
but
now
he
could
not
sleep
he
lay
without
stirring
with
his
face
in
the
pillow
he
was
haunted
by
day
dreams
and
such
strange
day
dreams
in
one
that
kept
recurring
he
fancied
that
he
was
in
africa
in
egypt
in
some
sort
of
oasis
the
caravan
was
resting
the
camels
were
peacefully
lying
down
the
palms
stood
all
around
in
a
complete
circle
all
the
party
were
at
dinner
but
he
was
drinking
water
from
a
spring
which
flowed
gurgling
close
by
and
it
was
so
cool
it
was
wonderful
wonderful
blue
cold
water
running
among
the
parti
coloured
stones
and
over
the
clean
sand
which
glistened
here
and
there
like
gold
suddenly
he
heard
a
clock
strike
he
started
roused
himself
raised
his
head
looked
out
of
the
window
and
seeing
how
late
it
was
suddenly
jumped
up
wide
awake
as
though
someone
had
pulled
him
off
the
sofa
he
crept
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
stealthily
opened
it
and
began
listening
on
the
staircase
his
heart
beat
terribly
but
all
was
quiet
on
the
stairs
as
if
everyone
was
asleep
it
seemed
to
him
strange
and
monstrous
that
he
could
have
slept
in
such
forgetfulness
from
the
previous
day
and
had
done
nothing
had
prepared
nothing
yet
and
meanwhile
perhaps
it
had
struck
six
and
his
drowsiness
and
stupefaction
were
followed
by
an
extraordinary
feverish
as
it
were
distracted
haste
but
the
preparations
to
be
made
were
few
he
concentrated
all
his
energies
on
thinking
of
everything
and
forgetting
nothing
and
his
heart
kept
beating
and
thumping
so
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
first
he
had
to
make
a
noose
and
sew
it
into
his
overcoat
a
work
of
a
moment
he
rummaged
under
his
pillow
and
picked
out
amongst
the
linen
stuffed
away
under
it
a
worn
out
old
unwashed
shirt
from
its
rags
he
tore
a
long
strip
a
couple
of
inches
wide
and
about
sixteen
inches
long
he
folded
this
strip
in
two
took
off
his
wide
strong
summer
overcoat
of
some
stout
cotton
material
his
only
outer
garment
and
began
sewing
the
two
ends
of
the
rag
on
the
inside
under
the
left
armhole
his
hands
shook
as
he
sewed
but
he
did
it
successfully
so
that
nothing
showed
outside
when
he
put
the
coat
on
again
the
needle
and
thread
he
had
got
ready
long
before
and
they
lay
on
his
table
in
a
piece
of
paper
as
for
the
noose
it
was
a
very
ingenious
device
of
his
own
the
noose
was
intended
for
the
axe
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
carry
the
axe
through
the
street
in
his
hands
and
if
hidden
under
his
coat
he
would
still
have
had
to
support
it
with
his
hand
which
would
have
been
noticeable
now
he
had
only
to
put
the
head
of
the
axe
in
the
noose
and
it
would
hang
quietly
under
his
arm
on
the
inside
putting
his
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
he
could
hold
the
end
of
the
handle
all
the
way
so
that
it
did
not
swing
and
as
the
coat
was
very
full
a
regular
sack
in
fact
it
could
not
be
seen
from
outside
that
he
was
holding
something
with
the
hand
that
was
in
the
pocket
this
noose
too
he
had
designed
a
fortnight
before
when
he
had
finished
with
this
he
thrust
his
hand
into
a
little
opening
between
his
sofa
and
the
floor
fumbled
in
the
left
corner
and
drew
out
the
pledge
which
he
had
got
ready
long
before
and
hidden
there
this
pledge
was
however
only
a
smoothly
planed
piece
of
wood
the
size
and
thickness
of
a
silver
cigarette
case
he
picked
up
this
piece
of
wood
in
one
of
his
wanderings
in
a
courtyard
where
there
was
some
sort
of
a
workshop
afterwards
he
had
added
to
the
wood
a
thin
smooth
piece
of
iron
which
he
had
also
picked
up
at
the
same
time
in
the
street
putting
the
iron
which
was
a
little
the
smaller
on
the
piece
of
wood
he
fastened
them
very
firmly
crossing
and
re
crossing
the
thread
round
them
then
wrapped
them
carefully
and
daintily
in
clean
white
paper
and
tied
up
the
parcel
so
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
untie
it
this
was
in
order
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
old
woman
for
a
time
while
she
was
trying
to
undo
the
knot
and
so
to
gain
a
moment
the
iron
strip
was
added
to
give
weight
so
that
the
woman
might
not
guess
the
first
minute
that
the
thing
was
made
of
wood
all
this
had
been
stored
by
him
beforehand
under
the
sofa
he
had
only
just
got
the
pledge
out
when
he
heard
someone
suddenly
about
in
the
yard
it
struck
six
long
ago
long
ago
my
god
he
rushed
to
the
door
listened
caught
up
his
hat
and
began
to
descend
his
thirteen
steps
cautiously
noiselessly
like
a
cat
he
had
still
the
most
important
thing
to
do
to
steal
the
axe
from
the
kitchen
that
the
deed
must
be
done
with
an
axe
he
had
decided
long
ago
he
had
also
a
pocket
pruning
knife
but
he
could
not
rely
on
the
knife
and
still
less
on
his
own
strength
and
so
resolved
finally
on
the
axe
we
may
note
in
passing
one
peculiarity
in
regard
to
all
the
final
resolutions
taken
by
him
in
the
matter
they
had
one
strange
characteristic
the
more
final
they
were
the
more
hideous
and
the
more
absurd
they
at
once
became
in
his
eyes
in
spite
of
all
his
agonising
inward
struggle
he
never
for
a
single
instant
all
that
time
could
believe
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
plans
and
indeed
if
it
had
ever
happened
that
everything
to
the
least
point
could
have
been
considered
and
finally
settled
and
no
uncertainty
of
any
kind
had
remained
he
would
it
seems
have
renounced
it
all
as
something
absurd
monstrous
and
impossible
but
a
whole
mass
of
unsettled
points
and
uncertainties
remained
as
for
getting
the
axe
that
trifling
business
cost
him
no
anxiety
for
nothing
could
be
easier
nastasya
was
continually
out
of
the
house
especially
in
the
evenings
she
would
run
in
to
the
neighbours
or
to
a
shop
and
always
left
the
door
ajar
it
was
the
one
thing
the
landlady
was
always
scolding
her
about
and
so
when
the
time
came
he
would
only
have
to
go
quietly
into
the
kitchen
and
to
take
the
axe
and
an
hour
later
when
everything
was
over
go
in
and
put
it
back
again
but
these
were
doubtful
points
supposing
he
returned
an
hour
later
to
put
it
back
and
nastasya
had
come
back
and
was
on
the
spot
he
would
of
course
have
to
go
by
and
wait
till
she
went
out
again
but
supposing
she
were
in
the
meantime
to
miss
the
axe
look
for
it
make
an
outcry
that
would
mean
suspicion
or
at
least
grounds
for
suspicion
but
those
were
all
trifles
which
he
had
not
even
begun
to
consider
and
indeed
he
had
no
time
he
was
thinking
of
the
chief
point
and
put
off
trifling
details
until
he
could
believe
in
it
all
but
that
seemed
utterly
unattainable
so
it
seemed
to
himself
at
least
he
could
not
imagine
for
instance
that
he
would
sometime
leave
off
thinking
get
up
and
simply
go
there
even
his
late
experiment
i
e
his
visit
with
the
object
of
a
final
survey
of
the
place
was
simply
an
attempt
at
an
experiment
far
from
being
the
real
thing
as
though
one
should
say
come
let
us
go
and
try
it
why
dream
about
it
and
at
once
he
had
broken
down
and
had
run
away
cursing
in
a
frenzy
with
himself
meanwhile
it
would
seem
as
regards
the
moral
question
that
his
analysis
was
complete
his
casuistry
had
become
keen
as
a
razor
and
he
could
not
find
rational
objections
in
himself
but
in
the
last
resort
he
simply
ceased
to
believe
in
himself
and
doggedly
slavishly
sought
arguments
in
all
directions
fumbling
for
them
as
though
someone
were
forcing
and
drawing
him
to
it
at
first
long
before
indeed
he
had
been
much
occupied
with
one
question
why
almost
all
crimes
are
so
badly
concealed
and
so
easily
detected
and
why
almost
all
criminals
leave
such
obvious
traces
he
had
come
gradually
to
many
different
and
curious
conclusions
and
in
his
opinion
the
chief
reason
lay
not
so
much
in
the
material
impossibility
of
concealing
the
crime
as
in
the
criminal
himself
almost
every
criminal
is
subject
to
a
failure
of
will
and
reasoning
power
by
a
childish
and
phenomenal
heedlessness
at
the
very
instant
when
prudence
and
caution
are
most
essential
it
was
his
conviction
that
this
eclipse
of
reason
and
failure
of
will
power
attacked
a
man
like
a
disease
developed
gradually
and
reached
its
highest
point
just
before
the
perpetration
of
the
crime
continued
with
equal
violence
at
the
moment
of
the
crime
and
for
longer
or
shorter
time
after
according
to
the
individual
case
and
then
passed
off
like
any
other
disease
the
question
whether
the
disease
gives
rise
to
the
crime
or
whether
the
crime
from
its
own
peculiar
nature
is
always
accompanied
by
something
of
the
nature
of
disease
he
did
not
yet
feel
able
to
decide
when
he
reached
these
conclusions
he
decided
that
in
his
own
case
there
could
not
be
such
a
morbid
reaction
that
his
reason
and
will
would
remain
unimpaired
at
the
time
of
carrying
out
his
design
for
the
simple
reason
that
his
design
was
not
a
crime
we
will
omit
all
the
process
by
means
of
which
he
arrived
at
this
last
conclusion
we
have
run
too
far
ahead
already
we
may
add
only
that
the
practical
purely
material
difficulties
of
the
affair
occupied
a
secondary
position
in
his
mind
one
has
but
to
keep
all
one
s
will
power
and
reason
to
deal
with
them
and
they
will
all
be
overcome
at
the
time
when
once
one
has
familiarised
oneself
with
the
minutest
details
of
the
business
but
this
preparation
had
never
been
begun
his
final
decisions
were
what
he
came
to
trust
least
and
when
the
hour
struck
it
all
came
to
pass
quite
differently
as
it
were
accidentally
and
unexpectedly
one
trifling
circumstance
upset
his
calculations
before
he
had
even
left
the
staircase
when
he
reached
the
landlady
s
kitchen
the
door
of
which
was
open
as
usual
he
glanced
cautiously
in
to
see
whether
in
nastasya
s
absence
the
landlady
herself
was
there
or
if
not
whether
the
door
to
her
own
room
was
closed
so
that
she
might
not
peep
out
when
he
went
in
for
the
axe
but
what
was
his
amazement
when
he
suddenly
saw
that
nastasya
was
not
only
at
home
in
the
kitchen
but
was
occupied
there
taking
linen
out
of
a
basket
and
hanging
it
on
a
line
seeing
him
she
left
off
hanging
the
clothes
turned
to
him
and
stared
at
him
all
the
time
he
was
passing
he
turned
away
his
eyes
and
walked
past
as
though
he
noticed
nothing
but
it
was
the
end
of
everything
he
had
not
the
axe
he
was
overwhelmed
what
made
me
think
he
reflected
as
he
went
under
the
gateway
what
made
me
think
that
she
would
be
sure
not
to
be
at
home
at
that
moment
why
why
why
did
i
assume
this
so
certainly
he
was
crushed
and
even
humiliated
he
could
have
laughed
at
himself
in
his
anger
a
dull
animal
rage
boiled
within
him
he
stood
hesitating
in
the
gateway
to
go
into
the
street
to
go
a
walk
for
appearance
sake
was
revolting
to
go
back
to
his
room
even
more
revolting
and
what
a
chance
i
have
lost
for
ever
he
muttered
standing
aimlessly
in
the
gateway
just
opposite
the
porter
s
little
dark
room
which
was
also
open
suddenly
he
started
from
the
porter
s
room
two
paces
away
from
him
something
shining
under
the
bench
to
the
right
caught
his
eye
he
looked
about
him
nobody
he
approached
the
room
on
tiptoe
went
down
two
steps
into
it
and
in
a
faint
voice
called
the
porter
yes
not
at
home
somewhere
near
though
in
the
yard
for
the
door
is
wide
open
he
dashed
to
the
axe
it
was
an
axe
and
pulled
it
out
from
under
the
bench
where
it
lay
between
two
chunks
of
wood
at
once
before
going
out
he
made
it
fast
in
the
noose
he
thrust
both
hands
into
his
pockets
and
went
out
of
the
room
no
one
had
noticed
him
when
reason
fails
the
devil
helps
he
thought
with
a
strange
grin
this
chance
raised
his
spirits
extraordinarily
he
walked
along
quietly
and
sedately
without
hurry
to
avoid
awakening
suspicion
he
scarcely
looked
at
the
passers
by
tried
to
escape
looking
at
their
faces
at
all
and
to
be
as
little
noticeable
as
possible
suddenly
he
thought
of
his
hat
good
heavens
i
had
the
money
the
day
before
yesterday
and
did
not
get
a
cap
to
wear
instead
a
curse
rose
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
glancing
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
into
a
shop
he
saw
by
a
clock
on
the
wall
that
it
was
ten
minutes
past
seven
he
had
to
make
haste
and
at
the
same
time
to
go
someway
round
so
as
to
approach
the
house
from
the
other
side
when
he
had
happened
to
imagine
all
this
beforehand
he
had
sometimes
thought
that
he
would
be
very
much
afraid
but
he
was
not
very
much
afraid
now
was
not
afraid
at
all
indeed
his
mind
was
even
occupied
by
irrelevant
matters
but
by
nothing
for
long
as
he
passed
the
yusupov
garden
he
was
deeply
absorbed
in
considering
the
building
of
great
fountains
and
of
their
refreshing
effect
on
the
atmosphere
in
all
the
squares
by
degrees
he
passed
to
the
conviction
that
if
the
summer
garden
were
extended
to
the
field
of
mars
and
perhaps
joined
to
the
garden
of
the
mihailovsky
palace
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
and
a
great
benefit
to
the
town
then
he
was
interested
by
the
question
why
in
all
great
towns
men
are
not
simply
driven
by
necessity
but
in
some
peculiar
way
inclined
to
live
in
those
parts
of
the
town
where
there
are
no
gardens
nor
fountains
where
there
is
most
dirt
and
smell
and
all
sorts
of
nastiness
then
his
own
walks
through
the
hay
market
came
back
to
his
mind
and
for
a
moment
he
waked
up
to
reality
what
nonsense
he
thought
better
think
of
nothing
at
all
so
probably
men
led
to
execution
clutch
mentally
at
every
object
that
meets
them
on
the
way
flashed
through
his
mind
but
simply
flashed
like
lightning
he
made
haste
to
dismiss
this
thought
and
by
now
he
was
near
here
was
the
house
here
was
the
gate
suddenly
a
clock
somewhere
struck
once
what
can
it
be
half
past
seven
impossible
it
must
be
fast
luckily
for
him
everything
went
well
again
at
the
gates
at
that
very
moment
as
though
expressly
for
his
benefit
a
huge
waggon
of
hay
had
just
driven
in
at
the
gate
completely
screening
him
as
he
passed
under
the
gateway
and
the
waggon
had
scarcely
had
time
to
drive
through
into
the
yard
before
he
had
slipped
in
a
flash
to
the
right
on
the
other
side
of
the
waggon
he
could
hear
shouting
and
quarrelling
but
no
one
noticed
him
and
no
one
met
him
many
windows
looking
into
that
huge
quadrangular
yard
were
open
at
that
moment
but
he
did
not
raise
his
head
he
had
not
the
strength
to
the
staircase
leading
to
the
old
woman
s
room
was
close
by
just
on
the
right
of
the
gateway
he
was
already
on
the
stairs
drawing
a
breath
pressing
his
hand
against
his
throbbing
heart
and
once
more
feeling
for
the
axe
and
setting
it
straight
he
began
softly
and
cautiously
ascending
the
stairs
listening
every
minute
but
the
stairs
too
were
quite
deserted
all
the
doors
were
shut
he
met
no
one
one
flat
indeed
on
the
first
floor
was
wide
open
and
painters
were
at
work
in
it
but
they
did
not
glance
at
him
he
stood
still
thought
a
minute
and
went
on
of
course
it
would
be
better
if
they
had
not
been
here
but
it
s
two
storeys
above
them
and
there
was
the
fourth
storey
here
was
the
door
here
was
the
flat
opposite
the
empty
one
the
flat
underneath
the
old
woman
s
was
apparently
empty
also
the
visiting
card
nailed
on
the
door
had
been
torn
off
they
had
gone
away
he
was
out
of
breath
for
one
instant
the
thought
floated
through
his
mind
shall
i
go
back
but
he
made
no
answer
and
began
listening
at
the
old
woman
s
door
a
dead
silence
then
he
listened
again
on
the
staircase
listened
long
and
intently
then
looked
about
him
for
the
last
time
pulled
himself
together
drew
himself
up
and
once
more
tried
the
axe
in
the
noose
am
i
very
pale
he
wondered
am
i
not
evidently
agitated
she
is
mistrustful
had
i
better
wait
a
little
longer
till
my
heart
leaves
off
thumping
but
his
heart
did
not
leave
off
on
the
contrary
as
though
to
spite
him
it
throbbed
more
and
more
violently
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
slowly
put
out
his
hand
to
the
bell
and
rang
half
a
minute
later
he
rang
again
more
loudly
no
answer
to
go
on
ringing
was
useless
and
out
of
place
the
old
woman
was
of
course
at
home
but
she
was
suspicious
and
alone
he
had
some
knowledge
of
her
habits
and
once
more
he
put
his
ear
to
the
door
either
his
senses
were
peculiarly
keen
which
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
or
the
sound
was
really
very
distinct
anyway
he
suddenly
heard
something
like
the
cautious
touch
of
a
hand
on
the
lock
and
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
at
the
very
door
someone
was
standing
stealthily
close
to
the
lock
and
just
as
he
was
doing
on
the
outside
was
secretly
listening
within
and
seemed
to
have
her
ear
to
the
door
he
moved
a
little
on
purpose
and
muttered
something
aloud
that
he
might
not
have
the
appearance
of
hiding
then
rang
a
third
time
but
quietly
soberly
and
without
impatience
recalling
it
afterwards
that
moment
stood
out
in
his
mind
vividly
distinctly
for
ever
he
could
not
make
out
how
he
had
had
such
cunning
for
his
mind
was
as
it
were
clouded
at
moments
and
he
was
almost
unconscious
of
his
body
an
instant
later
he
heard
the
latch
unfastened
chapter
vii
the
door
was
as
before
opened
a
tiny
crack
and
again
two
sharp
and
suspicious
eyes
stared
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
then
raskolnikov
lost
his
head
and
nearly
made
a
great
mistake
fearing
the
old
woman
would
be
frightened
by
their
being
alone
and
not
hoping
that
the
sight
of
him
would
disarm
her
suspicions
he
took
hold
of
the
door
and
drew
it
towards
him
to
prevent
the
old
woman
from
attempting
to
shut
it
again
seeing
this
she
did
not
pull
the
door
back
but
she
did
not
let
go
the
handle
so
that
he
almost
dragged
her
out
with
it
on
to
the
stairs
seeing
that
she
was
standing
in
the
doorway
not
allowing
him
to
pass
he
advanced
straight
upon
her
she
stepped
back
in
alarm
tried
to
say
something
but
seemed
unable
to
speak
and
stared
with
open
eyes
at
him
good
evening
alyona
ivanovna
he
began
trying
to
speak
easily
but
his
voice
would
not
obey
him
it
broke
and
shook
i
have
come
i
have
brought
something
but
we
d
better
come
in
to
the
light
and
leaving
her
he
passed
straight
into
the
room
uninvited
the
old
woman
ran
after
him
her
tongue
was
unloosed
good
heavens
what
it
is
who
is
it
what
do
you
want
why
alyona
ivanovna
you
know
me
raskolnikov
here
i
brought
you
the
pledge
i
promised
the
other
day
and
he
held
out
the
pledge
the
old
woman
glanced
for
a
moment
at
the
pledge
but
at
once
stared
in
the
eyes
of
her
uninvited
visitor
she
looked
intently
maliciously
and
mistrustfully
a
minute
passed
he
even
fancied
something
like
a
sneer
in
her
eyes
as
though
she
had
already
guessed
everything
he
felt
that
he
was
losing
his
head
that
he
was
almost
frightened
so
frightened
that
if
she
were
to
look
like
that
and
not
say
a
word
for
another
half
minute
he
thought
he
would
have
run
away
from
her
why
do
you
look
at
me
as
though
you
did
not
know
me
he
said
suddenly
also
with
malice
take
it
if
you
like
if
not
i
ll
go
elsewhere
i
am
in
a
hurry
he
had
not
even
thought
of
saying
this
but
it
was
suddenly
said
of
itself
the
old
woman
recovered
herself
and
her
visitor
s
resolute
tone
evidently
restored
her
confidence
but
why
my
good
sir
all
of
a
minute
what
is
it
she
asked
looking
at
the
pledge
the
silver
cigarette
case
i
spoke
of
it
last
time
you
know
she
held
out
her
hand
but
how
pale
you
are
to
be
sure
and
your
hands
are
trembling
too
have
you
been
bathing
or
what
fever
he
answered
abruptly
you
can
t
help
getting
pale
if
you
ve
nothing
to
eat
he
added
with
difficulty
articulating
the
words
his
strength
was
failing
him
again
but
his
answer
sounded
like
the
truth
the
old
woman
took
the
pledge
what
is
it
she
asked
once
more
scanning
raskolnikov
intently
and
weighing
the
pledge
in
her
hand
a
thing
cigarette
case
silver
look
at
it
it
does
not
seem
somehow
like
silver
how
he
has
wrapped
it
up
trying
to
untie
the
string
and
turning
to
the
window
to
the
light
all
her
windows
were
shut
in
spite
of
the
stifling
heat
she
left
him
altogether
for
some
seconds
and
stood
with
her
back
to
him
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
freed
the
axe
from
the
noose
but
did
not
yet
take
it
out
altogether
simply
holding
it
in
his
right
hand
under
the
coat
his
hands
were
fearfully
weak
he
felt
them
every
moment
growing
more
numb
and
more
wooden
he
was
afraid
he
would
let
the
axe
slip
and
fall
a
sudden
giddiness
came
over
him
but
what
has
he
tied
it
up
like
this
for
the
old
woman
cried
with
vexation
and
moved
towards
him
he
had
not
a
minute
more
to
lose
he
pulled
the
axe
quite
out
swung
it
with
both
arms
scarcely
conscious
of
himself
and
almost
without
effort
almost
mechanically
brought
the
blunt
side
down
on
her
head
he
seemed
not
to
use
his
own
strength
in
this
but
as
soon
as
he
had
once
brought
the
axe
down
his
strength
returned
to
him
the
old
woman
was
as
always
bareheaded
her
thin
light
hair
streaked
with
grey
thickly
smeared
with
grease
was
plaited
in
a
rat
s
tail
and
fastened
by
a
broken
horn
comb
which
stood
out
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
as
she
was
so
short
the
blow
fell
on
the
very
top
of
her
skull
she
cried
out
but
very
faintly
and
suddenly
sank
all
of
a
heap
on
the
floor
raising
her
hands
to
her
head
in
one
hand
she
still
held
the
pledge
then
he
dealt
her
another
and
another
blow
with
the
blunt
side
and
on
the
same
spot
the
blood
gushed
as
from
an
overturned
glass
the
body
fell
back
he
stepped
back
let
it
fall
and
at
once
bent
over
her
face
she
was
dead
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
starting
out
of
their
sockets
the
brow
and
the
whole
face
were
drawn
and
contorted
convulsively
he
laid
the
axe
on
the
ground
near
the
dead
body
and
felt
at
once
in
her
pocket
trying
to
avoid
the
streaming
body
the
same
right
hand
pocket
from
which
she
had
taken
the
key
on
his
last
visit
he
was
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
free
from
confusion
or
giddiness
but
his
hands
were
still
trembling
he
remembered
afterwards
that
he
had
been
particularly
collected
and
careful
trying
all
the
time
not
to
get
smeared
with
blood
he
pulled
out
the
keys
at
once
they
were
all
as
before
in
one
bunch
on
a
steel
ring
he
ran
at
once
into
the
bedroom
with
them
it
was
a
very
small
room
with
a
whole
shrine
of
holy
images
against
the
other
wall
stood
a
big
bed
very
clean
and
covered
with
a
silk
patchwork
wadded
quilt
against
a
third
wall
was
a
chest
of
drawers
strange
to
say
so
soon
as
he
began
to
fit
the
keys
into
the
chest
so
soon
as
he
heard
their
jingling
a
convulsive
shudder
passed
over
him
he
suddenly
felt
tempted
again
to
give
it
all
up
and
go
away
but
that
was
only
for
an
instant
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
he
positively
smiled
at
himself
when
suddenly
another
terrifying
idea
occurred
to
his
mind
he
suddenly
fancied
that
the
old
woman
might
be
still
alive
and
might
recover
her
senses
leaving
the
keys
in
the
chest
he
ran
back
to
the
body
snatched
up
the
axe
and
lifted
it
once
more
over
the
old
woman
but
did
not
bring
it
down
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
was
dead
bending
down
and
examining
her
again
more
closely
he
saw
clearly
that
the
skull
was
broken
and
even
battered
in
on
one
side
he
was
about
to
feel
it
with
his
finger
but
drew
back
his
hand
and
indeed
it
was
evident
without
that
meanwhile
there
was
a
perfect
pool
of
blood
all
at
once
he
noticed
a
string
on
her
neck
he
tugged
at
it
but
the
string
was
strong
and
did
not
snap
and
besides
it
was
soaked
with
blood
he
tried
to
pull
it
out
from
the
front
of
the
dress
but
something
held
it
and
prevented
its
coming
in
his
impatience
he
raised
the
axe
again
to
cut
the
string
from
above
on
the
body
but
did
not
dare
and
with
difficulty
smearing
his
hand
and
the
axe
in
the
blood
after
two
minutes
hurried
effort
he
cut
the
string
and
took
it
off
without
touching
the
body
with
the
axe
he
was
not
mistaken
it
was
a
purse
on
the
string
were
two
crosses
one
of
cyprus
wood
and
one
of
copper
and
an
image
in
silver
filigree
and
with
them
a
small
greasy
chamois
leather
purse
with
a
steel
rim
and
ring
the
purse
was
stuffed
very
full
raskolnikov
thrust
it
in
his
pocket
without
looking
at
it
flung
the
crosses
on
the
old
woman
s
body
and
rushed
back
into
the
bedroom
this
time
taking
the
axe
with
him
he
was
in
terrible
haste
he
snatched
the
keys
and
began
trying
them
again
but
he
was
unsuccessful
they
would
not
fit
in
the
locks
it
was
not
so
much
that
his
hands
were
shaking
but
that
he
kept
making
mistakes
though
he
saw
for
instance
that
a
key
was
not
the
right
one
and
would
not
fit
still
he
tried
to
put
it
in
suddenly
he
remembered
and
realised
that
the
big
key
with
the
deep
notches
which
was
hanging
there
with
the
small
keys
could
not
possibly
belong
to
the
chest
of
drawers
on
his
last
visit
this
had
struck
him
but
to
some
strong
box
and
that
everything
perhaps
was
hidden
in
that
box
he
left
the
chest
of
drawers
and
at
once
felt
under
the
bedstead
knowing
that
old
women
usually
keep
boxes
under
their
beds
and
so
it
was
there
was
a
good
sized
box
under
the
bed
at
least
a
yard
in
length
with
an
arched
lid
covered
with
red
leather
and
studded
with
steel
nails
the
notched
key
fitted
at
once
and
unlocked
it
at
the
top
under
a
white
sheet
was
a
coat
of
red
brocade
lined
with
hareskin
under
it
was
a
silk
dress
then
a
shawl
and
it
seemed
as
though
there
was
nothing
below
but
clothes
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
wipe
his
blood
stained
hands
on
the
red
brocade
it
s
red
and
on
red
blood
will
be
less
noticeable
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
then
he
suddenly
came
to
himself
good
god
am
i
going
out
of
my
senses
he
thought
with
terror
but
no
sooner
did
he
touch
the
clothes
than
a
gold
watch
slipped
from
under
the
fur
coat
he
made
haste
to
turn
them
all
over
there
turned
out
to
be
various
articles
made
of
gold
among
the
clothes
probably
all
pledges
unredeemed
or
waiting
to
be
redeemed
bracelets
chains
ear
rings
pins
and
such
things
some
were
in
cases
others
simply
wrapped
in
newspaper
carefully
and
exactly
folded
and
tied
round
with
tape
without
any
delay
he
began
filling
up
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
and
overcoat
without
examining
or
undoing
the
parcels
and
cases
but
he
had
not
time
to
take
many
he
suddenly
heard
steps
in
the
room
where
the
old
woman
lay
he
stopped
short
and
was
still
as
death
but
all
was
quiet
so
it
must
have
been
his
fancy
all
at
once
he
heard
distinctly
a
faint
cry
as
though
someone
had
uttered
a
low
broken
moan
then
again
dead
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
he
sat
squatting
on
his
heels
by
the
box
and
waited
holding
his
breath
suddenly
he
jumped
up
seized
the
axe
and
ran
out
of
the
bedroom
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
lizaveta
with
a
big
bundle
in
her
arms
she
was
gazing
in
stupefaction
at
her
murdered
sister
white
as
a
sheet
and
seeming
not
to
have
the
strength
to
cry
out
seeing
him
run
out
of
the
bedroom
she
began
faintly
quivering
all
over
like
a
leaf
a
shudder
ran
down
her
face
she
lifted
her
hand
opened
her
mouth
but
still
did
not
scream
she
began
slowly
backing
away
from
him
into
the
corner
staring
intently
persistently
at
him
but
still
uttered
no
sound
as
though
she
could
not
get
breath
to
scream
he
rushed
at
her
with
the
axe
her
mouth
twitched
piteously
as
one
sees
babies
mouths
when
they
begin
to
be
frightened
stare
intently
at
what
frightens
them
and
are
on
the
point
of
screaming
and
this
hapless
lizaveta
was
so
simple
and
had
been
so
thoroughly
crushed
and
scared
that
she
did
not
even
raise
a
hand
to
guard
her
face
though
that
was
the
most
necessary
and
natural
action
at
the
moment
for
the
axe
was
raised
over
her
face
she
only
put
up
her
empty
left
hand
but
not
to
her
face
slowly
holding
it
out
before
her
as
though
motioning
him
away
the
axe
fell
with
the
sharp
edge
just
on
the
skull
and
split
at
one
blow
all
the
top
of
the
head
she
fell
heavily
at
once
raskolnikov
completely
lost
his
head
snatching
up
her
bundle
dropped
it
again
and
ran
into
the
entry
fear
gained
more
and
more
mastery
over
him
especially
after
this
second
quite
unexpected
murder
he
longed
to
run
away
from
the
place
as
fast
as
possible
and
if
at
that
moment
he
had
been
capable
of
seeing
and
reasoning
more
correctly
if
he
had
been
able
to
realise
all
the
difficulties
of
his
position
the
hopelessness
the
hideousness
and
the
absurdity
of
it
if
he
could
have
understood
how
many
obstacles
and
perhaps
crimes
he
had
still
to
overcome
or
to
commit
to
get
out
of
that
place
and
to
make
his
way
home
it
is
very
possible
that
he
would
have
flung
up
everything
and
would
have
gone
to
give
himself
up
and
not
from
fear
but
from
simple
horror
and
loathing
of
what
he
had
done
the
feeling
of
loathing
especially
surged
up
within
him
and
grew
stronger
every
minute
he
would
not
now
have
gone
to
the
box
or
even
into
the
room
for
anything
in
the
world
but
a
sort
of
blankness
even
dreaminess
had
begun
by
degrees
to
take
possession
of
him
at
moments
he
forgot
himself
or
rather
forgot
what
was
of
importance
and
caught
at
trifles
glancing
however
into
the
kitchen
and
seeing
a
bucket
half
full
of
water
on
a
bench
he
bethought
him
of
washing
his
hands
and
the
axe
his
hands
were
sticky
with
blood
he
dropped
the
axe
with
the
blade
in
the
water
snatched
a
piece
of
soap
that
lay
in
a
broken
saucer
on
the
window
and
began
washing
his
hands
in
the
bucket
when
they
were
clean
he
took
out
the
axe
washed
the
blade
and
spent
a
long
time
about
three
minutes
washing
the
wood
where
there
were
spots
of
blood
rubbing
them
with
soap
then
he
wiped
it
all
with
some
linen
that
was
hanging
to
dry
on
a
line
in
the
kitchen
and
then
he
was
a
long
while
attentively
examining
the
axe
at
the
window
there
was
no
trace
left
on
it
only
the
wood
was
still
damp
he
carefully
hung
the
axe
in
the
noose
under
his
coat
then
as
far
as
was
possible
in
the
dim
light
in
the
kitchen
he
looked
over
his
overcoat
his
trousers
and
his
boots
at
the
first
glance
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
stains
on
the
boots
he
wetted
the
rag
and
rubbed
the
boots
but
he
knew
he
was
not
looking
thoroughly
that
there
might
be
something
quite
noticeable
that
he
was
overlooking
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
lost
in
thought
dark
agonising
ideas
rose
in
his
mind
the
idea
that
he
was
mad
and
that
at
that
moment
he
was
incapable
of
reasoning
of
protecting
himself
that
he
ought
perhaps
to
be
doing
something
utterly
different
from
what
he
was
now
doing
good
god
he
muttered
i
must
fly
fly
and
he
rushed
into
the
entry
but
here
a
shock
of
terror
awaited
him
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
he
stood
and
gazed
and
could
not
believe
his
eyes
the
door
the
outer
door
from
the
stairs
at
which
he
had
not
long
before
waited
and
rung
was
standing
unfastened
and
at
least
six
inches
open
no
lock
no
bolt
all
the
time
all
that
time
the
old
woman
had
not
shut
it
after
him
perhaps
as
a
precaution
but
good
god
why
he
had
seen
lizaveta
afterwards
and
how
could
he
how
could
he
have
failed
to
reflect
that
she
must
have
come
in
somehow
she
could
not
have
come
through
the
wall
he
dashed
to
the
door
and
fastened
the
latch
but
no
the
wrong
thing
again
i
must
get
away
get
away
he
unfastened
the
latch
opened
the
door
and
began
listening
on
the
staircase
he
listened
a
long
time
somewhere
far
away
it
might
be
in
the
gateway
two
voices
were
loudly
and
shrilly
shouting
quarrelling
and
scolding
what
are
they
about
he
waited
patiently
at
last
all
was
still
as
though
suddenly
cut
off
they
had
separated
he
was
meaning
to
go
out
but
suddenly
on
the
floor
below
a
door
was
noisily
opened
and
someone
began
going
downstairs
humming
a
tune
how
is
it
they
all
make
such
a
noise
flashed
through
his
mind
once
more
he
closed
the
door
and
waited
at
last
all
was
still
not
a
soul
stirring
he
was
just
taking
a
step
towards
the
stairs
when
he
heard
fresh
footsteps
the
steps
sounded
very
far
off
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
stairs
but
he
remembered
quite
clearly
and
distinctly
that
from
the
first
sound
he
began
for
some
reason
to
suspect
that
this
was
someone
coming
there
to
the
fourth
floor
to
the
old
woman
why
were
the
sounds
somehow
peculiar
significant
the
steps
were
heavy
even
and
unhurried
now
he
had
passed
the
first
floor
now
he
was
mounting
higher
it
was
growing
more
and
more
distinct
he
could
hear
his
heavy
breathing
and
now
the
third
storey
had
been
reached
coming
here
and
it
seemed
to
him
all
at
once
that
he
was
turned
to
stone
that
it
was
like
a
dream
in
which
one
is
being
pursued
nearly
caught
and
will
be
killed
and
is
rooted
to
the
spot
and
cannot
even
move
one
s
arms
at
last
when
the
unknown
was
mounting
to
the
fourth
floor
he
suddenly
started
and
succeeded
in
slipping
neatly
and
quickly
back
into
the
flat
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
then
he
took
the
hook
and
softly
noiselessly
fixed
it
in
the
catch
instinct
helped
him
when
he
had
done
this
he
crouched
holding
his
breath
by
the
door
the
unknown
visitor
was
by
now
also
at
the
door
they
were
now
standing
opposite
one
another
as
he
had
just
before
been
standing
with
the
old
woman
when
the
door
divided
them
and
he
was
listening
the
visitor
panted
several
times
he
must
be
a
big
fat
man
thought
raskolnikov
squeezing
the
axe
in
his
hand
it
seemed
like
a
dream
indeed
the
visitor
took
hold
of
the
bell
and
rang
it
loudly
as
soon
as
the
tin
bell
tinkled
raskolnikov
seemed
to
be
aware
of
something
moving
in
the
room
for
some
seconds
he
listened
quite
seriously
the
unknown
rang
again
waited
and
suddenly
tugged
violently
and
impatiently
at
the
handle
of
the
door
raskolnikov
gazed
in
horror
at
the
hook
shaking
in
its
fastening
and
in
blank
terror
expected
every
minute
that
the
fastening
would
be
pulled
out
it
certainly
did
seem
possible
so
violently
was
he
shaking
it
he
was
tempted
to
hold
the
fastening
but
he
might
be
aware
of
it
a
giddiness
came
over
him
again
i
shall
fall
down
flashed
through
his
mind
but
the
unknown
began
to
speak
and
he
recovered
himself
at
once
what
s
up
are
they
asleep
or
murdered
d
damn
them
he
bawled
in
a
thick
voice
hey
alyona
ivanovna
old
witch
lizaveta
ivanovna
hey
my
beauty
open
the
door
oh
damn
them
are
they
asleep
or
what
and
again
enraged
he
tugged
with
all
his
might
a
dozen
times
at
the
bell
he
must
certainly
be
a
man
of
authority
and
an
intimate
acquaintance
at
this
moment
light
hurried
steps
were
heard
not
far
off
on
the
stairs
someone
else
was
approaching
raskolnikov
had
not
heard
them
at
first
you
don
t
say
there
s
no
one
at
home
the
new
comer
cried
in
a
cheerful
ringing
voice
addressing
the
first
visitor
who
still
went
on
pulling
the
bell
good
evening
koch
from
his
voice
he
must
be
quite
young
thought
raskolnikov
who
the
devil
can
tell
i
ve
almost
broken
the
lock
answered
koch
but
how
do
you
come
to
know
me
why
the
day
before
yesterday

beat
you
three
times
running
at
billiards
at
gambrinus
oh
so
they
are
not
at
home
that
s
queer
it
s
awfully
stupid
though
where
could
the
old
woman
have
gone
i
ve
come
on
business
yes
and
i
have
business
with
her
too
well
what

suppose

and
i
was
hoping
to
get
some
money
cried
the
young
man
we
must
give
it
up
of
course
but
what
did
she
fix
this
time
for
the
old
witch
fixed
the
time
for
me
to
come
herself

s
out
of
my
way
and
where
the
devil
she
can
have
got
to
i
can
t
make
out

here
from
year
s
end
to
year

end
the
old
hag
her
legs
are
bad
and
yet
here
all
of
a
sudden
she
is
out
for
a
walk
hadn
t
we
better
ask
the
porter
what
where
she
s
gone
and
when
she
ll
be
back
hm
damn
it
all
we
might
ask
but
you
know
she
never
does
go
anywhere
and
he
once
more
tugged
at
the
door
handle
damn
it
all
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
we
must
go
stay
cried
the
young
man
suddenly
do
you
see
how
the
door
shakes
if
you
pull
it
well
that
shows
it
s
not
locked
but
fastened
with
the
hook
do
you
hear
how
the
hook
clanks
well
why
don
t
you
see
that
proves
that
one
of
them
is
at
home
if
they
were
all
out
they
would
have
locked
the
door
from
the
outside
with
the
key
and
not
with
the
hook
from
inside
there
do
you
hear
how
the
hook
is
clanking
to
fasten
the
hook
on
the
inside
they
must
be
at
home
don
t
you
see
so
there
they
are
sitting
inside
and
don
t
open
the
door
well
and
so
they
must
be
cried
koch
astonished
what
are
they
about
in
there
and
he
began
furiously
shaking
the
door
stay
cried
the
young
man
again
don
t
pull
at
it
there
must
be
something
wrong
here
you
ve
been
ringing
and
pulling
at
the
door
and
still
they
don
t
open
so
either
they
ve
both
fainted
or
what
i
tell
you
what
let
s
go
fetch
the
porter
let
him
wake
them
up
all
right
both
were
going
down

stop
here
while
i
run
down
for
the
porter
what
for
well

better
all
right
i
m
studying
the
law
you
see
it
s
evident
e
vi
dent
there
s
something
wrong
here
the
young
man
cried
hotly
and
he
ran
downstairs
koch
remained
once
more
he
softly
touched
the
bell
which
gave
one
tinkle
then
gently
as
though
reflecting
and
looking
about
him
began
touching
the
door
handle
pulling
it
and
letting
it
go
to
make
sure
once
more
that
it
was
only
fastened
by
the
hook
then
puffing
and
panting
he
bent
down
and
began
looking
at
the
keyhole
but
the
key
was
in
the
lock
on
the
inside
and
so
nothing
could
be
seen
raskolnikov
stood
keeping
tight
hold
of
the
axe
he
was
in
a
sort
of
delirium
he
was
even
making
ready
to
fight
when
they
should
come
in
while
they
were
knocking
and
talking
together
the
idea
several
times
occurred
to
him
to
end
it
all
at
once
and
shout
to
them
through
the
door
now
and
then
he
was
tempted
to
swear
at
them
to
jeer
at
them
while
they
could
not
open
the
door
only
make
haste
was
the
thought
that
flashed
through
his
mind
but
what
the
devil
is
he
about
time
was
passing
one
minute
and
another
no
one
came
koch
began
to
be
restless
what
the
devil
he
cried
suddenly
and
in
impatience
deserting
his
sentry
duty
he
too
went
down
hurrying
and
thumping
with
his
heavy
boots
on
the
stairs
the
steps
died
away
good
heavens
what
am
i
to
do
raskolnikov
unfastened
the
hook
opened
the
door
there
was
no
sound
abruptly
without
any
thought
at
all
he
went
out
closing
the
door
as
thoroughly
as
he
could
and
went
downstairs
he
had
gone
down
three
flights
when
he
suddenly
heard
a
loud
voice
below
where
could
he
go
there
was
nowhere
to
hide
he
was
just
going
back
to
the
flat
hey
there
catch
the
brute
somebody
dashed
out
of
a
flat
below
shouting
and
rather
fell
than
ran
down
the
stairs
bawling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
mitka
mitka
mitka
mitka
mitka
blast
him
the
shout
ended
in
a
shriek
the
last
sounds
came
from
the
yard
all
was
still
but
at
the
same
instant
several
men
talking
loud
and
fast
began
noisily
mounting
the
stairs
there
were
three
or
four
of
them
he
distinguished
the
ringing
voice
of
the
young
man
hey
filled
with
despair
he
went
straight
to
meet
them
feeling
come
what
must
if
they
stopped
him
all
was
lost
if
they
let
him
pass
all
was
lost
too
they
would
remember
him
they
were
approaching
they
were
only
a
flight
from
him
and
suddenly
deliverance
a
few
steps
from
him
on
the
right
there
was
an
empty
flat
with
the
door
wide
open
the
flat
on
the
second
floor
where
the
painters
had
been
at
work
and
which
as
though
for
his
benefit
they
had
just
left
it
was
they
no
doubt
who
had
just
run
down
shouting
the
floor
had
only
just
been
painted
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
pail
and
a
broken
pot
with
paint
and
brushes
in
one
instant
he
had
whisked
in
at
the
open
door
and
hidden
behind
the
wall
and
only
in
the
nick
of
time
they
had
already
reached
the
landing
then
they
turned
and
went
on
up
to
the
fourth
floor
talking
loudly
he
waited
went
out
on
tiptoe
and
ran
down
the
stairs
no
one
was
on
the
stairs
nor
in
the
gateway
he
passed
quickly
through
the
gateway
and
turned
to
the
left
in
the
street
he
knew
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
at
that
moment
they
were
at
the
flat
that
they
were
greatly
astonished
at
finding
it
unlocked
as
the
door
had
just
been
fastened
that
by
now
they
were
looking
at
the
bodies
that
before
another
minute
had
passed
they
would
guess
and
completely
realise
that
the
murderer
had
just
been
there
and
had
succeeded
in
hiding
somewhere
slipping
by
them
and
escaping
they
would
guess
most
likely
that
he
had
been
in
the
empty
flat
while
they
were
going
upstairs
and
meanwhile
he
dared
not
quicken
his
pace
much
though
the
next
turning
was
still
nearly
a
hundred
yards
away
should
he
slip
through
some
gateway
and
wait
somewhere
in
an
unknown
street
no
hopeless
should
he
fling
away
the
axe
should
he
take
a
cab
hopeless
hopeless
at
last
he
reached
the
turning
he
turned
down
it
more
dead
than
alive
here
he
was
half
way
to
safety
and
he
understood
it
it
was
less
risky
because
there
was
a
great
crowd
of
people
and
he
was
lost
in
it
like
a
grain
of
sand
but
all
he
had
suffered
had
so
weakened
him
that
he
could
scarcely
move
perspiration
ran
down
him
in
drops
his
neck
was
all
wet
my
word
he
has
been
going
it
someone
shouted
at
him
when
he
came
out
on
the
canal
bank
he
was
only
dimly
conscious
of
himself
now
and
the
farther
he
went
the
worse
it
was
he
remembered
however
that
on
coming
out
on
to
the
canal
bank
he
was
alarmed
at
finding
few
people
there
and
so
being
more
conspicuous
and
he
had
thought
of
turning
back
though
he
was
almost
falling
from
fatigue
he
went
a
long
way
round
so
as
to
get
home
from
quite
a
different
direction
he
was
not
fully
conscious
when
he
passed
through
the
gateway
of
his
house
he
was
already
on
the
staircase
before
he
recollected
the
axe
and
yet
he
had
a
very
grave
problem
before
him
to
put
it
back
and
to
escape
observation
as
far
as
possible
in
doing
so
he
was
of
course
incapable
of
reflecting
that
it
might
perhaps
be
far
better
not
to
restore
the
axe
at
all
but
to
drop
it
later
on
in
somebody
s
yard
but
it
all
happened
fortunately
the
door
of
the
porter
s
room
was
closed
but
not
locked
so
that
it
seemed
most
likely
that
the
porter
was
at
home
but
he
had
so
completely
lost
all
power
of
reflection
that
he
walked
straight
to
the
door
and
opened
it
if
the
porter
had
asked
him
what
do
you
want
he
would
perhaps
have
simply
handed
him
the
axe
but
again
the
porter
was
not
at
home
and
he
succeeded
in
putting
the
axe
back
under
the
bench
and
even
covering
it
with
the
chunk
of
wood
as
before
he
met
no
one
not
a
soul
afterwards
on
the
way
to
his
room
the
landlady
s
door
was
shut
when
he
was
in
his
room
he
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
just
as
he
was
he
did
not
sleep
but
sank
into
blank
forgetfulness
if
anyone
had
come
into
his
room
then
he
would
have
jumped
up
at
once
and
screamed
scraps
and
shreds
of
thoughts
were
simply
swarming
in
his
brain
but
he
could
not
catch
at
one
he
could
not
rest
on
one
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
part
ii
chapter
i
so
he
lay
a
very
long
while
now
and
then
he
seemed
to
wake
up
and
at
such
moments
he
noticed
that
it
was
far
into
the
night
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
get
up
at
last
he
noticed
that
it
was
beginning
to
get
light
he
was
lying
on
his
back
still
dazed
from
his
recent
oblivion
fearful
despairing
cries
rose
shrilly
from
the
street
sounds
which
he
heard
every
night
indeed
under
his
window
after
two
o
clock
they
woke
him
up
now
ah
the
drunken
men
are
coming
out
of
the
taverns
he
thought
it
s
past
two
o
clock
and
at
once
he
leaped
up
as
though
someone
had
pulled
him
from
the
sofa
what
past
two
o
clock
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
instantly
recollected
everything
all
at
once
in
one
flash
he
recollected
everything
for
the
first
moment
he
thought
he
was
going
mad
a
dreadful
chill
came
over
him
but
the
chill
was
from
the
fever
that
had
begun
long
before
in
his
sleep
now
he
was
suddenly
taken
with
violent
shivering
so
that
his
teeth
chattered
and
all
his
limbs
were
shaking
he
opened
the
door
and
began
listening
everything
in
the
house
was
asleep
with
amazement
he
gazed
at
himself
and
everything
in
the
room
around
him
wondering
how
he
could
have
come
in
the
night
before
without
fastening
the
door
and
have
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
without
undressing
without
even
taking
his
hat
off
it
had
fallen
off
and
was
lying
on
the
floor
near
his
pillow
if
anyone
had
come
in
what
would
he
have
thought
that
i
m
drunk
but
he
rushed
to
the
window
there
was
light
enough
and
he
began
hurriedly
looking
himself
all
over
from
head
to
foot
all
his
clothes
were
there
no
traces
but
there
was
no
doing
it
like
that
shivering
with
cold
he
began
taking
off
everything
and
looking
over
again
he
turned
everything
over
to
the
last
threads
and
rags
and
mistrusting
himself
went
through
his
search
three
times
but
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
no
trace
except
in
one
place
where
some
thick
drops
of
congealed
blood
were
clinging
to
the
frayed
edge
of
his
trousers
he
picked
up
a
big
claspknife
and
cut
off
the
frayed
threads
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
suddenly
he
remembered
that
the
purse
and
the
things
he
had
taken
out
of
the
old
woman
s
box
were
still
in
his
pockets
he
had
not
thought
till
then
of
taking
them
out
and
hiding
them
he
had
not
even
thought
of
them
while
he
was
examining
his
clothes
what
next
instantly
he
rushed
to
take
them
out
and
fling
them
on
the
table
when
he
had
pulled
out
everything
and
turned
the
pocket
inside
out
to
be
sure
there
was
nothing
left
he
carried
the
whole
heap
to
the
corner
the
paper
had
come
off
the
bottom
of
the
wall
and
hung
there
in
tatters
he
began
stuffing
all
the
things
into
the
hole
under
the
paper
they
re
in
all
out
of
sight
and
the
purse
too
he
thought
gleefully
getting
up
and
gazing
blankly
at
the
hole
which
bulged
out
more
than
ever
suddenly
he
shuddered
all
over
with
horror
my
god
he
whispered
in
despair
what
s
the
matter
with
me
is
that
hidden
is
that
the
way
to
hide
things
he
had
not
reckoned
on
having
trinkets
to
hide
he
had
only
thought
of
money
and
so
had
not
prepared
a
hiding
place
but
now
now
what
am
i
glad
of
he
thought
is
that
hiding
things
my
reason
s
deserting
me
simply
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
exhaustion
and
was
at
once
shaken
by
another
unbearable
fit
of
shivering
mechanically
he
drew
from
a
chair
beside
him
his
old
student
s
winter
coat
which
was
still
warm
though
almost
in
rags
covered
himself
up
with
it
and
once
more
sank
into
drowsiness
and
delirium
he
lost
consciousness
not
more
than
five
minutes
had
passed
when
he
jumped
up
a
second
time
and
at
once
pounced
in
a
frenzy
on
his
clothes
again
how
could
i
go
to
sleep
again
with
nothing
done
yes
yes
i
have
not
taken
the
loop
off
the
armhole
i
forgot
it
forgot
a
thing
like
that
such
a
piece
of
evidence
he
pulled
off
the
noose
hurriedly
cut
it
to
pieces
and
threw
the
bits
among
his
linen
under
the
pillow
pieces
of
torn
linen
couldn
t
rouse
suspicion
whatever
happened
i
think
not
i
think
not
any
way
he
repeated
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
with
painful
concentration
he
fell
to
gazing
about
him
again
at
the
floor
and
everywhere
trying
to
make
sure
he
had
not
forgotten
anything
the
conviction
that
all
his
faculties
even
memory
and
the
simplest
power
of
reflection
were
failing
him
began
to
be
an
insufferable
torture
surely
it
isn
t
beginning
already
surely
it
isn
t
my
punishment
coming
upon
me
it
is
the
frayed
rags
he
had
cut
off
his
trousers
were
actually
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
where
anyone
coming
in
would
see
them
what
is
the
matter
with
me
he
cried
again
like
one
distraught
then
a
strange
idea
entered
his
head
that
perhaps
all
his
clothes
were
covered
with
blood
that
perhaps
there
were
a
great
many
stains
but
that
he
did
not
see
them
did
not
notice
them
because
his
perceptions
were
failing
were
going
to
pieces
his
reason
was
clouded
suddenly
he
remembered
that
there
had
been
blood
on
the
purse
too
ah
then
there
must
be
blood
on
the
pocket
too
for
i
put
the
wet
purse
in
my
pocket
in
a
flash
he
had
turned
the
pocket
inside
out
and
yes
there
were
traces
stains
on
the
lining
of
the
pocket
so
my
reason
has
not
quite
deserted
me
so
i
still
have
some
sense
and
memory
since
i
guessed
it
of
myself
he
thought
triumphantly
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
it
s
simply
the
weakness
of
fever
a
moment
s
delirium
and
he
tore
the
whole
lining
out
of
the
left
pocket
of
his
trousers
at
that
instant
the
sunlight
fell
on
his
left
boot
on
the
sock
which
poked
out
from
the
boot
he
fancied
there
were
traces
he
flung
off
his
boots
traces
indeed
the
tip
of
the
sock
was
soaked
with
blood
he
must
have
unwarily
stepped
into
that
pool
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
now
where
am
i
to
put
the
sock
and
rags
and
pocket
he
gathered
them
all
up
in
his
hands
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
the
stove
but
they
would
ransack
the
stove
first
of
all
burn
them
but
what
can
i
burn
them
with
there
are
no
matches
even
no
better
go
out
and
throw
it
all
away
somewhere
yes
better
throw
it
away
he
repeated
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
again
and
at
once
this
minute
without
lingering
but
his
head
sank
on
the
pillow
instead
again
the
unbearable
icy
shivering
came
over
him
again
he
drew
his
coat
over
him
and
for
a
long
while
for
some
hours
he
was
haunted
by
the
impulse
to
go
off
somewhere
at
once
this
moment
and
fling
it
all
away
so
that
it
may
be
out
of
sight
and
done
with
at
once
at
once
several
times
he
tried
to
rise
from
the
sofa
but
could
not
he
was
thoroughly
waked
up
at
last
by
a
violent
knocking
at
his
door
open
do
are
you
dead
or
alive
he
keeps
sleeping
here
shouted
nastasya
banging
with
her
fist
on
the
door
for
whole
days
together
he
s
snoring
here
like
a
dog
a
dog
he
is
too
open
i
tell
you
it
s
past
ten
maybe
he
s
not
at
home
said
a
man
s
voice
ha
that
s
the
porter
s
voice
what
does
he
want
he
jumped
up
and
sat
on
the
sofa
the
beating
of
his
heart
was
a
positive
pain
then
who
can
have
latched
the
door
retorted
nastasya
he
s
taken
to
bolting
himself
in
as
if
he
were
worth
stealing
open
you
stupid
wake
up
what
do
they
want
why
the
porter
all
s
discovered
resist
or
open
come
what
may
he
half
rose
stooped
forward
and
unlatched
the
door
his
room
was
so
small
that
he
could
undo
the
latch
without
leaving
the
bed
yes
the
porter
and
nastasya
were
standing
there
nastasya
stared
at
him
in
a
strange
way
he
glanced
with
a
defiant
and
desperate
air
at
the
porter
who
without
a
word
held
out
a
grey
folded
paper
sealed
with
bottle
wax
a
notice
from
the
office
he
announced
as
he
gave
him
the
paper
from
what
office
a
summons
to
the
police
office
of
course
you
know
which
office
to
the
police
what
for
how
can
i
tell
you
re
sent
for
so
you
go
the
man
looked
at
him
attentively
looked
round
the
room
and
turned
to
go
away
he
s
downright
ill
observed
nastasya
not
taking
her
eyes
off
him
the
porter
turned
his
head
for
a
moment
he
s
been
in
a
fever
since
yesterday
she
added
raskolnikov
made
no
response
and
held
the
paper
in
his
hands
without
opening
it
don
t
you
get
up
then
nastasya
went
on
compassionately
seeing
that
he
was
letting
his
feet
down
from
the
sofa
you
re
ill
and
so
don
t
go
there
s
no
such
hurry
what
have
you
got
there
he
looked
in
his
right
hand
he
held
the
shreds
he
had
cut
from
his
trousers
the
sock
and
the
rags
of
the
pocket
so
he
had
been
asleep
with
them
in
his
hand
afterwards
reflecting
upon
it
he
remembered
that
half
waking
up
in
his
fever
he
had
grasped
all
this
tightly
in
his
hand
and
so
fallen
asleep
again
look
at
the
rags
he
s
collected
and
sleeps
with
them
as
though
he
has
got
hold
of
a
treasure
and
nastasya
went
off
into
her
hysterical
giggle
instantly
he
thrust
them
all
under
his
great
coat
and
fixed
his
eyes
intently
upon
her
far
as
he
was
from
being
capable
of
rational
reflection
at
that
moment
he
felt
that
no
one
would
behave
like
that
with
a
person
who
was
going
to
be
arrested
but
the
police
you
d
better
have
some
tea
yes
i
ll
bring
it
there
s
some
left
no
i
m
going
i
ll
go
at
once
he
muttered
getting
on
to
his
feet
why
you
ll
never
get
downstairs
yes
i
ll
go
as
you
please
she
followed
the
porter
out
at
once
he
rushed
to
the
light
to
examine
the
sock
and
the
rags
there
are
stains
but
not
very
noticeable
all
covered
with
dirt
and
rubbed
and
already
discoloured
no
one
who
had
no
suspicion
could
distinguish
anything
nastasya
from
a
distance
could
not
have
noticed
thank
god
then
with
a
tremor
he
broke
the
seal
of
the
notice
and
began
reading
he
was
a
long
while
reading
before
he
understood
it
was
an
ordinary
summons
from
the
district
police
station
to
appear
that
day
at
half
past
nine
at
the
office
of
the
district
superintendent
but
when
has
such
a
thing
happened
i
never
have
anything
to
do
with
the
police
and
why
just
to
day
he
thought
in
agonising
bewilderment
good
god
only
get
it
over
soon
he
was
flinging
himself
on
his
knees
to
pray
but
broke
into
laughter
not
at
the
idea
of
prayer
but
at
himself
he
began
hurriedly
dressing
if
i
m
lost
i
am
lost
i
don
t
care
shall
i
put
the
sock
on
he
suddenly
wondered
it
will
get
dustier
still
and
the
traces
will
be
gone
but
no
sooner
had
he
put
it
on
than
he
pulled
it
off
again
in
loathing
and
horror
he
pulled
it
off
but
reflecting
that
he
had
no
other
socks
he
picked
it
up
and
put
it
on
again
and
again
he
laughed
that
s
all
conventional
that
s
all
relative
merely
a
way
of
looking
at
it
he
thought
in
a
flash
but
only
on
the
top
surface
of
his
mind
while
he
was
shuddering
all
over
there
i
ve
got
it
on
i
have
finished
by
getting
it
on
but
his
laughter
was
quickly
followed
by
despair
no
it
s
too
much
for
me
he
thought
his
legs
shook
from
fear
he
muttered
his
head
swam
and
ached
with
fever
it
s
a
trick
they
want
to
decoy
me
there
and
confound
me
over
everything
he
mused
as
he
went
out
on
to
the
stairs
the
worst
of
it
is
i
m
almost
light
headed
i
may
blurt
out
something
stupid
on
the
stairs
he
remembered
that
he
was
leaving
all
the
things
just
as
they
were
in
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
very
likely
it
s
on
purpose
to
search
when
i
m
out
he
thought
and
stopped
short
but
he
was
possessed
by
such
despair
such
cynicism
of
misery
if
one
may
so
call
it
that
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
went
on
only
to
get
it
over
in
the
street
the
heat
was
insufferable
again
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
all
those
days
again
dust
bricks
and
mortar
again
the
stench
from
the
shops
and
pot
houses
again
the
drunken
men
the
finnish
pedlars
and
half
broken
down
cabs
the
sun
shone
straight
in
his
eyes
so
that
it
hurt
him
to
look
out
of
them
and
he
felt
his
head
going
round
as
a
man
in
a
fever
is
apt
to
feel
when
he
comes
out
into
the
street
on
a
bright
sunny
day
when
he
reached
the
turning
into
the
street
in
an
agony
of
trepidation
he
looked
down
it
at
the
house
and
at
once
averted
his
eyes
if
they
question
me
perhaps
i
ll
simply
tell
he
thought
as
he
drew
near
the
police
station
the
police
station
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
it
had
lately
been
moved
to
new
rooms
on
the
fourth
floor
of
a
new
house
he
had
been
once
for
a
moment
in
the
old
office
but
long
ago
turning
in
at
the
gateway
he
saw
on
the
right
a
flight
of
stairs
which
a
peasant
was
mounting
with
a
book
in
his
hand
a
house
porter
no
doubt
so
then
the
office
is
here
and
he
began
ascending
the
stairs
on
the
chance
he
did
not
want
to
ask
questions
of
anyone
i
ll
go
in
fall
on
my
knees
and
confess
everything
he
thought
as
he
reached
the
fourth
floor
the
staircase
was
steep
narrow
and
all
sloppy
with
dirty
water
the
kitchens
of
the
flats
opened
on
to
the
stairs
and
stood
open
almost
the
whole
day
so
there
was
a
fearful
smell
and
heat
the
staircase
was
crowded
with
porters
going
up
and
down
with
their
books
under
their
arms
policemen
and
persons
of
all
sorts
and
both
sexes
the
door
of
the
office
too
stood
wide
open
peasants
stood
waiting
within
there
too
the
heat
was
stifling
and
there
was
a
sickening
smell
of
fresh
paint
and
stale
oil
from
the
newly
decorated
rooms
after
waiting
a
little
he
decided
to
move
forward
into
the
next
room
all
the
rooms
were
small
and
low
pitched
a
fearful
impatience
drew
him
on
and
on
no
one
paid
attention
to
him
in
the
second
room
some
clerks
sat
writing
dressed
hardly
better
than
he
was
and
rather
a
queer
looking
set
he
went
up
to
one
of
them
what
is
it
he
showed
the
notice
he
had
received
you
are
a
student
the
man
asked
glancing
at
the
notice
yes
formerly
a
student
the
clerk
looked
at
him
but
without
the
slightest
interest
he
was
a
particularly
unkempt
person
with
the
look
of
a
fixed
idea
in
his
eye
there
would
be
no
getting
anything
out
of
him
because
he
has
no
interest
in
anything
thought
raskolnikov
go
in
there
to
the
head
clerk
said
the
clerk
pointing
towards
the
furthest
room
he
went
into
that
room
the
fourth
in
order
it
was
a
small
room
and
packed
full
of
people
rather
better
dressed
than
in
the
outer
rooms
among
them
were
two
ladies
one
poorly
dressed
in
mourning
sat
at
the
table
opposite
the
chief
clerk
writing
something
at
his
dictation
the
other
a
very
stout
buxom
woman
with
a
purplish
red
blotchy
face
excessively
smartly
dressed
with
a
brooch
on
her
bosom
as
big
as
a
saucer
was
standing
on
one
side
apparently
waiting
for
something
raskolnikov
thrust
his
notice
upon
the
head
clerk
the
latter
glanced
at
it
said
wait
a
minute
and
went
on
attending
to
the
lady
in
mourning
he
breathed
more
freely
it
can
t
be
that
by
degrees
he
began
to
regain
confidence
he
kept
urging
himself
to
have
courage
and
be
calm
some
foolishness
some
trifling
carelessness
and
i
may
betray
myself
hm
it
s
a
pity
there
s
no
air
here
he
added
it
s
stifling
it
makes
one
s
head
dizzier
than
ever
and
one
s
mind
too
he
was
conscious
of
a
terrible
inner
turmoil
he
was
afraid
of
losing
his
self
control
he
tried
to
catch
at
something
and
fix
his
mind
on
it
something
quite
irrelevant
but
he
could
not
succeed
in
this
at
all
yet
the
head
clerk
greatly
interested
him
he
kept
hoping
to
see
through
him
and
guess
something
from
his
face
he
was
a
very
young
man
about
two
and
twenty
with
a
dark
mobile
face
that
looked
older
than
his
years
he
was
fashionably
dressed
and
foppish
with
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
well
combed
and
pomaded
and
wore
a
number
of
rings
on
his
well
scrubbed
fingers
and
a
gold
chain
on
his
waistcoat
he
said
a
couple
of
words
in
french
to
a
foreigner
who
was
in
the
room
and
said
them
fairly
correctly
luise
ivanovna
you
can
sit
down
he
said
casually
to
the
gaily
dressed
purple
faced
lady
who
was
still
standing
as
though
not
venturing
to
sit
down
though
there
was
a
chair
beside
her
ich
danke
said
the
latter
and
softly
with
a
rustle
of
silk
she
sank
into
the
chair
her
light
blue
dress
trimmed
with
white
lace
floated
about
the
table
like
an
air
balloon
and
filled
almost
half
the
room
she
smelt
of
scent
but
she
was
obviously
embarrassed
at
filling
half
the
room
and
smelling
so
strongly
of
scent
and
though
her
smile
was
impudent
as
well
as
cringing
it
betrayed
evident
uneasiness
the
lady
in
mourning
had
done
at
last
and
got
up
all
at
once
with
some
noise
an
officer
walked
in
very
jauntily
with
a
peculiar
swing
of
his
shoulders
at
each
step
he
tossed
his
cockaded
cap
on
the
table
and
sat
down
in
an
easy
chair
the
small
lady
positively
skipped
from
her
seat
on
seeing
him
and
fell
to
curtsying
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
but
the
officer
took
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
and
she
did
not
venture
to
sit
down
again
in
his
presence
he
was
the
assistant
superintendent
he
had
a
reddish
moustache
that
stood
out
horizontally
on
each
side
of
his
face
and
extremely
small
features
expressive
of
nothing
much
except
a
certain
insolence
he
looked
askance
and
rather
indignantly
at
raskolnikov
he
was
so
very
badly
dressed
and
in
spite
of
his
humiliating
position
his
bearing
was
by
no
means
in
keeping
with
his
clothes
raskolnikov
had
unwarily
fixed
a
very
long
and
direct
look
on
him
so
that
he
felt
positively
affronted
what
do
you
want
he
shouted
apparently
astonished
that
such
a
ragged
fellow
was
not
annihilated
by
the
majesty
of
his
glance
i
was
summoned
by
a
notice
raskolnikov
faltered
for
the
recovery
of
money
due
from
the
student
the
head
clerk
interfered
hurriedly
tearing
himself
from
his
papers
here
and
he
flung
raskolnikov
a
document
and
pointed
out
the
place
read
that
money
what
money
thought
raskolnikov
but
then
it
s
certainly
not
that
and
he
trembled
with
joy
he
felt
sudden
intense
indescribable
relief
a
load
was
lifted
from
his
back
and
pray
what
time
were
you
directed
to
appear
sir
shouted
the
assistant
superintendent
seeming
for
some
unknown
reason
more
and
more
aggrieved
you
are
told
to
come
at
nine
and
now
it
s
twelve
the
notice
was
only
brought
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
raskolnikov
answered
loudly
over
his
shoulder
to
his
own
surprise
he
too
grew
suddenly
angry
and
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
it
and
it
s
enough
that
i
have
come
here
ill
with
fever
kindly
refrain
from
shouting
i
m
not
shouting
i
m
speaking
very
quietly
it
s
you
who
are
shouting
at
me
i
m
a
student
and
allow
no
one
to
shout
at
me
the
assistant
superintendent
was
so
furious
that
for
the
first
minute
he
could
only
splutter
inarticulately
he
leaped
up
from
his
seat
be
silent
you
are
in
a
government
office
don
t
be
impudent
sir
you
re
in
a
government
office
too
cried
raskolnikov
and
you
re
smoking
a
cigarette
as
well
as
shouting
so
you
are
showing
disrespect
to
all
of
us
he
felt
an
indescribable
satisfaction
at
having
said
this
the
head
clerk
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
the
angry
assistant
superintendent
was
obviously
disconcerted
that
s
not
your
business
he
shouted
at
last
with
unnatural
loudness
kindly
make
the
declaration
demanded
of
you
show
him
alexandr
grigorievitch
there
is
a
complaint
against
you
you
don
t
pay
your
debts
you
re
a
fine
bird
but
raskolnikov
was
not
listening
now
he
had
eagerly
clutched
at
the
paper
in
haste
to
find
an
explanation
he
read
it
once
and
a
second
time
and
still
did
not
understand
what
is
this
he
asked
the
head
clerk
it
is
for
the
recovery
of
money
on
an
i
o
u
a
writ
you
must
either
pay
it
with
all
expenses
costs
and
so
on
or
give
a
written
declaration
when
you
can
pay
it
and
at
the
same
time
an
undertaking
not
to
leave
the
capital
without
payment
and
nor
to
sell
or
conceal
your
property
the
creditor
is
at
liberty
to
sell
your
property
and
proceed
against
you
according
to
the
law
but
i
am
not
in
debt
to
anyone
that
s
not
our
business
here
an
i
o
u
for
a
hundred
and
fifteen
roubles
legally
attested
and
due
for
payment
has
been
brought
us
for
recovery
given
by
you
to
the
widow
of
the
assessor
zarnitsyn
nine
months
ago
and
paid
over
by
the
widow
zarnitsyn
to
one
mr
tchebarov
we
therefore
summon
you
hereupon
but
she
is
my
landlady
and
what
if
she
is
your
landlady
the
head
clerk
looked
at
him
with
a
condescending
smile
of
compassion
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
certain
triumph
as
at
a
novice
under
fire
for
the
first
time
as
though
he
would
say
well
how
do
you
feel
now
but
what
did
he
care
now
for
an
i
o
u
for
a
writ
of
recovery
was
that
worth
worrying
about
now
was
it
worth
attention
even
he
stood
he
read
he
listened
he
answered
he
even
asked
questions
himself
but
all
mechanically
the
triumphant
sense
of
security
of
deliverance
from
overwhelming
danger
that
was
what
filled
his
whole
soul
that
moment
without
thought
for
the
future
without
analysis
without
suppositions
or
surmises
without
doubts
and
without
questioning
it
was
an
instant
of
full
direct
purely
instinctive
joy
but
at
that
very
moment
something
like
a
thunderstorm
took
place
in
the
office
the
assistant
superintendent
still
shaken
by
raskolnikov
s
disrespect
still
fuming
and
obviously
anxious
to
keep
up
his
wounded
dignity
pounced
on
the
unfortunate
smart
lady
who
had
been
gazing
at
him
ever
since
he
came
in
with
an
exceedingly
silly
smile
you
shameful
hussy
he
shouted
suddenly
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
lady
in
mourning
had
left
the
office
what
was
going
on
at
your
house
last
night
eh
a
disgrace
again
you
re
a
scandal
to
the
whole
street
fighting
and
drinking
again
do
you
want
the
house
of
correction
why
i
have
warned
you
ten
times
over
that
i
would
not
let
you
off
the
eleventh
and
here
you
are
again
again
you
you
the
paper
fell
out
of
raskolnikov
s
hands
and
he
looked
wildly
at
the
smart
lady
who
was
so
unceremoniously
treated
but
he
soon
saw
what
it
meant
and
at
once
began
to
find
positive
amusement
in
the
scandal
he
listened
with
pleasure
so
that
he
longed
to
laugh
and
laugh
all
his
nerves
were
on
edge
ilya
petrovitch
the
head
clerk
was
beginning
anxiously
but
stopped
short
for
he
knew
from
experience
that
the
enraged
assistant
could
not
be
stopped
except
by
force
as
for
the
smart
lady
at
first
she
positively
trembled
before
the
storm
but
strange
to
say
the
more
numerous
and
violent
the
terms
of
abuse
became
the
more
amiable
she
looked
and
the
more
seductive
the
smiles
she
lavished
on
the
terrible
assistant
she
moved
uneasily
and
curtsied
incessantly
waiting
impatiently
for
a
chance
of
putting
in
her
word
and
at
last
she
found
it
there
was
no
sort
of
noise
or
fighting
in
my
house
mr
captain
she
pattered
all
at
once
like
peas
dropping
speaking
russian
confidently
though
with
a
strong
german
accent
and
no
sort
of
scandal
and
his
honour
came
drunk
and
it
s
the
whole
truth
i
am
telling
mr
captain
and
i
am
not
to
blame
mine
is
an
honourable
house
mr
captain
and
honourable
behaviour
mr
captain
and
i
always
always
dislike
any
scandal
myself
but
he
came
quite
tipsy
and
asked
for
three
bottles
again
and
then
he
lifted
up
one
leg
and
began
playing
the
pianoforte
with
one
foot
and
that
is
not
at
all
right
in
an
honourable
house
and
he
ganz
broke
the
piano
and
it
was
very
bad
manners
indeed
and
i
said
so
and
he
took
up
a
bottle
and
began
hitting
everyone
with
it
and
then
i
called
the
porter
and
karl
came
and
he
took
karl
and
hit
him
in
the
eye
and
he
hit
henriette
in
the
eye
too
and
gave
me
five
slaps
on
the
cheek
and
it
was
so
ungentlemanly
in
an
honourable
house
mr
captain
and
i
screamed
and
he
opened
the
window
over
the
canal
and
stood
in
the
window
squealing
like
a
little
pig
it
was
a
disgrace
the
idea
of
squealing
like
a
little
pig
at
the
window
into
the
street
fie
upon
him
and
karl
pulled
him
away
from
the
window
by
his
coat
and
it
is
true
mr
captain
he
tore
sein
rock
and
then
he
shouted
that
man
muss
pay
him
fifteen
roubles
damages
and
i
did
pay
him
mr
captain
five
roubles
for
sein
rock
and
he
is
an
ungentlemanly
visitor
and
caused
all
the
scandal
i
will
show
you
up
he
said
for
i
can
write
to
all
the
papers
about
you
then
he
was
an
author
yes
mr
captain
and
what
an
ungentlemanly
visitor
in
an
honourable
house
now
then
enough
i
have
told
you
already
ilya
petrovitch
the
head
clerk
repeated
significantly
the
assistant
glanced
rapidly
at
him
the
head
clerk
slightly
shook
his
head
so
i
tell
you
this
most
respectable
luise
ivanovna
and
i
tell
it
you
for
the
last
time
the
assistant
went
on
if
there
is
a
scandal
in
your
honourable
house
once
again
i
will
put
you
yourself
in
the
lock
up
as
it
is
called
in
polite
society
do
you
hear
so
a
literary
man
an
author
took
five
roubles
for
his
coat
tail
in
an
honourable
house
a
nice
set
these
authors
and
he
cast
a
contemptuous
glance
at
raskolnikov
there
was
a
scandal
the
other
day
in
a
restaurant
too
an
author
had
eaten
his
dinner
and
would
not
pay
i
ll
write
a
satire
on
you
says
he
and
there
was
another
of
them
on
a
steamer
last
week
used
the
most
disgraceful
language
to
the
respectable
family
of
a
civil
councillor
his
wife
and
daughter
and
there
was
one
of
them
turned
out
of
a
confectioner
s
shop
the
other
day
they
are
like
that
authors
literary
men
students
town
criers
pfoo
you
get
along
i
shall
look
in
upon
you
myself
one
day
then
you
had
better
be
careful
do
you
hear
with
hurried
deference
luise
ivanovna
fell
to
curtsying
in
all
directions
and
so
curtsied
herself
to
the
door
but
at
the
door
she
stumbled
backwards
against
a
good
looking
officer
with
a
fresh
open
face
and
splendid
thick
fair
whiskers
this
was
the
superintendent
of
the
district
himself
nikodim
fomitch
luise
ivanovna
made
haste
to
curtsy
almost
to
the
ground
and
with
mincing
little
steps
she
fluttered
out
of
the
office
again
thunder
and
lightning
a
hurricane
said
nikodim
fomitch
to
ilya
petrovitch
in
a
civil
and
friendly
tone
you
are
aroused
again
you
are
fuming
again
i
heard
it
on
the
stairs
well
what
then
ilya
petrovitch
drawled
with
gentlemanly
nonchalance
and
he
walked
with
some
papers
to
another
table
with
a
jaunty
swing
of
his
shoulders
at
each
step
here
if
you
will
kindly
look
an
author
or
a
student
has
been
one
at
least
does
not
pay
his
debts
has
given
an
i
o
u
won
t
clear
out
of
his
room
and
complaints
are
constantly
being
lodged
against
him
and
here
he
has
been
pleased
to
make
a
protest
against
my
smoking
in
his
presence
he
behaves
like
a
cad
himself
and
just
look
at
him
please
here
s
the
gentleman
and
very
attractive
he
is
poverty
is
not
a
vice
my
friend
but
we
know
you
go
off
like
powder
you
can
t
bear
a
slight
i
daresay
you
took
offence
at
something
and
went
too
far
yourself
continued
nikodim
fomitch
turning
affably
to
raskolnikov
but
you
were
wrong
there
he
is
a
capital
fellow
i
assure
you
but
explosive
explosive
he
gets
hot
fires
up
boils
over
and
no
stopping
him
and
then
it
s
all
over
and
at
the
bottom
he
s
a
heart
of
gold
his
nickname
in
the
regiment
was
the
explosive
lieutenant
and
what
a
regiment
it
was
too
cried
ilya
petrovitch
much
gratified
at
this
agreeable
banter
though
still
sulky
raskolnikov
had
a
sudden
desire
to
say
something
exceptionally
pleasant
to
them
all
excuse
me
captain
he
began
easily
suddenly
addressing
nikodim
fomitch
will
you
enter
into
my
position
i
am
ready
to
ask
pardon
if
i
have
been
ill
mannered
i
am
a
poor
student
sick
and
shattered
shattered
was
the
word
he
used
by
poverty
i
am
not
studying
because
i
cannot
keep
myself
now
but
i
shall
get
money
i
have
a
mother
and
sister
in
the
province
of
x
they
will
send
it
to
me
and
i
will
pay
my
landlady
is
a
good
hearted
woman
but
she
is
so
exasperated
at
my
having
lost
my
lessons
and
not
paying
her
for
the
last
four
months
that
she
does
not
even
send
up
my
dinner
and
i
don
t
understand
this
i
o
u
at
all
she
is
asking
me
to
pay
her
on
this
i
o
u
how
am
i
to
pay
her
judge
for
yourselves
but
that
is
not
our
business
you
know
the
head
clerk
was
observing
yes
yes
i
perfectly
agree
with
you
but
allow
me
to
explain
raskolnikov
put
in
again
still
addressing
nikodim
fomitch
but
trying
his
best
to
address
ilya
petrovitch
also
though
the
latter
persistently
appeared
to
be
rummaging
among
his
papers
and
to
be
contemptuously
oblivious
of
him
allow
me
to
explain
that
i
have
been
living
with
her
for
nearly
three
years
and
at
first
at
first
for
why
should
i
not
confess
it
at
the
very
beginning
i
promised
to
marry
her
daughter
it
was
a
verbal
promise
freely
given
she
was
a
girl
indeed
i
liked
her
though
i
was
not
in
love
with
her
a
youthful
affair
in
fact
that
is
i
mean
to
say
that
my
landlady
gave
me
credit
freely
in
those
days
and
i
led
a
life
of
i
was
very
heedless
nobody
asks
you
for
these
personal
details
sir
we
ve
no
time
to
waste
ilya
petrovitch
interposed
roughly
and
with
a
note
of
triumph
but
raskolnikov
stopped
him
hotly
though
he
suddenly
found
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
speak
but
excuse
me
excuse
me
it
is
for
me
to
explain
how
it
all
happened
in
my
turn
though
i
agree
with
you
it
is
unnecessary
but
a
year
ago
the
girl
died
of
typhus
i
remained
lodging
there
as
before
and
when
my
landlady
moved
into
her
present
quarters
she
said
to
me
and
in
a
friendly
way
that
she
had
complete
trust
in
me
but
still
would
i
not
give
her
an
i
o
u
for
one
hundred
and
fifteen
roubles
all
the
debt
i
owed
her
she
said
if
only
i
gave
her
that
she
would
trust
me
again
as
much
as
i
liked
and
that
she
would
never
never
those
were
her
own
words
make
use
of
that
i
o
u
till
i
could
pay
of
myself
and
now
when
i
have
lost
my
lessons
and
have
nothing
to
eat
she
takes
action
against
me
what
am
i
to
say
to
that
all
these
affecting
details
are
no
business
of
ours
ilya
petrovitch
interrupted
rudely
you
must
give
a
written
undertaking
but
as
for
your
love
affairs
and
all
these
tragic
events
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
come
now
you
are
harsh
muttered
nikodim
fomitch
sitting
down
at
the
table
and
also
beginning
to
write
he
looked
a
little
ashamed
write
said
the
head
clerk
to
raskolnikov
write
what
the
latter
asked
gruffly
i
will
dictate
to
you
raskolnikov
fancied
that
the
head
clerk
treated
him
more
casually
and
contemptuously
after
his
speech
but
strange
to
say
he
suddenly
felt
completely
indifferent
to
anyone
s
opinion
and
this
revulsion
took
place
in
a
flash
in
one
instant
if
he
had
cared
to
think
a
little
he
would
have
been
amazed
indeed
that
he
could
have
talked
to
them
like
that
a
minute
before
forcing
his
feelings
upon
them
and
where
had
those
feelings
come
from
now
if
the
whole
room
had
been
filled
not
with
police
officers
but
with
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
he
would
not
have
found
one
human
word
for
them
so
empty
was
his
heart
a
gloomy
sensation
of
agonising
everlasting
solitude
and
remoteness
took
conscious
form
in
his
soul
it
was
not
the
meanness
of
his
sentimental
effusions
before
ilya
petrovitch
nor
the
meanness
of
the
latter
s
triumph
over
him
that
had
caused
this
sudden
revulsion
in
his
heart
oh
what
had
he
to
do
now
with
his
own
baseness
with
all
these
petty
vanities
officers
german
women
debts
police
offices
if
he
had
been
sentenced
to
be
burnt
at
that
moment
he
would
not
have
stirred
would
hardly
have
heard
the
sentence
to
the
end
something
was
happening
to
him
entirely
new
sudden
and
unknown
it
was
not
that
he
understood
but
he
felt
clearly
with
all
the
intensity
of
sensation
that
he
could
never
more
appeal
to
these
people
in
the
police
office
with
sentimental
effusions
like
his
recent
outburst
or
with
anything
whatever
and
that
if
they
had
been
his
own
brothers
and
sisters
and
not
police
officers
it
would
have
been
utterly
out
of
the
question
to
appeal
to
them
in
any
circumstance
of
life
he
had
never
experienced
such
a
strange
and
awful
sensation
and
what
was
most
agonising
it
was
more
a
sensation
than
a
conception
or
idea
a
direct
sensation
the
most
agonising
of
all
the
sensations
he
had
known
in
his
life
the
head
clerk
began
dictating
to
him
the
usual
form
of
declaration
that
he
could
not
pay
that
he
undertook
to
do
so
at
a
future
date
that
he
would
not
leave
the
town
nor
sell
his
property
and
so
on
but
you
can
t
write
you
can
hardly
hold
the
pen
observed
the
head
clerk
looking
with
curiosity
at
raskolnikov
are
you
ill
yes
i
am
giddy
go
on
that
s
all
sign
it
the
head
clerk
took
the
paper
and
turned
to
attend
to
others
raskolnikov
gave
back
the
pen
but
instead
of
getting
up
and
going
away
he
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
pressed
his
head
in
his
hands
he
felt
as
if
a
nail
were
being
driven
into
his
skull
a
strange
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
get
up
at
once
to
go
up
to
nikodim
fomitch
and
tell
him
everything
that
had
happened
yesterday
and
then
to
go
with
him
to
his
lodgings
and
to
show
him
the
things
in
the
hole
in
the
corner
the
impulse
was
so
strong
that
he
got
up
from
his
seat
to
carry
it
out
hadn
t
i
better
think
a
minute
flashed
through
his
mind
no
better
cast
off
the
burden
without
thinking
but
all
at
once
he
stood
still
rooted
to
the
spot
nikodim
fomitch
was
talking
eagerly
with
ilya
petrovitch
and
the
words
reached
him
it
s
impossible
they
ll
both
be
released
to
begin
with
the
whole
story
contradicts
itself
why
should
they
have
called
the
porter
if
it
had
been
their
doing
to
inform
against
themselves
or
as
a
blind
no
that
would
be
too
cunning
besides
pestryakov
the
student
was
seen
at
the
gate
by
both
the
porters
and
a
woman
as
he
went
in
he
was
walking
with
three
friends
who
left
him
only
at
the
gate
and
he
asked
the
porters
to
direct
him
in
the
presence
of
the
friends
now
would
he
have
asked
his
way
if
he
had
been
going
with
such
an
object
as
for
koch
he
spent
half
an
hour
at
the
silversmith
s
below
before
he
went
up
to
the
old
woman
and
he
left
him
at
exactly
a
quarter
to
eight
now
just
consider
but
excuse
me
how
do
you
explain
this
contradiction
they
state
themselves
that
they
knocked
and
the
door
was
locked
yet
three
minutes
later
when
they
went
up
with
the
porter
it
turned
out
the
door
was
unfastened
that
s
just
it
the
murderer
must
have
been
there
and
bolted
himself
in
and
they
d
have
caught
him
for
a
certainty
if
koch
had
not
been
an
ass
and
gone
to
look
for
the
porter
too
he
must
have
seized
the
interval
to
get
downstairs
and
slip
by
them
somehow
koch
keeps
crossing
himself
and
saying
if
i
had
been
there
he
would
have
jumped
out
and
killed
me
with
his
axe
he
is
going
to
have
a
thanksgiving
service
ha
ha
and
no
one
saw
the
murderer
they
might
well
not
see
him
the
house
is
a
regular
noah
s
ark
said
the
head
clerk
who
was
listening
it
s
clear
quite
clear
nikodim
fomitch
repeated
warmly
no
it
is
anything
but
clear
ilya
petrovitch
maintained
raskolnikov
picked
up
his
hat
and
walked
towards
the
door
but
he
did
not
reach
it
when
he
recovered
consciousness
he
found
himself
sitting
in
a
chair
supported
by
someone
on
the
right
side
while
someone
else
was
standing
on
the
left
holding
a
yellowish
glass
filled
with
yellow
water
and
nikodim
fomitch
standing
before
him
looking
intently
at
him
he
got
up
from
the
chair
what
s
this
are
you
ill
nikodim
fomitch
asked
rather
sharply
he
could
hardly
hold
his
pen
when
he
was
signing
said
the
head
clerk
settling
back
in
his
place
and
taking
up
his
work
again
have
you
been
ill
long
cried
ilya
petrovitch
from
his
place
where
he
too
was
looking
through
papers
he
had
of
course
come
to
look
at
the
sick
man
when
he
fainted
but
retired
at
once
when
he
recovered
since
yesterday
muttered
raskolnikov
in
reply
did
you
go
out
yesterday
yes
though
you
were
ill
yes
at
what
time
about
seven
and
where
did
you
go
my
i
ask
along
the
street
short
and
clear
raskolnikov
white
as
a
handkerchief
had
answered
sharply
jerkily
without
dropping
his
black
feverish
eyes
before
ilya
petrovitch
s
stare
he
can
scarcely
stand
upright
and
you
nikodim
fomitch
was
beginning
no
matter
ilya
petrovitch
pronounced
rather
peculiarly
nikodim
fomitch
would
have
made
some
further
protest
but
glancing
at
the
head
clerk
who
was
looking
very
hard
at
him
he
did
not
speak
there
was
a
sudden
silence
it
was
strange
very
well
then
concluded
ilya
petrovitch
we
will
not
detain
you
raskolnikov
went
out
he
caught
the
sound
of
eager
conversation
on
his
departure
and
above
the
rest
rose
the
questioning
voice
of
nikodim
fomitch
in
the
street
his
faintness
passed
off
completely
a
search
there
will
be
a
search
at
once
he
repeated
to
himself
hurrying
home
the
brutes
they
suspect
his
former
terror
mastered
him
completely
again
chapter
ii
and
what
if
there
has
been
a
search
already
what
if
i
find
them
in
my
room
but
here
was
his
room
nothing
and
no
one
in
it
no
one
had
peeped
in
even
nastasya
had
not
touched
it
but
heavens
how
could
he
have
left
all
those
things
in
the
hole
he
rushed
to
the
corner
slipped
his
hand
under
the
paper
pulled
the
things
out
and
lined
his
pockets
with
them
there
were
eight
articles
in
all
two
little
boxes
with
ear
rings
or
something
of
the
sort
he
hardly
looked
to
see
then
four
small
leather
cases
there
was
a
chain
too
merely
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
something
else
in
newspaper
that
looked
like
a
decoration
he
put
them
all
in
the
different
pockets
of
his
overcoat
and
the
remaining
pocket
of
his
trousers
trying
to
conceal
them
as
much
as
possible
he
took
the
purse
too
then
he
went
out
of
his
room
leaving
the
door
open
he
walked
quickly
and
resolutely
and
though
he
felt
shattered
he
had
his
senses
about
him
he
was
afraid
of
pursuit
he
was
afraid
that
in
another
half
hour
another
quarter
of
an
hour
perhaps
instructions
would
be
issued
for
his
pursuit
and
so
at
all
costs
he
must
hide
all
traces
before
then
he
must
clear
everything
up
while
he
still
had
some
strength
some
reasoning
power
left
him
where
was
he
to
go
that
had
long
been
settled
fling
them
into
the
canal
and
all
traces
hidden
in
the
water
the
thing
would
be
at
an
end
so
he
had
decided
in
the
night
of
his
delirium
when
several
times
he
had
had
the
impulse
to
get
up
and
go
away
to
make
haste
and
get
rid
of
it
all
but
to
get
rid
of
it
turned
out
to
be
a
very
difficult
task
he
wandered
along
the
bank
of
the
ekaterininsky
canal
for
half
an
hour
or
more
and
looked
several
times
at
the
steps
running
down
to
the
water
but
he
could
not
think
of
carrying
out
his
plan
either
rafts
stood
at
the
steps
edge
and
women
were
washing
clothes
on
them
or
boats
were
moored
there
and
people
were
swarming
everywhere
moreover
he
could
be
seen
and
noticed
from
the
banks
on
all
sides
it
would
look
suspicious
for
a
man
to
go
down
on
purpose
stop
and
throw
something
into
the
water
and
what
if
the
boxes
were
to
float
instead
of
sinking
and
of
course
they
would
even
as
it
was
everyone
he
met
seemed
to
stare
and
look
round
as
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
watch
him
why
is
it
or
can
it
be
my
fancy
he
thought
at
last
the
thought
struck
him
that
it
might
be
better
to
go
to
the
neva
there
were
not
so
many
people
there
he
would
be
less
observed
and
it
would
be
more
convenient
in
every
way
above
all
it
was
further
off
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
wandering
for
a
good
half
hour
worried
and
anxious
in
this
dangerous
past
without
thinking
of
it
before
and
that
half
hour
he
had
lost
over
an
irrational
plan
simply
because
he
had
thought
of
it
in
delirium
he
had
become
extremely
absent
and
forgetful
and
he
was
aware
of
it
he
certainly
must
make
haste
he
walked
towards
the
neva
along
v
prospect
but
on
the
way
another
idea
struck
him
why
to
the
neva
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
somewhere
far
off
to
the
islands
again
and
there
hide
the
things
in
some
solitary
place
in
a
wood
or
under
a
bush
and
mark
the
spot
perhaps
and
though
he
felt
incapable
of
clear
judgment
the
idea
seemed
to
him
a
sound
one
but
he
was
not
destined
to
go
there
for
coming
out
of
v
prospect
towards
the
square
he
saw
on
the
left
a
passage
leading
between
two
blank
walls
to
a
courtyard
on
the
right
hand
the
blank
unwhitewashed
wall
of
a
four
storied
house
stretched
far
into
the
court
on
the
left
a
wooden
hoarding
ran
parallel
with
it
for
twenty
paces
into
the
court
and
then
turned
sharply
to
the
left
here
was
a
deserted
fenced
off
place
where
rubbish
of
different
sorts
was
lying
at
the
end
of
the
court
the
corner
of
a
low
smutty
stone
shed
apparently
part
of
some
workshop
peeped
from
behind
the
hoarding
it
was
probably
a
carriage
builder
s
or
carpenter
s
shed
the
whole
place
from
the
entrance
was
black
with
coal
dust
here
would
be
the
place
to
throw
it
he
thought
not
seeing
anyone
in
the
yard
he
slipped
in
and
at
once
saw
near
the
gate
a
sink
such
as
is
often
put
in
yards
where
there
are
many
workmen
or
cab
drivers
and
on
the
hoarding
above
had
been
scribbled
in
chalk
the
time
honoured
witticism
standing
here
strictly
forbidden
this
was
all
the
better
for
there
would
be
nothing
suspicious
about
his
going
in
here
i
could
throw
it
all
in
a
heap
and
get
away
looking
round
once
more
with
his
hand
already
in
his
pocket
he
noticed
against
the
outer
wall
between
the
entrance
and
the
sink
a
big
unhewn
stone
weighing
perhaps
sixty
pounds
the
other
side
of
the
wall
was
a
street
he
could
hear
passers
by
always
numerous
in
that
part
but
he
could
not
be
seen
from
the
entrance
unless
someone
came
in
from
the
street
which
might
well
happen
indeed
so
there
was
need
of
haste
he
bent
down
over
the
stone
seized
the
top
of
it
firmly
in
both
hands
and
using
all
his
strength
turned
it
over
under
the
stone
was
a
small
hollow
in
the
ground
and
he
immediately
emptied
his
pocket
into
it
the
purse
lay
at
the
top
and
yet
the
hollow
was
not
filled
up
then
he
seized
the
stone
again
and
with
one
twist
turned
it
back
so
that
it
was
in
the
same
position
again
though
it
stood
a
very
little
higher
but
he
scraped
the
earth
about
it
and
pressed
it
at
the
edges
with
his
foot
nothing
could
be
noticed
then
he
went
out
and
turned
into
the
square
again
an
intense
almost
unbearable
joy
overwhelmed
him
for
an
instant
as
it
had
in
the
police
office
i
have
buried
my
tracks
and
who
who
can
think
of
looking
under
that
stone
it
has
been
lying
there
most
likely
ever
since
the
house
was
built
and
will
lie
as
many
years
more
and
if
it
were
found
who
would
think
of
me
it
is
all
over
no
clue
and
he
laughed
yes
he
remembered
that
he
began
laughing
a
thin
nervous
noiseless
laugh
and
went
on
laughing
all
the
time
he
was
crossing
the
square
but
when
he
reached
the
k
boulevard
where
two
days
before
he
had
come
upon
that
girl
his
laughter
suddenly
ceased
other
ideas
crept
into
his
mind
he
felt
all
at
once
that
it
would
be
loathsome
to
pass
that
seat
on
which
after
the
girl
was
gone
he
had
sat
and
pondered
and
that
it
would
be
hateful
too
to
meet
that
whiskered
policeman
to
whom
he
had
given
the
twenty
copecks
damn
him
he
walked
looking
about
him
angrily
and
distractedly
all
his
ideas
now
seemed
to
be
circling
round
some
single
point
and
he
felt
that
there
really
was
such
a
point
and
that
now
now
he
was
left
facing
that
point
and
for
the
first
time
indeed
during
the
last
two
months
damn
it
all
he
thought
suddenly
in
a
fit
of
ungovernable
fury
if
it
has
begun
then
it
has
begun
hang
the
new
life
good
lord
how
stupid
it
is
and
what
lies
i
told
to
day
how
despicably
i
fawned
upon
that
wretched
ilya
petrovitch
but
that
is
all
folly
what
do
i
care
for
them
all
and
my
fawning
upon
them
it
is
not
that
at
all
it
is
not
that
at
all
suddenly
he
stopped
a
new
utterly
unexpected
and
exceedingly
simple
question
perplexed
and
bitterly
confounded
him
if
it
all
has
really
been
done
deliberately
and
not
idiotically
if
i
really
had
a
certain
and
definite
object
how
is
it
i
did
not
even
glance
into
the
purse
and
don
t
know
what
i
had
there
for
which
i
have
undergone
these
agonies
and
have
deliberately
undertaken
this
base
filthy
degrading
business
and
here
i
wanted
at
once
to
throw
into
the
water
the
purse
together
with
all
the
things
which
i
had
not
seen
either
how
s
that
yes
that
was
so
that
was
all
so
yet
he
had
known
it
all
before
and
it
was
not
a
new
question
for
him
even
when
it
was
decided
in
the
night
without
hesitation
and
consideration
as
though
so
it
must
be
as
though
it
could
not
possibly
be
otherwise
yes
he
had
known
it
all
and
understood
it
all
it
surely
had
all
been
settled
even
yesterday
at
the
moment
when
he
was
bending
over
the
box
and
pulling
the
jewel
cases
out
of
it
yes
so
it
was
it
is
because
i
am
very
ill
he
decided
grimly
at
last
i
have
been
worrying
and
fretting
myself
and
i
don
t
know
what
i
am
doing
yesterday
and
the
day
before
yesterday
and
all
this
time
i
have
been
worrying
myself
i
shall
get
well
and
i
shall
not
worry
but
what
if
i
don
t
get
well
at
all
good
god
how
sick
i
am
of
it
all
he
walked
on
without
resting
he
had
a
terrible
longing
for
some
distraction
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
what
to
attempt
a
new
overwhelming
sensation
was
gaining
more
and
more
mastery
over
him
every
moment
this
was
an
immeasurable
almost
physical
repulsion
for
everything
surrounding
him
an
obstinate
malignant
feeling
of
hatred
all
who
met
him
were
loathsome
to
him
he
loathed
their
faces
their
movements
their
gestures
if
anyone
had
addressed
him
he
felt
that
he
might
have
spat
at
him
or
bitten
him
he
stopped
suddenly
on
coming
out
on
the
bank
of
the
little
neva
near
the
bridge
to
vassilyevsky
ostrov
why
he
lives
here
in
that
house
he
thought
why
i
have
not
come
to
razumihin
of
my
own
accord
here
it
s
the
same
thing
over
again
very
interesting
to
know
though
have
i
come
on
purpose
or
have
i
simply
walked
here
by
chance
never
mind
i
said
the
day
before
yesterday
that
i
would
go
and
see
him
the
day
after
well
and
so
i
will
besides
i
really
cannot
go
further
now
he
went
up
to
razumihin
s
room
on
the
fifth
floor
the
latter
was
at
home
in
his
garret
busily
writing
at
the
moment
and
he
opened
the
door
himself
it
was
four
months
since
they
had
seen
each
other
razumihin
was
sitting
in
a
ragged
dressing
gown
with
slippers
on
his
bare
feet
unkempt
unshaven
and
unwashed
his
face
showed
surprise
is
it
you
he
cried
he
looked
his
comrade
up
and
down
then
after
a
brief
pause
he
whistled
as
hard
up
as
all
that
why
brother
you
ve
cut
me
out
he
added
looking
at
raskolnikov
s
rags
come
sit
down
you
are
tired
i
ll
be
bound
and
when
he
had
sunk
down
on
the
american
leather
sofa
which
was
in
even
worse
condition
than
his
own
razumihin
saw
at
once
that
his
visitor
was
ill
why
you
are
seriously
ill
do
you
know
that
he
began
feeling
his
pulse
raskolnikov
pulled
away
his
hand
never
mind
he
said
i
have
come
for
this
i
have
no
lessons
i
wanted
but
i
don
t
really
want
lessons
but
i
say
you
are
delirious
you
know
razumihin
observed
watching
him
carefully
no
i
am
not
raskolnikov
got
up
from
the
sofa
as
he
had
mounted
the
stairs
to
razumihin
s
he
had
not
realised
that
he
would
be
meeting
his
friend
face
to
face
now
in
a
flash
he
knew
that
what
he
was
least
of
all
disposed
for
at
that
moment
was
to
be
face
to
face
with
anyone
in
the
wide
world
his
spleen
rose
within
him
he
almost
choked
with
rage
at
himself
as
soon
as
he
crossed
razumihin
s
threshold
good
bye
he
said
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
door
stop
stop
you
queer
fish
i
don
t
want
to
said
the
other
again
pulling
away
his
hand
then
why
the
devil
have
you
come
are
you
mad
or
what
why
this
is
almost
insulting
i
won
t
let
you
go
like
that
well
then
i
came
to
you
because
i
know
no
one
but
you
who
could
help
to
begin
because
you
are
kinder
than
anyone
cleverer
i
mean
and
can
judge
and
now
i
see
that
i
want
nothing
do
you
hear
nothing
at
all
no
one
s
services
no
one
s
sympathy
i
am
by
myself
alone
come
that
s
enough
leave
me
alone
stay
a
minute
you
sweep
you
are
a
perfect
madman
as
you
like
for
all
i
care
i
have
no
lessons
do
you
see
and
i
don
t
care
about
that
but
there
s
a
bookseller
heruvimov
and
he
takes
the
place
of
a
lesson
i
would
not
exchange
him
for
five
lessons
he
s
doing
publishing
of
a
kind
and
issuing
natural
science
manuals
and
what
a
circulation
they
have
the
very
titles
are
worth
the
money
you
always
maintained
that
i
was
a
fool
but
by
jove
my
boy
there
are
greater
fools
than
i
am
now
he
is
setting
up
for
being
advanced
not
that
he
has
an
inkling
of
anything
but
of
course
i
encourage
him
here
are
two
signatures
of
the
german
text
in
my
opinion
the
crudest
charlatanism
it
discusses
the
question
is
woman
a
human
being
and
of
course
triumphantly
proves
that
she
is
heruvimov
is
going
to
bring
out
this
work
as
a
contribution
to
the
woman
question
i
am
translating
it
he
will
expand
these
two
and
a
half
signatures
into
six
we
shall
make
up
a
gorgeous
title
half
a
page
long
and
bring
it
out
at
half
a
rouble
it
will
do
he
pays
me
six
roubles
the
signature
it
works
out
to
about
fifteen
roubles
for
the
job
and
i
ve
had
six
already
in
advance
when
we
have
finished
this
we
are
going
to
begin
a
translation
about
whales
and
then
some
of
the
dullest
scandals
out
of
the
second
part
of
les
confessions
we
have
marked
for
translation
somebody
has
told
heruvimov
that
rousseau
was
a
kind
of
radishchev
you
may
be
sure
i
don
t
contradict
him
hang
him
well
would
you
like
to
do
the
second
signature
of
is
woman
a
human
being
if
you
would
take
the
german
and
pens
and
paper
all
those
are
provided
and
take
three
roubles
for
as
i
have
had
six
roubles
in
advance
on
the
whole
thing
three
roubles
come
to
you
for
your
share
and
when
you
have
finished
the
signature
there
will
be
another
three
roubles
for
you
and
please
don
t
think
i
am
doing
you
a
service
quite
the
contrary
as
soon
as
you
came
in
i
saw
how
you
could
help
me
to
begin
with
i
am
weak
in
spelling
and
secondly
i
am
sometimes
utterly
adrift
in
german
so
that
i
make
it
up
as
i
go
along
for
the
most
part
the
only
comfort
is
that
it
s
bound
to
be
a
change
for
the
better
though
who
can
tell
maybe
it
s
sometimes
for
the
worse
will
you
take
it
raskolnikov
took
the
german
sheets
in
silence
took
the
three
roubles
and
without
a
word
went
out
razumihin
gazed
after
him
in
astonishment
but
when
raskolnikov
was
in
the
next
street
he
turned
back
mounted
the
stairs
to
razumihin
s
again
and
laying
on
the
table
the
german
article
and
the
three
roubles
went
out
again
still
without
uttering
a
word
are
you
raving
or
what
razumihin
shouted
roused
to
fury
at
last
what
farce
is
this
you
ll
drive
me
crazy
too
what
did
you
come
to
see
me
for
damn
you
i
don
t
want
translation
muttered
raskolnikov
from
the
stairs
then
what
the
devil
do
you
want
shouted
razumihin
from
above
raskolnikov
continued
descending
the
staircase
in
silence
hey
there
where
are
you
living
no
answer
well
confound
you
then
but
raskolnikov
was
already
stepping
into
the
street
on
the
nikolaevsky
bridge
he
was
roused
to
full
consciousness
again
by
an
unpleasant
incident
a
coachman
after
shouting
at
him
two
or
three
times
gave
him
a
violent
lash
on
the
back
with
his
whip
for
having
almost
fallen
under
his
horses
hoofs
the
lash
so
infuriated
him
that
he
dashed
away
to
the
railing
for
some
unknown
reason
he
had
been
walking
in
the
very
middle
of
the
bridge
in
the
traffic
he
angrily
clenched
and
ground
his
teeth
he
heard
laughter
of
course
serves
him
right
a
pickpocket
i
dare
say
pretending
to
be
drunk
for
sure
and
getting
under
the
wheels
on
purpose
and
you
have
to
answer
for
him
it
s
a
regular
profession
that
s
what
it
is
but
while
he
stood
at
the
railing
still
looking
angry
and
bewildered
after
the
retreating
carriage
and
rubbing
his
back
he
suddenly
felt
someone
thrust
money
into
his
hand
he
looked
it
was
an
elderly
woman
in
a
kerchief
and
goatskin
shoes
with
a
girl
probably
her
daughter
wearing
a
hat
and
carrying
a
green
parasol
take
it
my
good
man
in
christ
s
name
he
took
it
and
they
passed
on
it
was
a
piece
of
twenty
copecks
from
his
dress
and
appearance
they
might
well
have
taken
him
for
a
beggar
asking
alms
in
the
streets
and
the
gift
of
the
twenty
copecks
he
doubtless
owed
to
the
blow
which
made
them
feel
sorry
for
him
he
closed
his
hand
on
the
twenty
copecks
walked
on
for
ten
paces
and
turned
facing
the
neva
looking
towards
the
palace
the
sky
was
without
a
cloud
and
the
water
was
almost
bright
blue
which
is
so
rare
in
the
neva
the
cupola
of
the
cathedral
which
is
seen
at
its
best
from
the
bridge
about
twenty
paces
from
the
chapel
glittered
in
the
sunlight
and
in
the
pure
air
every
ornament
on
it
could
be
clearly
distinguished
the
pain
from
the
lash
went
off
and
raskolnikov
forgot
about
it
one
uneasy
and
not
quite
definite
idea
occupied
him
now
completely
he
stood
still
and
gazed
long
and
intently
into
the
distance
this
spot
was
especially
familiar
to
him
when
he
was
attending
the
university
he
had
hundreds
of
times
generally
on
his
way
home
stood
still
on
this
spot
gazed
at
this
truly
magnificent
spectacle
and
almost
always
marvelled
at
a
vague
and
mysterious
emotion
it
roused
in
him
it
left
him
strangely
cold
this
gorgeous
picture
was
for
him
blank
and
lifeless
he
wondered
every
time
at
his
sombre
and
enigmatic
impression
and
mistrusting
himself
put
off
finding
the
explanation
of
it
he
vividly
recalled
those
old
doubts
and
perplexities
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
no
mere
chance
that
he
recalled
them
now
it
struck
him
as
strange
and
grotesque
that
he
should
have
stopped
at
the
same
spot
as
before
as
though
he
actually
imagined
he
could
think
the
same
thoughts
be
interested
in
the
same
theories
and
pictures
that
had
interested
him
so
short
a
time
ago
he
felt
it
almost
amusing
and
yet
it
wrung
his
heart
deep
down
hidden
far
away
out
of
sight
all
that
seemed
to
him
now
all
his
old
past
his
old
thoughts
his
old
problems
and
theories
his
old
impressions
and
that
picture
and
himself
and
all
all
he
felt
as
though
he
were
flying
upwards
and
everything
were
vanishing
from
his
sight
making
an
unconscious
movement
with
his
hand
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
piece
of
money
in
his
fist
he
opened
his
hand
stared
at
the
coin
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
flung
it
into
the
water
then
he
turned
and
went
home
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
cut
himself
off
from
everyone
and
from
everything
at
that
moment
evening
was
coming
on
when
he
reached
home
so
that
he
must
have
been
walking
about
six
hours
how
and
where
he
came
back
he
did
not
remember
undressing
and
quivering
like
an
overdriven
horse
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
drew
his
greatcoat
over
him
and
at
once
sank
into
oblivion
it
was
dusk
when
he
was
waked
up
by
a
fearful
scream
good
god
what
a
scream
such
unnatural
sounds
such
howling
wailing
grinding
tears
blows
and
curses
he
had
never
heard
he
could
never
have
imagined
such
brutality
such
frenzy
in
terror
he
sat
up
in
bed
almost
swooning
with
agony
but
the
fighting
wailing
and
cursing
grew
louder
and
louder
and
then
to
his
intense
amazement
he
caught
the
voice
of
his
landlady
she
was
howling
shrieking
and
wailing
rapidly
hurriedly
incoherently
so
that
he
could
not
make
out
what
she
was
talking
about
she
was
beseeching
no
doubt
not
to
be
beaten
for
she
was
being
mercilessly
beaten
on
the
stairs
the
voice
of
her
assailant
was
so
horrible
from
spite
and
rage
that
it
was
almost
a
croak
but
he
too
was
saying
something
and
just
as
quickly
and
indistinctly
hurrying
and
spluttering
all
at
once
raskolnikov
trembled
he
recognised
the
voice
it
was
the
voice
of
ilya
petrovitch
ilya
petrovitch
here
and
beating
the
landlady
he
is
kicking
her
banging
her
head
against
the
steps
that
s
clear
that
can
be
told
from
the
sounds
from
the
cries
and
the
thuds
how
is
it
is
the
world
topsy
turvy
he
could
hear
people
running
in
crowds
from
all
the
storeys
and
all
the
staircases
he
heard
voices
exclamations
knocking
doors
banging
but
why
why
and
how
could
it
be
he
repeated
thinking
seriously
that
he
had
gone
mad
but
no
he
heard
too
distinctly
and
they
would
come
to
him
then
next
for
no
doubt
it
s
all
about
that
about
yesterday
good
god
he
would
have
fastened
his
door
with
the
latch
but
he
could
not
lift
his
hand
besides
it
would
be
useless
terror
gripped
his
heart
like
ice
tortured
him
and
numbed
him
but
at
last
all
this
uproar
after
continuing
about
ten
minutes
began
gradually
to
subside
the
landlady
was
moaning
and
groaning
ilya
petrovitch
was
still
uttering
threats
and
curses
but
at
last
he
too
seemed
to
be
silent
and
now
he
could
not
be
heard
can
he
have
gone
away
good
lord
yes
and
now
the
landlady
is
going
too
still
weeping
and
moaning
and
then
her
door
slammed
now
the
crowd
was
going
from
the
stairs
to
their
rooms
exclaiming
disputing
calling
to
one
another
raising
their
voices
to
a
shout
dropping
them
to
a
whisper
there
must
have
been
numbers
of
them
almost
all
the
inmates
of
the
block
but
good
god
how
could
it
be
and
why
why
had
he
come
here
raskolnikov
sank
worn
out
on
the
sofa
but
could
not
close
his
eyes
he
lay
for
half
an
hour
in
such
anguish
such
an
intolerable
sensation
of
infinite
terror
as
he
had
never
experienced
before
suddenly
a
bright
light
flashed
into
his
room
nastasya
came
in
with
a
candle
and
a
plate
of
soup
looking
at
him
carefully
and
ascertaining
that
he
was
not
asleep
she
set
the
candle
on
the
table
and
began
to
lay
out
what
she
had
brought
bread
salt
a
plate
a
spoon
you
ve
eaten
nothing
since
yesterday
i
warrant
you
ve
been
trudging
about
all
day
and
you
re
shaking
with
fever
nastasya
what
were
they
beating
the
landlady
for
she
looked
intently
at
him
who
beat
the
landlady
just
now
half
an
hour
ago
ilya
petrovitch
the
assistant
superintendent
on
the
stairs
why
was
he
ill
treating
her
like
that
and
why
was
he
here
nastasya
scrutinised
him
silent
and
frowning
and
her
scrutiny
lasted
a
long
time
he
felt
uneasy
even
frightened
at
her
searching
eyes
nastasya
why
don
t
you
speak
he
said
timidly
at
last
in
a
weak
voice
it
s
the
blood
she
answered
at
last
softly
as
though
speaking
to
herself
blood
what
blood
he
muttered
growing
white
and
turning
towards
the
wall
nastasya
still
looked
at
him
without
speaking
nobody
has
been
beating
the
landlady
she
declared
at
last
in
a
firm
resolute
voice
he
gazed
at
her
hardly
able
to
breathe
i
heard
it
myself
i
was
not
asleep
i
was
sitting
up
he
said
still
more
timidly
i
listened
a
long
while
the
assistant
superintendent
came
everyone
ran
out
on
to
the
stairs
from
all
the
flats
no
one
has
been
here
that
s
the
blood
crying
in
your
ears
when
there
s
no
outlet
for
it
and
it
gets
clotted
you
begin
fancying
things
will
you
eat
something
he
made
no
answer
nastasya
still
stood
over
him
watching
him
give
me
something
to
drink
nastasya
she
went
downstairs
and
returned
with
a
white
earthenware
jug
of
water
he
remembered
only
swallowing
one
sip
of
the
cold
water
and
spilling
some
on
his
neck
then
followed
forgetfulness
chapter
iii
he
was
not
completely
unconscious
however
all
the
time
he
was
ill
he
was
in
a
feverish
state
sometimes
delirious
sometimes
half
conscious
he
remembered
a
great
deal
afterwards
sometimes
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
a
number
of
people
round
him
they
wanted
to
take
him
away
somewhere
there
was
a
great
deal
of
squabbling
and
discussing
about
him
then
he
would
be
alone
in
the
room
they
had
all
gone
away
afraid
of
him
and
only
now
and
then
opened
the
door
a
crack
to
look
at
him
they
threatened
him
plotted
something
together
laughed
and
mocked
at
him
he
remembered
nastasya
often
at
his
bedside
he
distinguished
another
person
too
whom
he
seemed
to
know
very
well
though
he
could
not
remember
who
he
was
and
this
fretted
him
even
made
him
cry
sometimes
he
fancied
he
had
been
lying
there
a
month
at
other
times
it
all
seemed
part
of
the
same
day
but
of
that
of
that
he
had
no
recollection
and
yet
every
minute
he
felt
that
he
had
forgotten
something
he
ought
to
remember
he
worried
and
tormented
himself
trying
to
remember
moaned
flew
into
a
rage
or
sank
into
awful
intolerable
terror
then
he
struggled
to
get
up
would
have
run
away
but
someone
always
prevented
him
by
force
and
he
sank
back
into
impotence
and
forgetfulness
at
last
he
returned
to
complete
consciousness
it
happened
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
on
fine
days
the
sun
shone
into
the
room
at
that
hour
throwing
a
streak
of
light
on
the
right
wall
and
the
corner
near
the
door
nastasya
was
standing
beside
him
with
another
person
a
complete
stranger
who
was
looking
at
him
very
inquisitively
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
beard
wearing
a
full
short
waisted
coat
and
looked
like
a
messenger
the
landlady
was
peeping
in
at
the
half
opened
door
raskolnikov
sat
up
who
is
this
nastasya
he
asked
pointing
to
the
young
man
i
say
he
s
himself
again
she
said
he
is
himself
echoed
the
man
concluding
that
he
had
returned
to
his
senses
the
landlady
closed
the
door
and
disappeared
she
was
always
shy
and
dreaded
conversations
or
discussions
she
was
a
woman
of
forty
not
at
all
bad
looking
fat
and
buxom
with
black
eyes
and
eyebrows
good
natured
from
fatness
and
laziness
and
absurdly
bashful
who
are
you
he
went
on
addressing
the
man
but
at
that
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
stooping
a
little
as
he
was
so
tall
razumihin
came
in
what
a
cabin
it
is
he
cried
i
am
always
knocking
my
head

this
a
lodging

are
conscious

ve
just
heard
the
news
from
pashenka

has
just
come
to
said
nastasya
just
come
to
echoed
the
man
again
with
a
smile
and
who
are
you
razumihin
asked
suddenly
addressing
him
my
name
is
vrazumihin
at
your
service
not
razumihin
as
i
am
always
called
but
vrazumihin
a
student
and
gentleman
and
he
is
my
friend
and
who
are
you
i
am
the
messenger
from
our
office
from
the
merchant
shelopaev
and
i
ve
come
on
business

down
razumihin
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
it
s
a
good
thing
you
ve
come
to
brother
he
went
on
to
raskolnikov
for
the
last
four
days
you
have
scarcely
eaten
or
drunk
anything
we
had
to
give
you
tea
in
spoonfuls
i
brought
zossimov
to
see
you
twice
you
remember
zossimov
he
examined
you
carefully
and
said
at
once
it
was
nothing
serious
something
seemed
to
have
gone
to
your
head
some
nervous
nonsense
the
result
of
bad
feeding
he
says
you
have
not
had
enough
beer
and
radish
but
it
s
nothing
much
it
will
pass
and
you
will
be
all
right
zossimov
is
a
first
rate
fellow
he
is
making
quite
a
name
come
i
won
t
keep
you
he
said
addressing
the
man
again
will
you
explain
what
you
want
you
must
know
rodya
this
is
the
second
time
they
have
sent
from
the
office
but
it
was
another
man
last
time
and
i
talked
to
him
who
was
it
came
before
that
was
the
day
before
yesterday
i
venture
to
say
if
you
please
sir
that
was
alexey
semyonovitch
he
is
in
our
office
too
he
was
more
intelligent
than
you
don
t
you
think
so
yes
indeed
sir
he
is
of
more
weight
than
i
am
quite
so
go
on
at
your
mamma
s
request
through
afanasy
ivanovitch
vahrushin
of
whom
i
presume
you
have
heard
more
than
once
a
remittance
is
sent
to
you
from
our
office
the
man
began
addressing
raskolnikov
if
you
are
in
an
intelligible
condition
i
ve
thirty
five
roubles
to
remit
to
you
as
semyon
semyonovitch
has
received
from
afanasy
ivanovitch
at
your
mamma
s
request
instructions
to
that
effect
as
on
previous
occasions
do
you
know
him
sir
yes
i
remember
vahrushin
raskolnikov
said
dreamily
you
hear
he
knows
vahrushin
cried
razumihin
he
is
in
an
intelligible
condition
and
i
see
you
are
an
intelligent
man
too
well
it
s
always
pleasant
to
hear
words
of
wisdom
that
s
the
gentleman
vahrushin
afanasy
ivanovitch
and
at
the
request
of
your
mamma
who
has
sent
you
a
remittance
once
before
in
the
same
manner
through
him
he
did
not
refuse
this
time
also
and
sent
instructions
to
semyon
semyonovitch
some
days
since
to
hand
you
thirty
five
roubles
in
the
hope
of
better
to
come
that
hoping
for
better
to
come
is
the
best
thing
you
ve
said
though
your
mamma
is
not
bad
either
come
then
what
do
you
say
is
he
fully
conscious
eh
that
s
all
right

only
he
can

this
little
paper
he
can
scrawl
his
name

book

raskolnikov
for
him

just
now
brother

us
than
treacle

don
t
want

said
raskolnikov
pushing
away
the
pen
not
want
it
i
won
t
sign
it
how
the
devil
can
you
do
without
signing
it
i
don
t
want
the
money
don
t
want
the
money
come
brother
that
s
nonsense
i
bear
witness
don
t
trouble
please
it
s
only
that
he
is
on
his
travels
again
but
that
s
pretty
common
with
him
at
all
times
though
you
are
a
man
of
judgment
and
we
will
take
him
in
hand
that
is
more
simply
take
his
hand
and
he
will
sign
it
here
but
i
can
come
another
time
no
no
why
should
we
trouble
you
you
are
a
man
of
judgment
now
rodya
don
t
keep
your
visitor
you
see
he
is
waiting
and
he
made
ready
to
hold
raskolnikov
s
hand
in
earnest
stop
i
ll
do
it
alone
said
the
latter
taking
the
pen
and
signing
his
name
the
messenger
took
out
the
money
and
went
away
bravo
and
now
brother
are
you
hungry
yes
answered
raskolnikov
is
there
any
soup
some
of
yesterday
s
answered
nastasya
who
was
still
standing
there
with
potatoes
and
rice
in
it
yes
i
know
it
by
heart
bring
soup
and
give
us
some
tea
very
well
raskolnikov
looked
at
all
this
with
profound
astonishment
and
a
dull
unreasoning
terror
he
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
quiet
and
see
what
would
happen
i
believe
i
am
not
wandering
i
believe
it
s
reality
he
thought
in
a
couple
of
minutes
nastasya
returned
with
the
soup
and
announced
that
the
tea
would
be
ready
directly
with
the
soup
she
brought
two
spoons
two
plates
salt
pepper
mustard
for
the
beef
and
so
on
the
table
was
set
as
it
had
not
been
for
a
long
time
the
cloth
was
clean
it
would
not
be
amiss
nastasya
if
praskovya
pavlovna
were
to
send
us
up
a
couple
of
bottles
of
beer
we
could
empty
them
well
you
are
a
cool
hand
muttered
nastasya
and
she
departed
to
carry
out
his
orders
raskolnikov
still
gazed
wildly
with
strained
attention
meanwhile
razumihin
sat
down
on
the
sofa
beside
him
as
clumsily
as
a
bear
put
his
left
arm
round
raskolnikov
s
head
although
he
was
able
to
sit
up
and
with
his
right
hand
gave
him
a
spoonful
of
soup
blowing
on
it
that
it
might
not
burn
him
but
the
soup
was
only
just
warm
raskolnikov
swallowed
one
spoonful
greedily
then
a
second
then
a
third
but
after
giving
him
a
few
more
spoonfuls
of
soup
razumihin
suddenly
stopped
and
said
that
he
must
ask
zossimov
whether
he
ought
to
have
more
nastasya
came
in
with
two
bottles
of
beer
and
will
you
have
tea
yes
cut
along
nastasya
and
bring
some
tea
for
tea
we
may
venture
on
without
the
faculty
but
here
is
the
beer
he
moved
back
to
his
chair
pulled
the
soup
and
meat
in
front
of
him
and
began
eating
as
though
he
had
not
touched
food
for
three
days
i
must
tell
you
rodya
i
dine
like
this
here
every
day
now
he
mumbled
with
his
mouth
full
of
beef
and
it
s
all
pashenka
your
dear
little
landlady
who
sees
to
that
she
loves
to
do
anything
for
me
i
don
t
ask
for
it
but
of
course
i
don
t
object
and
here
s
nastasya
with
the
tea
she
is
a
quick
girl
nastasya
my
dear
won
t
you
have
some
beer
get
along
with
your
nonsense
a
cup
of
tea
then
a
cup
of
tea
maybe
pour
it
out
stay
i
ll
pour
it
out
myself
sit
down
he
poured
out
two
cups
left
his
dinner
and
sat
on
the
sofa
again
as
before
he
put
his
left
arm
round
the
sick
man
s
head
raised
him
up
and
gave
him
tea
in
spoonfuls
again
blowing
each
spoonful
steadily
and
earnestly
as
though
this
process
was
the
principal
and
most
effective
means
towards
his
friend
s
recovery
raskolnikov
said
nothing
and
made
no
resistance
though
he
felt
quite
strong
enough
to
sit
up
on
the
sofa
without
support
and
could
not
merely
have
held
a
cup
or
a
spoon
but
even
perhaps
could
have
walked
about
but
from
some
queer
almost
animal
cunning
he
conceived
the
idea
of
hiding
his
strength
and
lying
low
for
a
time
pretending
if
necessary
not
to
be
yet
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties
and
meanwhile
listening
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
yet
he
could
not
overcome
his
sense
of
repugnance
after
sipping
a
dozen
spoonfuls
of
tea
he
suddenly
released
his
head
pushed
the
spoon
away
capriciously
and
sank
back
on
the
pillow
there
were
actually
real
pillows
under
his
head
now
down
pillows
in
clean
cases
he
observed
that
too
and
took
note
of
it
pashenka
must
give
us
some
raspberry
jam
to
day
to
make
him
some
raspberry
tea
said
razumihin
going
back
to
his
chair
and
attacking
his
soup
and
beer
again
and
where
is
she
to
get
raspberries
for
you
asked
nastasya
balancing
a
saucer
on
her
five
outspread
fingers
and
sipping
tea
through
a
lump
of
sugar
she
ll
get
it
at
the
shop
my
dear
you
see
rodya
all
sorts
of
things
have
been
happening
while
you
have
been
laid
up
when
you
decamped
in
that
rascally
way
without
leaving
your
address
i
felt
so
angry
that
i
resolved
to
find
you
out
and
punish
you
i
set
to
work
that
very
day
how
i
ran
about
making
inquiries
for
you
this
lodging
of
yours
i
had
forgotten
though
i
never
remembered
it
indeed
because
i
did
not
know
it
and
as
for
your
old
lodgings
i
could
only
remember
it
was
at
the
five
corners
harlamov
s
house
i
kept
trying
to
find
that
harlamov
s
house
and
afterwards
it
turned
out
that
it
was
not
harlamov
s
but
buch
s
how
one
muddles
up
sound
sometimes
so
i
lost
my
temper
and
i
went
on
the
chance
to
the
address
bureau
next
day
and
only
fancy
in
two
minutes
they
looked
you
up
your
name
is
down
there
my
name
i
should
think
so
and
yet
a
general
kobelev
they
could
not
find
while
i
was
there
well
it
s
a
long
story
but
as
soon
as
i
did
land
on
this
place
i
soon
got
to
know
all
your
affairs
all
all
brother
i
know
everything
nastasya
here
will
tell
you
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
nikodim
fomitch
and
ilya
petrovitch
and
the
house
porter
and
mr
zametov
alexandr
grigorievitch
the
head
clerk
in
the
police
office
and
last
but
not
least
of
pashenka
nastasya
here
knows
he
s
got
round
her
nastasya
murmured
smiling
slyly
why
don
t
you
put
the
sugar
in
your
tea
nastasya
nikiforovna
you
are
a
one
nastasya
cried
suddenly
going
off
into
a
giggle
i
am
not
nikiforovna
but
petrovna
she
added
suddenly
recovering
from
her
mirth
i
ll
make
a
note
of
it
well
brother
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
was
going
in
for
a
regular
explosion
here
to
uproot
all
malignant
influences
in
the
locality
but
pashenka
won
the
day
i
had
not
expected
brother
to
find
her
so
prepossessing
eh
what
do
you
think
raskolnikov
did
not
speak
but
he
still
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
him
full
of
alarm
and
all
that
could
be
wished
indeed
in
every
respect
razumihin
went
on
not
at
all
embarrassed
by
his
silence
ah
the
sly
dog
nastasya
shrieked
again
this
conversation
afforded
her
unspeakable
delight
it
s
a
pity
brother
that
you
did
not
set
to
work
in
the
right
way
at
first
you
ought
to
have
approached
her
differently
she
is
so
to
speak
a
most
unaccountable
character
but
we
will
talk
about
her
character
later
how
could
you
let
things
come
to
such
a
pass
that
she
gave
up
sending
you
your
dinner
and
that
i
o
u
you
must
have
been
mad
to
sign
an
i
o
u
and
that
promise
of
marriage
when
her
daughter
natalya
yegorovna
was
alive
i
know
all
about
it
but
i
see
that
s
a
delicate
matter
and
i
am
an
ass
forgive
me
but
talking
of
foolishness
do
you
know
praskovya
pavlovna
is
not
nearly
so
foolish
as
you
would
think
at
first
sight
no
mumbled
raskolnikov
looking
away
but
feeling
that
it
was
better
to
keep
up
the
conversation
she
isn
t
is
she
cried
razumihin
delighted
to
get
an
answer
out
of
him
but
she
is
not
very
clever
either
eh
she
is
essentially
essentially
an
unaccountable
character
i
am
sometimes
quite
at
a
loss
i
assure
you
she
must
be
forty
she
says
she
is
thirty
six
and
of
course
she
has
every
right
to
say
so
but
i
swear
i
judge
her
intellectually
simply
from
the
metaphysical
point
of
view
there
is
a
sort
of
symbolism
sprung
up
between
us
a
sort
of
algebra
or
what
not
i
don
t
understand
it
well
that
s
all
nonsense
only
seeing
that
you
are
not
a
student
now
and
have
lost
your
lessons
and
your
clothes
and
that
through
the
young
lady
s
death
she
has
no
need
to
treat
you
as
a
relation
she
suddenly
took
fright
and
as
you
hid
in
your
den
and
dropped
all
your
old
relations
with
her
she
planned
to
get
rid
of
you
and
she
s
been
cherishing
that
design
a
long
time
but
was
sorry
to
lose
the
i
o
u
for
you
assured
her
yourself
that
your
mother
would
pay
it
was
base
of
me
to
say
that
my
mother
herself
is
almost
a
beggar
and
i
told
a
lie
to
keep
my
lodging
and
be
fed
raskolnikov
said
loudly
and
distinctly
yes
you
did
very
sensibly
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
at
that
point
mr
tchebarov
turns
up
a
business
man
pashenka
would
never
have
thought
of
doing
anything
on
her
own
account
she
is
too
retiring
but
the
business
man
is
by
no
means
retiring
and
first
thing
he
puts
the
question
is
there
any
hope
of
realising
the
i
o
u
answer
there
is
because
he
has
a
mother
who
would
save
her
rodya
with
her
hundred
and
twenty
five
roubles
pension
if
she
has
to
starve
herself
and
a
sister
too
who
would
go
into
bondage
for
his
sake
that
s
what
he
was
building
upon
why
do
you
start
i
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
your
affairs
now
my
dear
boy
it
s
not
for
nothing
that
you
were
so
open
with
pashenka
when
you
were
her
prospective
son
in
law
and
i
say
all
this
as
a
friend
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
an
honest
and
sensitive
man
is
open
and
a
business
man
listens
and
goes
on
eating
you
up
well
then
she
gave
the
i
o
u
by
way
of
payment
to
this
tchebarov
and
without
hesitation
he
made
a
formal
demand
for
payment
when
i
heard
of
all
this
i
wanted
to
blow
him
up
too
to
clear
my
conscience
but
by
that
time
harmony
reigned
between
me
and
pashenka
and
i
insisted
on
stopping
the
whole
affair
engaging
that
you
would
pay
i
went
security
for
you
brother
do
you
understand
we
called
tchebarov
flung
him
ten
roubles
and
got
the
i
o
u
back
from
him
and
here
i
have
the
honour
of
presenting
it
to
you
she
trusts
your
word
now
here
take
it
you
see
i
have
torn
it
razumihin
put
the
note
on
the
table
raskolnikov
looked
at
him
and
turned
to
the
wall
without
uttering
a
word
even
razumihin
felt
a
twinge
i
see
brother
he
said
a
moment
later
that
i
have
been
playing
the
fool
again
i
thought
i
should
amuse
you
with
my
chatter
and
i
believe
i
have
only
made
you
cross
was
it
you
i
did
not
recognise
when
i
was
delirious
raskolnikov
asked
after
a
moment
s
pause
without
turning
his
head
yes
and
you
flew
into
a
rage
about
it
especially
when
i
brought
zametov
one
day
zametov
the
head
clerk
what
for
raskolnikov
turned
round
quickly
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
razumihin
what
s
the
matter
with
you
what
are
you
upset
about
he
wanted
to
make
your
acquaintance
because
i
talked
to
him
a
lot
about
you
how
could
i
have
found
out
so
much
except
from
him
he
is
a
capital
fellow
brother
first
rate
in
his
own
way
of
course
now
we
are
friends
see
each
other
almost
every
day
i
have
moved
into
this
part
you
know
i
have
only
just
moved
i
ve
been
with
him
to
luise
ivanovna
once
or
twice
do
you
remember
luise
luise
ivanovna
did
i
say
anything
in
delirium
i
should
think
so
you
were
beside
yourself
what
did
i
rave
about
what
next
what
did
you
rave
about
what
people
do
rave
about
well
brother
now
i
must
not
lose
time
to
work
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
took
up
his
cap
what
did
i
rave
about
how
he
keeps
on
are
you
afraid
of
having
let
out
some
secret
don
t
worry
yourself
you
said
nothing
about
a
countess
but
you
said
a
lot
about
a
bulldog
and
about
ear
rings
and
chains
and
about
krestovsky
island
and
some
porter
and
nikodim
fomitch
and
ilya
petrovitch
the
assistant
superintendent
and
another
thing
that
was
of
special
interest
to
you
was
your
own
sock
you
whined
give
me
my
sock
zametov
hunted
all
about
your
room
for
your
socks
and
with
his
own
scented
ring
bedecked
fingers
he
gave
you
the
rag
and
only
then
were
you
comforted
and
for
the
next
twenty
four
hours
you
held
the
wretched
thing
in
your
hand
we
could
not
get
it
from
you
it
is
most
likely
somewhere
under
your
quilt
at
this
moment
and
then
you
asked
so
piteously
for
fringe
for
your
trousers
we
tried
to
find
out
what
sort
of
fringe
but
we
could
not
make
it
out
now
to
business
here
are
thirty
five
roubles
i
take
ten
of
them
and
shall
give
you
an
account
of
them
in
an
hour
or
two
i
will
let
zossimov
know
at
the
same
time
though
he
ought
to
have
been
here
long
ago
for
it
is
nearly
twelve
and
you
nastasya
look
in
pretty
often
while
i
am
away
to
see
whether
he
wants
a
drink
or
anything
else
and
i
will
tell
pashenka
what
is
wanted
myself
good
bye
he
calls
her
pashenka
ah
he
s
a
deep
one
said
nastasya
as
he
went
out
then
she
opened
the
door
and
stood
listening
but
could
not
resist
running
downstairs
after
him
she
was
very
eager
to
hear
what
he
would
say
to
the
landlady
she
was
evidently
quite
fascinated
by
razumihin
no
sooner
had
she
left
the
room
than
the
sick
man
flung
off
the
bedclothes
and
leapt
out
of
bed
like
a
madman
with
burning
twitching
impatience
he
had
waited
for
them
to
be
gone
so
that
he
might
set
to
work
but
to
what
work
now
as
though
to
spite
him
it
eluded
him
good
god
only
tell
me
one
thing
do
they
know
of
it
yet
or
not
what
if
they
know
it
and
are
only
pretending
mocking
me
while
i
am
laid
up
and
then
they
will
come
in
and
tell
me
that
it
s
been
discovered
long
ago
and
that
they
have
only
what
am
i
to
do
now
that
s
what
i
ve
forgotten
as
though
on
purpose
forgotten
it
all
at
once
i
remembered
a
minute
ago
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
gazed
in
miserable
bewilderment
about
him
he
walked
to
the
door
opened
it
listened
but
that
was
not
what
he
wanted
suddenly
as
though
recalling
something
he
rushed
to
the
corner
where
there
was
a
hole
under
the
paper
began
examining
it
put
his
hand
into
the
hole
fumbled
but
that
was
not
it
he
went
to
the
stove
opened
it
and
began
rummaging
in
the
ashes
the
frayed
edges
of
his
trousers
and
the
rags
cut
off
his
pocket
were
lying
there
just
as
he
had
thrown
them
no
one
had
looked
then
then
he
remembered
the
sock
about
which
razumihin
had
just
been
telling
him
yes
there
it
lay
on
the
sofa
under
the
quilt
but
it
was
so
covered
with
dust
and
grime
that
zametov
could
not
have
seen
anything
on
it
bah
zametov
the
police
office
and
why
am
i
sent
for
to
the
police
office
where
s
the
notice
bah
i
am
mixing
it
up
that
was
then
i
looked
at
my
sock
then
too
but
now
now
i
have
been
ill
but
what
did
zametov
come
for
why
did
razumihin
bring
him
he
muttered
helplessly
sitting
on
the
sofa
again
what
does
it
mean
am
i
still
in
delirium
or
is
it
real
i
believe
it
is
real
ah
i
remember
i
must
escape
make
haste
to
escape
yes
i
must
i
must
escape
yes
but
where
and
where
are
my
clothes
i
ve
no
boots
they
ve
taken
them
away
they
ve
hidden
them
i
understand
ah
here
is
my
coat
they
passed
that
over
and
here
is
money
on
the
table
thank
god
and
here
s
the
i
o
u
i
ll
take
the
money
and
go
and
take
another
lodging
they
won
t
find
me
yes
but
the
address
bureau
they
ll
find
me
razumihin
will
find
me
better
escape
altogether
far
away
to
america
and
let
them
do
their
worst
and
take
the
i
o
u
it
would
be
of
use
there
what
else
shall
i
take
they
think
i
am
ill
they
don
t
know
that
i
can
walk
ha
ha
ha
i
could
see
by
their
eyes
that
they
know
all
about
it
if
only
i
could
get
downstairs
and
what
if
they
have
set
a
watch
there
policemen
what
s
this
tea
ah
and
here
is
beer
left
half
a
bottle
cold
he
snatched
up
the
bottle
which
still
contained
a
glassful
of
beer
and
gulped
it
down
with
relish
as
though
quenching
a
flame
in
his
breast
but
in
another
minute
the
beer
had
gone
to
his
head
and
a
faint
and
even
pleasant
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
he
lay
down
and
pulled
the
quilt
over
him
his
sick
and
incoherent
thoughts
grew
more
and
more
disconnected
and
soon
a
light
pleasant
drowsiness
came
upon
him
with
a
sense
of
comfort
he
nestled
his
head
into
the
pillow
wrapped
more
closely
about
him
the
soft
wadded
quilt
which
had
replaced
the
old
ragged
greatcoat
sighed
softly
and
sank
into
a
deep
sound
refreshing
sleep
he
woke
up
hearing
someone
come
in
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
razumihin
standing
in
the
doorway
uncertain
whether
to
come
in
or
not
raskolnikov
sat
up
quickly
on
the
sofa
and
gazed
at
him
as
though
trying
to
recall
something
ah
you
are
not
asleep
here
i
am
nastasya
bring
in
the
parcel
razumihin
shouted
down
the
stairs

shall
have
the
account

time

asked
raskolnikov
looking
round
uneasily
yes

a
fine
sleep

almost

will
be
six
o
clock

hours

waiting
for
the
last
three
hours
for
you
i
ve
been
up
twice
and
found
you
asleep
i
ve
called
on
zossimov
twice
not
at
home
only

but
no
matter

will
turn
up
and
i
ve
been
out
on
my
own
business
too
you
know
i
ve
been
moving
to
day
moving
with
my
uncle
i
have
an
uncle
living
with
me
now
but
that
s
no

to
business
give
me
the
parcel
nastasya
we
will
open
it
directly
and
how
do
you
feel
now
brother
i
am
quite
well
i
am
not
ill
razumihin
have
you
been
here
long
i
tell
you
i
ve
been
waiting
for
the
last
three
hours
no
before
how
do
you
mean
how
long
have
you
been
coming
here
why
i
told
you
all
about
it
this
morning
don
t
you
remember
raskolnikov
pondered
the
morning
seemed
like
a
dream
to
him
he
could
not
remember
alone
and
looked
inquiringly
at
razumihin
hm
said
the
latter
he
has
forgotten
i
fancied
then
that
you
were
not
quite
yourself
now
you
are
better
for
your
sleep
you
really
look
much
better
first
rate
well
to
business
look
here
my
dear
boy
he
began
untying
the
bundle
which
evidently
interested
him
believe
me
brother
this
is
something
specially
near
my
heart
for
we
must
make
a
man
of
you
let
s
begin
from
the
top
do
you
see
this
cap
he
said
taking
out
of
the
bundle
a
fairly
good
though
cheap
and
ordinary
cap
let
me
try
it
on
presently
afterwards
said
raskolnikov
waving
it
off
pettishly
come
rodya
my
boy
don
t
oppose
it
afterwards
will
be
too
late
and
i
shan
t
sleep
all
night
for
i
bought
it
by
guess
without
measure
just
right
he
cried
triumphantly
fitting
it
on
just
your
size
a
proper
head
covering
is
the
first
thing
in
dress
and
a
recommendation
in
its
own
way
tolstyakov
a
friend
of
mine
is
always
obliged
to
take
off
his
pudding
basin
when
he
goes
into
any
public
place
where
other
people
wear
their
hats
or
caps
people
think
he
does
it
from
slavish
politeness
but
it
s
simply
because
he
is
ashamed
of
his
bird
s
nest
he
is
such
a
boastful
fellow
look
nastasya
here
are
two
specimens
of
headgear
this
palmerston
he
took
from
the
corner
raskolnikov
s
old
battered
hat
which
for
some
unknown
reason
he
called
a
palmerston
or
this
jewel
guess
the
price
rodya
what
do
you
suppose
i
paid
for
it
nastasya
he
said
turning
to
her
seeing
that
raskolnikov
did
not
speak
twenty
copecks
no
more
i
dare
say
answered
nastasya
twenty
copecks
silly
he
cried
offended
why
nowadays
you
would
cost
more
than
that
eighty
copecks
and
that
only
because
it
has
been
worn
and
it
s
bought
on
condition
that
when
s
it
s
worn
out
they
will
give
you
another
next
year
yes
on
my
word
well
now
let
us
pass
to
the
united
states
of
america
as
they
called
them
at
school
i
assure
you
i
am
proud
of
these
breeches
and
he
exhibited
to
raskolnikov
a
pair
of
light
summer
trousers
of
grey
woollen
material
no
holes
no
spots
and
quite
respectable
although
a
little
worn
and
a
waistcoat
to
match
quite
in
the
fashion
and
its
being
worn
really
is
an
improvement
it
s
softer
smoother
you
see
rodya
to
my
thinking
the
great
thing
for
getting
on
in
the
world
is
always
to
keep
to
the
seasons
if
you
don
t
insist
on
having
asparagus
in
january
you
keep
your
money
in
your
purse
and
it
s
the
same
with
this
purchase
it
s
summer
now
so
i
ve
been
buying
summer
things
warmer
materials
will
be
wanted
for
autumn
so
you
will
have
to
throw
these
away
in
any
case
especially
as
they
will
be
done
for
by
then
from
their
own
lack
of
coherence
if
not
your
higher
standard
of
luxury
come
price
them
what
do
you
say
two
roubles
twenty
five
copecks
and
remember
the
condition
if
you
wear
these
out
you
will
have
another
suit
for
nothing
they
only
do
business
on
that
system
at
fedyaev
s
if
you
ve
bought
a
thing
once
you
are
satisfied
for
life
for
you
will
never
go
there
again
of
your
own
free
will
now
for
the
boots
what
do
you
say
you
see
that
they
are
a
bit
worn
but
they
ll
last
a
couple
of
months
for
it
s
foreign
work
and
foreign
leather
the
secretary
of
the
english
embassy
sold
them
last
week
he
had
only
worn
them
six
days
but
he
was
very
short
of
cash
price
a
rouble
and
a
half
a
bargain
but
perhaps
they
won
t
fit
observed
nastasya
not
fit
just
look
and
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
raskolnikov
s
old
broken
boot
stiffly
coated
with
dry
mud
i
did
not
go
empty
handed
they
took
the
size
from
this
monster
we
all
did
our
best
and
as
to
your
linen
your
landlady
has
seen
to
that
here
to
begin
with
are
three
shirts
hempen
but
with
a
fashionable
front
well
now
then
eighty
copecks
the
cap
two
roubles
twenty
five
copecks
the
suit
together
three
roubles
five
copecks
a
rouble
and
a
half
for
the
boots
for
you
see
they
are
very
good
and
that
makes
four
roubles
fifty
five
copecks
five
roubles
for
the
underclothes
they
were
bought
in
the
lo
which
makes
exactly
nine
roubles
fifty
five
copecks
forty
five
copecks
change
in
coppers
will
you
take
it
and
so
rodya
you
are
set
up
with
a
complete
new
rig
out
for
your
overcoat
will
serve
and
even
has
a
style
of
its
own
that
comes
from
getting
one
s
clothes
from
sharmer
s
as
for
your
socks
and
other
things
i
leave
them
to
you
we
ve
twenty
five
roubles
left
and
as
for
pashenka
and
paying
for
your
lodging
don
t

tell
you
she
ll
trust
you
for
anything
and
now
brother

linen

i
daresay
you
will
throw
off
your
illness
with
your
shirt
let
me
be
i
don
t
want
to
raskolnikov
waved
him
off
he
had
listened
with
disgust
to
razumihin
s
efforts
to
be
playful
about
his
purchases
come
brother
don
t
tell
me
i
ve
been
trudging
around
for
nothing
razumihin
insisted
nastasya
don
t
be
bashful
but
help
me
that
s
it
and
in
spite
of
raskolnikov
s
resistance
he
changed
his
linen
the
latter
sank
back
on
the
pillows
and
for
a
minute
or
two
said
nothing
it
will
be
long
before
i
get
rid
of
them
he
thought
what
money
was
all
that
bought
with
he
asked
at
last
gazing
at
the
wall
money
why
your
own
what
the
messenger
brought
from
vahrushin
your
mother
sent
it
have
you
forgotten
that
too
i
remember
now
said
raskolnikov
after
a
long
sullen
silence
razumihin
looked
at
him
frowning
and
uneasy
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
stout
man
whose
appearance
seemed
familiar
to
raskolnikov
came
in
chapter
iv
zossimov
was
a
tall
fat
man
with
a
puffy
colourless
clean
shaven
face
and
straight
flaxen
hair
he
wore
spectacles
and
a
big
gold
ring
on
his
fat
finger
he
was
twenty
seven
he
had
on
a
light
grey
fashionable
loose
coat
light
summer
trousers
and
everything
about
him
loose
fashionable
and
spick
and
span
his
linen
was
irreproachable
his
watch
chain
was
massive
in
manner
he
was
slow
and
as
it
were
nonchalant
and
at
the
same
time
studiously
free
and
easy
he
made
efforts
to
conceal
his
self
importance
but
it
was
apparent
at
every
instant
all
his
acquaintances
found
him
tedious
but
said
he
was
clever
at
his
work
i
ve
been
to
you
twice
to
day
brother
you
see
he
s
come
to
himself
cried
razumihin
i
see
i
see
and
how
do
we
feel
now
eh
said
zossimov
to
raskolnikov
watching
him
carefully
and
sitting
down
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
he
settled
himself
as
comfortably
as
he
could
he
is
still
depressed
razumihin
went
on
we
ve
just
changed
his
linen
and
he
almost
cried
that
s
very
natural
you
might
have
put
it
off
if
he
did
not
wish
it
his
pulse
is
first
rate
is
your
head
still
aching
eh
i
am
well
i
am
perfectly
well
raskolnikov
declared
positively
and
irritably
he
raised
himself
on
the
sofa
and
looked
at
them
with
glittering
eyes
but
sank
back
on
to
the
pillow
at
once
and
turned
to
the
wall
zossimov
watched
him
intently
very
good
going
on
all
right
he
said
lazily
has
he
eaten
anything
they
told
him
and
asked
what
he
might
have
he
may
have
anything
soup
tea
mushrooms
and
cucumbers
of
course
you
must
not
give
him
he
d
better
not
have
meat
either
and
but
no
need
to
tell
you
that
razumihin
and
he
looked
at
each
other
no
more
medicine
or
anything
i
ll
look
at
him
again
to
morrow
perhaps
to
day
even
but
never
mind
to
morrow
evening
i
shall
take
him
for
a
walk
said
razumihin
we
are
going
to
the
yusupov
garden
and
then
to
the
palais
de
crystal
i
would
not
disturb
him
to
morrow
at
all
but
i
don
t
know
a
little
maybe
but
we
ll
see
ach
what
a
nuisance
i
ve
got
a
house
warming
party
to
night
it
s
only
a
step
from
here
couldn
t
he
come
he
could
lie
on
the
sofa
you
are
coming
razumihin
said
to
zossimov
don
t
forget
you
promised
all
right
only
rather
later
what
are
you
going
to
do
oh
nothing
tea
vodka
herrings
there
will
be
a
pie
just
our
friends
and
who
all
neighbours
here
almost
all
new
friends
except
my
old
uncle
and
he
is
new
too
he
only
arrived
in
petersburg
yesterday
to
see
to
some
business
of
his
we
meet
once
in
five
years
what
is
he
he
s
been
stagnating
all
his
life
as
a
district
postmaster
gets
a
little
pension
he
is
sixty
five
not
worth
talking
about
but
i
am
fond
of
him
porfiry
petrovitch
the
head
of
the
investigation
department
here
but
you
know
him
is
he
a
relation
of
yours
too
a
very
distant
one
but
why
are
you
scowling
because
you
quarrelled
once
won
t
you
come
then
i
don
t
care
a
damn
for
him
so
much
the
better
well
there
will
be
some
students
a
teacher
a
government
clerk
a
musician
an
officer
and
zametov
do
tell
me
please
what
you
or
he
zossimov
nodded
at
raskolnikov
can
have
in
common
with
this
zametov
oh
you
particular
gentleman
principles
you
are
worked
by
principles
as
it
were
by
springs
you
won
t
venture
to
turn
round
on
your
own
account
if
a
man
is
a
nice
fellow
that
s
the
only
principle
i
go
upon
zametov
is
a
delightful
person
though
he
does
take
bribes
well
he
does
and
what
of
it
i
don
t
care
if
he
does
take
bribes
razumihin
cried
with
unnatural
irritability
i
don
t
praise
him
for
taking
bribes
i
only
say
he
is
a
nice
man
in
his
own
way
but
if
one
looks
at
men
in
all
ways
are
there
many
good
ones
left
why
i
am
sure
i
shouldn
t
be
worth
a
baked
onion
myself
perhaps
with
you
thrown
in
that
s
too
little
i
d
give
two
for
you
and
i
wouldn
t
give
more
than
one
for
you
no
more
of
your
jokes
zametov
is
no
more
than
a
boy
i
can
pull
his
hair
and
one
must
draw
him
not
repel
him
you
ll
never
improve
a
man
by
repelling
him
especially
a
boy
one
has
to
be
twice
as
careful
with
a
boy
oh
you
progressive
dullards
you
don
t
understand
you
harm
yourselves
running
another
man
down
but
if
you
want
to
know
we
really
have
something
in
common
i
should
like
to
know
what
why
it
s
all
about
a
house
painter
we
are
getting
him
out
of
a
mess
though
indeed
there
s
nothing
to
fear
now
the
matter
is
absolutely
self
evident
we
only
put
on
steam
a
painter
why
haven
t
i
told
you
about
it
i
only
told
you
the
beginning
then
about
the
murder
of
the
old
pawnbroker
woman
well
the
painter
is
mixed
up
in
it
oh
i
heard
about
that
murder
before
and
was
rather
interested
in
it
partly
for
one
reason
i
read
about
it
in
the
papers
too
lizaveta
was
murdered
too
nastasya
blurted
out
suddenly
addressing
raskolnikov
she
remained
in
the
room
all
the
time
standing
by
the
door
listening
lizaveta
murmured
raskolnikov
hardly
audibly
lizaveta
who
sold
old
clothes
didn
t
you
know
her
she
used
to
come
here
she
mended
a
shirt
for
you
too
raskolnikov
turned
to
the
wall
where
in
the
dirty
yellow
paper
he
picked
out
one
clumsy
white
flower
with
brown
lines
on
it
and
began
examining
how
many
petals
there
were
in
it
how
many
scallops
in
the
petals
and
how
many
lines
on
them
he
felt
his
arms
and
legs
as
lifeless
as
though
they
had
been
cut
off
he
did
not
attempt
to
move
but
stared
obstinately
at
the
flower
but
what
about
the
painter
zossimov
interrupted
nastasya
s
chatter
with
marked
displeasure
she
sighed
and
was
silent
why
he
was
accused
of
the
murder
razumihin
went
on
hotly
was
there
evidence
against
him
then
evidence
indeed
evidence
that
was
no
evidence
and
that
s
what
we
have
to
prove
it
was
just
as
they
pitched
on
those
fellows
koch
and
pestryakov
at
first
foo
how
stupidly
it
s
all
done
it
makes
one
sick
though
it
s
not
one
s
business
pestryakov
may
be
coming
to
night
by
the
way
rodya
you
ve
heard
about
the
business
already
it
happened
before
you
were
ill
the
day
before
you
fainted
at
the
police
office
while
they
were
talking
about
it
zossimov
looked
curiously
at
raskolnikov
he
did
not
stir
but
i
say
razumihin
i
wonder
at
you
what
a
busybody
you
are
zossimov
observed
maybe
i
am
but
we
will
get
him
off
anyway
shouted
razumihin
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
what
s
the
most
offensive
is
not
their
lying
one
can
always
forgive
lying
lying
is
a
delightful
thing
for
it
leads
to
truth
what
is
offensive
is
that
they
lie
and
worship
their
own
lying
i
respect
porfiry
but
what
threw
them
out
at
first
the
door
was
locked
and
when
they
came
back
with
the
porter
it
was
open
so
it
followed
that
koch
and
pestryakov
were
the
murderers
that
was
their
logic
but
don
t
excite
yourself
they
simply
detained
them
they
could
not
help
that
and
by
the
way
i
ve
met
that
man
koch
he
used
to
buy
unredeemed
pledges
from
the
old
woman
eh
yes
he
is
a
swindler
he
buys
up
bad
debts
too
he
makes
a
profession
of
it
but
enough
of
him
do
you
know
what
makes
me
angry
it
s
their
sickening
rotten
petrified
routine
and
this
case
might
be
the
means
of
introducing
a
new
method
one
can
show
from
the
psychological
data
alone
how
to
get
on
the
track
of
the
real
man
we
have
facts
they
say
but
facts
are
not
everything
at
least
half
the
business
lies
in
how
you
interpret
them
can
you
interpret
them
then
anyway
one
can
t
hold
one
s
tongue
when
one
has
a
feeling
a
tangible
feeling
that
one
might
be
a
help
if
only
eh
do
you
know
the
details
of
the
case
i
am
waiting
to
hear
about
the
painter
oh
yes
well
here
s
the
story
early
on
the
third
day
after
the
murder
when
they
were
still
dandling
koch
and
pestryakov
though
they
accounted
for
every
step
they
took
and
it
was
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
an
unexpected
fact
turned
up
a
peasant
called
dushkin
who
keeps
a
dram
shop
facing
the
house
brought
to
the
police
office
a
jeweller
s
case
containing
some
gold
ear
rings
and
told
a
long
rigamarole
the
day
before
yesterday
just
after
eight
o
clock
mark
the
day
and
the
hour
a
journeyman
house
painter
nikolay
who
had
been
in
to
see
me
already
that
day
brought
me
this
box
of
gold
ear
rings
and
stones
and
asked
me
to
give
him
two
roubles
for
them
when
i
asked
him
where
he
got
them
he
said
that
he
picked
them
up
in
the
street
i
did
not
ask
him
anything
more
i
am
telling
you
dushkin
s
story
i
gave
him
a
note
a
rouble
that
is
for
i
thought
if
he
did
not
pawn
it
with
me
he
would
with
another
it
would
all
come
to
the
same
thing
he
d
spend
it
on
drink
so
the
thing
had
better
be
with
me
the
further
you
hide
it
the
quicker
you
will
find
it
and
if
anything
turns
up
if
i
hear
any
rumours
i
ll
take
it
to
the
police
of
course
that
s
all
taradiddle
he
lies
like
a
horse
for
i
know
this
dushkin
he
is
a
pawnbroker
and
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
and
he
did
not
cheat
nikolay
out
of
a
thirty
rouble
trinket
in
order
to
give
it
to
the
police
he
was
simply
afraid
but
no
matter
to
return
to
dushkin
s
story
i
ve
known
this
peasant
nikolay
dementyev
from
a
child
he
comes
from
the
same
province
and
district
of
zara
sk
we
are
both
ryazan
men
and
though
nikolay
is
not
a
drunkard
he
drinks
and
i
knew
he
had
a
job
in
that
house
painting
work
with
dmitri
who
comes
from
the
same
village
too
as
soon
as
he
got
the
rouble
he
changed
it
had
a
couple
of
glasses
took
his
change
and
went
out
but
i
did
not
see
dmitri
with
him
then
and
the
next
day
i
heard
that
someone
had
murdered
alyona
ivanovna
and
her
sister
lizaveta
ivanovna
with
an
axe
i
knew
them
and
i
felt
suspicious
about
the
ear
rings
at
once
for
i
knew
the
murdered
woman
lent
money
on
pledges
i
went
to
the
house
and
began
to
make
careful
inquiries
without
saying
a
word
to
anyone
first
of
all
i
asked
is
nikolay
here
dmitri
told
me
that
nikolay
had
gone
off
on
the
spree
he
had
come
home
at
daybreak
drunk
stayed
in
the
house
about
ten
minutes
and
went
out
again
dmitri
didn
t
see
him
again
and
is
finishing
the
job
alone
and
their
job
is
on
the
same
staircase
as
the
murder
on
the
second
floor
when
i
heard
all
that
i
did
not
say
a
word
to
anyone
that
s
dushkin
s
tale
but
i
found
out
what
i
could
about
the
murder
and
went
home
feeling
as
suspicious
as
ever
and
at
eight
o
clock
this
morning
that
was
the
third
day
you
understand
i
saw
nikolay
coming
in
not
sober
though
not
to
say
very
drunk
he
could
understand
what
was
said
to
him
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
did
not
speak
there
was
only
one
stranger
in
the
bar
and
a
man
i
knew
asleep
on
a
bench
and
our
two
boys
have
you
seen
dmitri
said
i
no
i
haven
t
said
he
and
you
ve
not
been
here
either
not
since
the
day
before
yesterday
said
he
and
where
did
you
sleep
last
night
in
peski
with
the
kolomensky
men
and
where
did
you
get
those
ear
rings
i
asked
i
found
them
in
the
street
and
the
way
he
said
it
was
a
bit
queer
he
did
not
look
at
me
did
you
hear
what
happened
that
very
evening
at
that
very
hour
on
that
same
staircase
said
i
no
said
he
i
had
not
heard
and
all
the
while
he
was
listening
his
eyes
were
staring
out
of
his
head
and
he
turned
as
white
as
chalk
i
told
him
all
about
it
and
he
took
his
hat
and
began
getting
up
i
wanted
to
keep
him
wait
a
bit
nikolay
said
i
won
t
you
have
a
drink
and
i
signed
to
the
boy
to
hold
the
door
and
i
came
out
from
behind
the
bar
but
he
darted
out
and
down
the
street
to
the
turning
at
a
run
i
have
not
seen
him
since
then
my
doubts
were
at
an
end
it
was
his
doing
as
clear
as
could
be
i
should
think
so
said
zossimov
wait
hear
the
end
of
course
they
sought
high
and
low
for
nikolay
they
detained
dushkin
and
searched
his
house
dmitri
too
was
arrested
the
kolomensky
men
also
were
turned
inside
out
and
the
day
before
yesterday
they
arrested
nikolay
in
a
tavern
at
the
end
of
the
town
he
had
gone
there
taken
the
silver
cross
off
his
neck
and
asked
for
a
dram
for
it
they
gave
it
to
him
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
woman
went
to
the
cowshed
and
through
a
crack
in
the
wall
she
saw
in
the
stable
adjoining
he
had
made
a
noose
of
his
sash
from
the
beam
stood
on
a
block
of
wood
and
was
trying
to
put
his
neck
in
the
noose
the
woman
screeched
her
hardest
people
ran
in
so
that
s
what
you
are
up
to
take
me
he
says
to
such
and
such
a
police
officer
i
ll
confess
everything
well
they
took
him
to
that
police
station
that
is
here
with
a
suitable
escort
so
they
asked
him
this
and
that
how
old
he
is
twenty
two
and
so
on
at
the
question
when
you
were
working
with
dmitri
didn
t
you
see
anyone
on
the
staircase
at
such
and
such
a
time
answer
to
be
sure
folks
may
have
gone
up
and
down
but
i
did
not
notice
them
and
didn
t
you
hear
anything
any
noise
and
so
on
we
heard
nothing
special
and
did
you
hear
nikolay
that
on
the
same
day
widow
so
and
so
and
her
sister
were
murdered
and
robbed
i
never
knew
a
thing
about
it
the
first
i
heard
of
it
was
from
afanasy
pavlovitch
the
day
before
yesterday
and
where
did
you
find
the
ear
rings
i
found
them
on
the
pavement
why
didn
t
you
go
to
work
with
dmitri
the
other
day
because
i
was
drinking
and
where
were
you
drinking
oh
in
such
and
such
a
place
why
did
you
run
away
from
dushkin
s
because
i
was
awfully
frightened
what
were
you
frightened
of
that
i
should
be
accused
how
could
you
be
frightened
if
you
felt
free
from
guilt
now
zossimov
you
may
not
believe
me
that
question
was
put
literally
in
those
words
i
know
it
for
a
fact
it
was
repeated
to
me
exactly
what
do
you
say
to
that
well
anyway
there
s
the
evidence
i
am
not
talking
of
the
evidence
now
i
am
talking
about
that
question
of
their
own
idea
of
themselves
well
so
they
squeezed
and
squeezed
him
and
he
confessed
i
did
not
find
it
in
the
street
but
in
the
flat
where
i
was
painting
with
dmitri
and
how
was
that
why
dmitri
and
i
were
painting
there
all
day
and
we
were
just
getting
ready
to
go
and
dmitri
took
a
brush
and
painted
my
face
and
he
ran
off
and
i
after
him
i
ran
after
him
shouting
my
hardest
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
i
ran
right
against
the
porter
and
some
gentlemen
and
how
many
gentlemen
were
there
i
don
t
remember
and
the
porter
swore
at
me
and
the
other
porter
swore
too
and
the
porter
s
wife
came
out
and
swore
at
us
too
and
a
gentleman
came
into
the
entry
with
a
lady
and
he
swore
at
us
too
for
dmitri
and
i
lay
right
across
the
way
i
got
hold
of
dmitri
s
hair
and
knocked
him
down
and
began
beating
him
and
dmitri
too
caught
me
by
the
hair
and
began
beating
me
but
we
did
it
all
not
for
temper
but
in
a
friendly
way
for
sport
and
then
dmitri
escaped
and
ran
into
the
street
and
i
ran
after
him
but
i
did
not
catch
him
and
went
back
to
the
flat
alone
i
had
to
clear
up
my
things
i
began
putting
them
together
expecting
dmitri
to
come
and
there
in
the
passage
in
the
corner
by
the
door
i
stepped
on
the
box
i
saw
it
lying
there
wrapped
up
in
paper
i
took
off
the
paper
saw
some
little
hooks
undid
them
and
in
the
box
were
the
ear
rings
behind
the
door
lying
behind
the
door
behind
the
door
raskolnikov
cried
suddenly
staring
with
a
blank
look
of
terror
at
razumihin
and
he
slowly
sat
up
on
the
sofa
leaning
on
his
hand
yes
why
what
s
the
matter
what
s
wrong
razumihin
too
got
up
from
his
seat
nothing
raskolnikov
answered
faintly
turning
to
the
wall
all
were
silent
for
a
while
he
must
have
waked
from
a
dream
razumihin
said
at
last
looking
inquiringly
at
zossimov
the
latter
slightly
shook
his
head
well
go
on
said
zossimov
what
next
what
next
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
ear
rings
forgetting
dmitri
and
everything
he
took
up
his
cap
and
ran
to
dushkin
and
as
we
know
got
a
rouble
from
him
he
told
a
lie
saying
he
found
them
in
the
street
and
went
off
drinking
he
keeps
repeating
his
old
story
about
the
murder
i
know
nothing
of
it
never
heard
of
it
till
the
day
before
yesterday
and
why
didn
t
you
come
to
the
police
till
now
i
was
frightened
and
why
did
you
try
to
hang
yourself
from
anxiety
what
anxiety
that
i
should
be
accused
of
it
well
that
s
the
whole
story
and
now
what
do
you
suppose
they
deduced
from
that
why
there
s
no
supposing
there
s
a
clue
such
as
it
is
a
fact
you
wouldn
t
have
your
painter
set
free
now
they
ve
simply
taken
him
for
the
murderer
they
haven
t
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
s
nonsense
you
are
excited
but
what
about
the
ear
rings
you
must
admit
that
if
on
the
very
same
day
and
hour
ear
rings
from
the
old
woman
s
box
have
come
into
nikolay
s
hands
they
must
have
come
there
somehow
that
s
a
good
deal
in
such
a
case
how
did
they
get
there
how
did
they
get
there
cried
razumihin
how
can
you
a
doctor
whose
duty
it
is
to
study
man
and
who
has
more
opportunity
than
anyone
else
for
studying
human
nature
how
can
you
fail
to
see
the
character
of
the
man
in
the
whole
story
don
t
you
see
at
once
that
the
answers
he
has
given
in
the
examination
are
the
holy
truth
they
came
into
his
hand
precisely
as
he
has
told
us
he
stepped
on
the
box
and
picked
it
up
the
holy
truth
but
didn
t
he
own
himself
that
he
told
a
lie
at
first
listen
to
me
listen
attentively
the
porter
and
koch
and
pestryakov
and
the
other
porter
and
the
wife
of
the
first
porter
and
the
woman
who
was
sitting
in
the
porter
s
lodge
and
the
man
kryukov
who
had
just
got
out
of
a
cab
at
that
minute
and
went
in
at
the
entry
with
a
lady
on
his
arm
that
is
eight
or
ten
witnesses
agree
that
nikolay
had
dmitri
on
the
ground
was
lying
on
him
beating
him
while
dmitri
hung
on
to
his
hair
beating
him
too
they
lay
right
across
the
way
blocking
the
thoroughfare
they
were
sworn
at
on
all
sides
while
they
like
children
the
very
words
of
the
witnesses
were
falling
over
one
another
squealing
fighting
and
laughing
with
the
funniest
faces
and
chasing
one
another
like
children
they
ran
into
the
street
now
take
careful
note
the
bodies
upstairs
were
warm
you
understand
warm
when
they
found
them
if
they
or
nikolay
alone
had
murdered
them
and
broken
open
the
boxes
or
simply
taken
part
in
the
robbery
allow
me
to
ask
you
one
question
do
their
state
of
mind
their
squeals
and
giggles
and
childish
scuffling
at
the
gate
fit
in
with
axes
bloodshed
fiendish
cunning
robbery
they
d
just
killed
them
not
five
or
ten
minutes
before
for
the
bodies
were
still
warm
and
at
once
leaving
the
flat
open
knowing
that
people
would
go
there
at
once
flinging
away
their
booty
they
rolled
about
like
children
laughing
and
attracting
general
attention
and
there
are
a
dozen
witnesses
to
swear
to
that
of
course
it
is
strange
it
s
impossible
indeed
but
no
brother
no
buts
and
if
the
ear
rings
being
found
in
nikolay
s
hands
at
the
very
day
and
hour
of
the
murder
constitutes
an
important
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
although
the
explanation
given
by
him
accounts
for
it
and
therefore
it
does
not
tell
seriously
against
him
one
must
take
into
consideration
the
facts
which
prove
him
innocent
especially
as
they
are
facts
that
cannot
be
denied
and
do
you
suppose
from
the
character
of
our
legal
system
that
they
will
accept
or
that
they
are
in
a
position
to
accept
this
fact
resting
simply
on
a
psychological
impossibility
as
irrefutable
and
conclusively
breaking
down
the
circumstantial
evidence
for
the
prosecution
no
they
won
t
accept
it
they
certainly
won
t
because
they
found
the
jewel
case
and
the
man
tried
to
hang
himself
which
he
could
not
have
done
if
he
hadn
t
felt
guilty
that
s
the
point
that
s
what
excites
me
you
must
understand
oh
i
see
you
are
excited
wait
a
bit
i
forgot
to
ask
you
what
proof
is
there
that
the
box
came
from
the
old
woman
that
s
been
proved
said
razumihin
with
apparent
reluctance
frowning
koch
recognised
the
jewel
case
and
gave
the
name
of
the
owner
who
proved
conclusively
that
it
was
his
that
s
bad
now
another
point
did
anyone
see
nikolay
at
the
time
that
koch
and
pestryakov
were
going
upstairs
at
first
and
is
there
no
evidence
about
that
nobody
did
see
him
razumihin
answered
with
vexation
that
s
the
worst
of
it
even
koch
and
pestryakov
did
not
notice
them
on
their
way
upstairs
though
indeed
their
evidence
could
not
have
been
worth
much
they
said
they
saw
the
flat
was
open
and
that
there
must
be
work
going
on
in
it
but
they
took
no
special
notice
and
could
not
remember
whether
there
actually
were
men
at
work
in
it
hm
so
the
only
evidence
for
the
defence
is
that
they
were
beating
one
another
and
laughing
that
constitutes
a
strong
presumption
but
how
do
you
explain
the
facts
yourself
how
do
i
explain
them
what
is
there
to
explain
it
s
clear
at
any
rate
the
direction
in
which
explanation
is
to
be
sought
is
clear
and
the
jewel
case
points
to
it
the
real
murderer
dropped
those
ear
rings
the
murderer
was
upstairs
locked
in
when
koch
and
pestryakov
knocked
at
the
door
koch
like
an
ass
did
not
stay
at
the
door
so
the
murderer
popped
out
and
ran
down
too
for
he
had
no
other
way
of
escape
he
hid
from
koch
pestryakov
and
the
porter
in
the
flat
when
nikolay
and
dmitri
had
just
run
out
of
it
he
stopped
there
while
the
porter
and
others
were
going
upstairs
waited
till
they
were
out
of
hearing
and
then
went
calmly
downstairs
at
the
very
minute
when
dmitri
and
nikolay
ran
out
into
the
street
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
entry
possibly
he
was
seen
but
not
noticed
there
are
lots
of
people
going
in
and
out
he
must
have
dropped
the
ear
rings
out
of
his
pocket
when
he
stood
behind
the
door
and
did
not
notice
he
dropped
them
because
he
had
other
things
to
think
of
the
jewel
case
is
a
conclusive
proof
that
he
did
stand
there
that
s
how
i
explain
it
too
clever
no
my
boy
you
re
too
clever
that
beats
everything
but
why
why
why
because
everything
fits
too
well
it
s
too
melodramatic
a
ach
razumihin
was
exclaiming
but
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
personage
came
in
who
was
a
stranger
to
all
present
chapter
v
this
was
a
gentleman
no
longer
young
of
a
stiff
and
portly
appearance
and
a
cautious
and
sour
countenance
he
began
by
stopping
short
in
the
doorway
staring
about
him
with
offensive
and
undisguised
astonishment
as
though
asking
himself
what
sort
of
place
he
had
come
to
mistrustfully
and
with
an
affectation
of
being
alarmed
and
almost
affronted
he
scanned
raskolnikov
s
low
and
narrow
cabin
with
the
same
amazement
he
stared
at
raskolnikov
who
lay
undressed
dishevelled
unwashed
on
his
miserable
dirty
sofa
looking
fixedly
at
him
then
with
the
same
deliberation
he
scrutinised
the
uncouth
unkempt
figure
and
unshaven
face
of
razumihin
who
looked
him
boldly
and
inquiringly
in
the
face
without
rising
from
his
seat
a
constrained
silence
lasted
for
a
couple
of
minutes
and
then
as
might
be
expected
some
scene
shifting
took
place
reflecting
probably
from
certain
fairly
unmistakable
signs
that
he
would
get
nothing
in
this
cabin
by
attempting
to
overawe
them
the
gentleman
softened
somewhat
and
civilly
though
with
some
severity
emphasising
every
syllable
of
his
question
addressed
zossimov
rodion
romanovitch
raskolnikov
a
student
or
formerly
a
student
zossimov
made
a
slight
movement
and
would
have
answered
had
not
razumihin
anticipated
him
here
he
is
lying
on
the
sofa
what
do
you
want
this
familiar
what
do
you
want
seemed
to
cut
the
ground
from
the
feet
of
the
pompous
gentleman
he
was
turning
to
razumihin
but
checked
himself
in
time
and
turned
to
zossimov
again
this
is
raskolnikov
mumbled
zossimov
nodding
towards
him
then
he
gave
a
prolonged
yawn
opening
his
mouth
as
wide
as
possible
then
he
lazily
put
his
hand
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
pulled
out
a
huge
gold
watch
in
a
round
hunter
s
case
opened
it
looked
at
it
and
as
slowly
and
lazily
proceeded
to
put
it
back
raskolnikov
himself
lay
without
speaking
on
his
back
gazing
persistently
though
without
understanding
at
the
stranger
now
that
his
face
was
turned
away
from
the
strange
flower
on
the
paper
it
was
extremely
pale
and
wore
a
look
of
anguish
as
though
he
had
just
undergone
an
agonising
operation
or
just
been
taken
from
the
rack
but
the
new
comer
gradually
began
to
arouse
his
attention
then
his
wonder
then
suspicion
and
even
alarm
when
zossimov
said
this
is
raskolnikov
he
jumped
up
quickly
sat
on
the
sofa
and
with
an
almost
defiant
but
weak
and
breaking
voice
articulated
yes
i
am
raskolnikov
what
do
you
want
the
visitor
scrutinised
him
and
pronounced
impressively
pyotr
petrovitch
luzhin
i
believe
i
have
reason
to
hope
that
my
name
is
not
wholly
unknown
to
you
but
raskolnikov
who
had
expected
something
quite
different
gazed
blankly
and
dreamily
at
him
making
no
reply
as
though
he
heard
the
name
of
pyotr
petrovitch
for
the
first
time
is
it
possible
that
you
can
up
to
the
present
have
received
no
information
asked
pyotr
petrovitch
somewhat
disconcerted
in
reply
raskolnikov
sank
languidly
back
on
the
pillow
put
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
gazed
at
the
ceiling
a
look
of
dismay
came
into
luzhin
s
face
zossimov
and
razumihin
stared
at
him
more
inquisitively
than
ever
and
at
last
he
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
embarrassment
i
had
presumed
and
calculated
he
faltered
that
a
letter
posted
more
than
ten
days
if
not
a
fortnight
ago
i
say
why
are
you
standing
in
the
doorway
razumihin
interrupted
suddenly
if
you
ve
something
to
say
sit
down
nastasya
and
you
are
so
crowded
nastasya
make
room
here
s
a
chair
thread
your
way
in
he
moved
his
chair
back
from
the
table
made
a
little
space
between
the
table
and
his
knees
and
waited
in
a
rather
cramped
position
for
the
visitor
to
thread
his
way
in
the
minute
was
so
chosen
that
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
and
the
visitor
squeezed
his
way
through
hurrying
and
stumbling
reaching
the
chair
he
sat
down
looking
suspiciously
at
razumihin
no
need
to
be
nervous
the
latter
blurted
out
rodya
has
been
ill
for
the
last
five
days
and
delirious
for
three
but
now
he
is
recovering
and
has
got
an
appetite
this
is
his
doctor
who
has
just
had
a
look
at
him
i
am
a
comrade
of
rodya
s
like
him
formerly
a
student
and
now
i
am
nursing
him
so
don
t
you
take
any
notice
of
us
but
go
on
with
your
business
thank
you
but
shall
i
not
disturb
the
invalid
by
my
presence
and
conversation
pyotr
petrovitch
asked
of
zossimov
n
no
mumbled
zossimov
you
may
amuse
him
he
yawned
again
he
has
been
conscious
a
long
time
since
the
morning
went
on
razumihin
whose
familiarity
seemed
so
much
like
unaffected
good
nature
that
pyotr
petrovitch
began
to
be
more
cheerful
partly
perhaps
because
this
shabby
and
impudent
person
had
introduced
himself
as
a
student
your
mamma
began
luzhin
hm
razumihin
cleared
his
throat
loudly
luzhin
looked
at
him
inquiringly
that
s
all
right
go
on
luzhin
shrugged
his
shoulders
your
mamma
had
commenced
a
letter
to
you
while
i
was
sojourning
in
her
neighbourhood
on
my
arrival
here
i
purposely
allowed
a
few
days
to
elapse
before
coming
to
see
you
in
order
that
i
might
be
fully
assured
that
you
were
in
full
possession
of
the
tidings
but
now
to
my
astonishment
i
know
i
know
raskolnikov
cried
suddenly
with
impatient
vexation
so
you
are
the
fianc
i
know
and
that
s
enough
there
was
no
doubt
about
pyotr
petrovitch
s
being
offended
this
time
but
he
said
nothing
he
made
a
violent
effort
to
understand
what
it
all
meant
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
meanwhile
raskolnikov
who
had
turned
a
little
towards
him
when
he
answered
began
suddenly
staring
at
him
again
with
marked
curiosity
as
though
he
had
not
had
a
good
look
at
him
yet
or
as
though
something
new
had
struck
him
he
rose
from
his
pillow
on
purpose
to
stare
at
him
there
certainly
was
something
peculiar
in
pyotr
petrovitch
s
whole
appearance
something
which
seemed
to
justify
the
title
of
fianc
so
unceremoniously
applied
to
him
in
the
first
place
it
was
evident
far
too
much
so
indeed
that
pyotr
petrovitch
had
made
eager
use
of
his
few
days
in
the
capital
to
get
himself
up
and
rig
himself
out
in
expectation
of
his
betrothed
a
perfectly
innocent
and
permissible
proceeding
indeed
even
his
own
perhaps
too
complacent
consciousness
of
the
agreeable
improvement
in
his
appearance
might
have
been
forgiven
in
such
circumstances
seeing
that
pyotr
petrovitch
had
taken
up
the
r
le
of
fianc
all
his
clothes
were
fresh
from
the
tailor
s
and
were
all
right
except
for
being
too
new
and
too
distinctly
appropriate
even
the
stylish
new
round
hat
had
the
same
significance
pyotr
petrovitch
treated
it
too
respectfully
and
held
it
too
carefully
in
his
hands
the
exquisite
pair
of
lavender
gloves
real
louvain
told
the
same
tale
if
only
from
the
fact
of
his
not
wearing
them
but
carrying
them
in
his
hand
for
show
light
and
youthful
colours
predominated
in
pyotr
petrovitch
s
attire
he
wore
a
charming
summer
jacket
of
a
fawn
shade
light
thin
trousers
a
waistcoat
of
the
same
new
and
fine
linen
a
cravat
of
the
lightest
cambric
with
pink
stripes
on
it
and
the
best
of
it
was
this
all
suited
pyotr
petrovitch
his
very
fresh
and
even
handsome
face
looked
younger
than
his
forty
five
years
at
all
times
his
dark
mutton
chop
whiskers
made
an
agreeable
setting
on
both
sides
growing
thickly
upon
his
shining
clean
shaven
chin
even
his
hair
touched
here
and
there
with
grey
though
it
had
been
combed
and
curled
at
a
hairdresser
s
did
not
give
him
a
stupid
appearance
as
curled
hair
usually
does
by
inevitably
suggesting
a
german
on
his
wedding
day
if
there
really
was
something
unpleasing
and
repulsive
in
his
rather
good
looking
and
imposing
countenance
it
was
due
to
quite
other
causes
after
scanning
mr
luzhin
unceremoniously
raskolnikov
smiled
malignantly
sank
back
on
the
pillow
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
as
before
but
mr
luzhin
hardened
his
heart
and
seemed
to
determine
to
take
no
notice
of
their
oddities
i
feel
the
greatest
regret
at
finding
you
in
this
situation
he
began
again
breaking
the
silence
with
an
effort
if
i
had
been
aware
of
your
illness
i
should
have
come
earlier
but
you
know
what
business
is
i
have
too
a
very
important
legal
affair
in
the
senate
not
to
mention
other
preoccupations
which
you
may
well
conjecture
i
am
expecting
your
mamma
and
sister
any
minute
raskolnikov
made
a
movement
and
seemed
about
to
speak
his
face
showed
some
excitement
pyotr
petrovitch
paused
waited
but
as
nothing
followed
he
went
on
any
minute
i
have
found
a
lodging
for
them
on
their
arrival
where
asked
raskolnikov
weakly
very
near
here
in
bakaleyev
s
house
that
s
in
voskresensky
put
in
razumihin
there
are
two
storeys
of
rooms
let
by
a
merchant
called
yushin
i
ve
been
there
yes
rooms
a
disgusting
place
filthy
stinking
and
what
s
more
of
doubtful
character
things
have
happened
there
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
queer
people
living
there
and
i
went
there
about
a
scandalous
business
it
s
cheap
though
i
could
not
of
course
find
out
so
much
about
it
for
i
am
a
stranger
in
petersburg
myself
pyotr
petrovitch
replied
huffily
however
the
two
rooms
are
exceedingly
clean
and
as
it
is
for
so
short
a
time
i
have
already
taken
a
permanent
that
is
our
future
flat
he
said
addressing
raskolnikov
and
i
am
having
it
done
up
and
meanwhile
i
am
myself
cramped
for
room
in
a
lodging
with
my
friend
andrey
semyonovitch
lebeziatnikov
in
the
flat
of
madame
lippevechsel
it
was
he
who
told
me
of
bakaleyev
s
house
too
lebeziatnikov
said
raskolnikov
slowly
as
if
recalling
something
yes
andrey
semyonovitch
lebeziatnikov
a
clerk
in
the
ministry
do
you
know
him
yes
no
raskolnikov
answered
excuse
me
i
fancied
so
from
your
inquiry
i
was
once
his
guardian
a
very
nice
young
man
and
advanced
i
like
to
meet
young
people
one
learns
new
things
from
them
luzhin
looked
round
hopefully
at
them
all
how
do
you
mean
asked
razumihin
in
the
most
serious
and
essential
matters
pyotr
petrovitch
replied
as
though
delighted
at
the
question
you
see
it
s
ten
years
since
i
visited
petersburg
all
the
novelties
reforms
ideas
have
reached
us
in
the
provinces
but
to
see
it
all
more
clearly
one
must
be
in
petersburg
and
it
s
my
notion
that
you
observe
and
learn
most
by
watching
the
younger
generation
and
i
confess
i
am
delighted
at
what
your
question
is
a
wide
one
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
fancy
i
find
clearer
views
more
so
to
say
criticism
more
practicality
that
s
true
zossimov
let
drop
nonsense
there
s
no
practicality
razumihin
flew
at
him
practicality
is
a
difficult
thing
to
find
it
does
not
drop
down
from
heaven
and
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
we
have
been
divorced
from
all
practical
life
ideas
if
you
like
are
fermenting
he
said
to
pyotr
petrovitch
and
desire
for
good
exists
though
it
s
in
a
childish
form
and
honesty
you
may
find
although
there
are
crowds
of
brigands
anyway
there
s
no
practicality
practicality
goes
well
shod
i
don
t
agree
with
you
pyotr
petrovitch
replied
with
evident
enjoyment
of
course
people
do
get
carried
away
and
make
mistakes
but
one
must
have
indulgence
those
mistakes
are
merely
evidence
of
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
and
of
abnormal
external
environment
if
little
has
been
done
the
time
has
been
but
short
of
means
i
will
not
speak
it
s
my
personal
view
if
you
care
to
know
that
something
has
been
accomplished
already
new
valuable
ideas
new
valuable
works
are
circulating
in
the
place
of
our
old
dreamy
and
romantic
authors
literature
is
taking
a
maturer
form
many
injurious
prejudices
have
been
rooted
up
and
turned
into
ridicule
in
a
word
we
have
cut
ourselves
off
irrevocably
from
the
past
and
that
to
my
thinking
is
a
great
thing
he
s
learnt
it
by
heart
to
show
off
raskolnikov
pronounced
suddenly
what
asked
pyotr
petrovitch
not
catching
his
words
but
he
received
no
reply
that
s
all
true
zossimov
hastened
to
interpose
isn
t
it
so
pyotr
petrovitch
went
on
glancing
affably
at
zossimov
you
must
admit
he
went
on
addressing
razumihin
with
a
shade
of
triumph
and
superciliousness
he
almost
added
young
man
that
there
is
an
advance
or
as
they
say
now
progress
in
the
name
of
science
and
economic
truth
a
commonplace
no
not
a
commonplace
hitherto
for
instance
if
i
were
told
love
thy
neighbour
what
came
of
it
pyotr
petrovitch
went
on
perhaps
with
excessive
haste
it
came
to
my
tearing
my
coat
in
half
to
share
with
my
neighbour
and
we
both
were
left
half
naked
as
a
russian
proverb
has
it
catch
several
hares
and
you
won
t
catch
one
science
now
tells
us
love
yourself
before
all
men
for
everything
in
the
world
rests
on
self
interest
you
love
yourself
and
manage
your
own
affairs
properly
and
your
coat
remains
whole
economic
truth
adds
that
the
better
private
affairs
are
organised
in
society
the
more
whole
coats
so
to
say
the
firmer
are
its
foundations
and
the
better
is
the
common
welfare
organised
too
therefore
in
acquiring
wealth
solely
and
exclusively
for
myself
i
am
acquiring
so
to
speak
for
all
and
helping
to
bring
to
pass
my
neighbour
s
getting
a
little
more
than
a
torn
coat
and
that
not
from
private
personal
liberality
but
as
a
consequence
of
the
general
advance
the
idea
is
simple
but
unhappily
it
has
been
a
long
time
reaching
us
being
hindered
by
idealism
and
sentimentality
and
yet
it
would
seem
to
want
very
little
wit
to
perceive
it
excuse
me
i
ve
very
little
wit
myself
razumihin
cut
in
sharply
and
so
let
us
drop
it
i
began
this
discussion
with
an
object
but
i
ve
grown
so
sick
during
the
last
three
years
of
this
chattering
to
amuse
oneself
of
this
incessant
flow
of
commonplaces
always
the
same
that
by
jove
i
blush
even
when
other
people
talk
like
that
you
are
in
a
hurry
no
doubt
to
exhibit
your
acquirements
and
i
don
t
blame
you
that
s
quite
pardonable
i
only
wanted
to
find
out
what
sort
of
man
you
are
for
so
many
unscrupulous
people
have
got
hold
of
the
progressive
cause
of
late
and
have
so
distorted
in
their
own
interests
everything
they
touched
that
the
whole
cause
has
been
dragged
in
the
mire
that
s
enough
excuse
me
sir
said
luzhin
affronted
and
speaking
with
excessive
dignity
do
you
mean
to
suggest
so
unceremoniously
that
i
too
oh
my
dear
sir
how
could
i
come
that
s
enough
razumihin
concluded
and
he
turned
abruptly
to
zossimov
to
continue
their
previous
conversation
pyotr
petrovitch
had
the
good
sense
to
accept
the
disavowal
he
made
up
his
mind
to
take
leave
in
another
minute
or
two
i
trust
our
acquaintance
he
said
addressing
raskolnikov
may
upon
your
recovery
and
in
view
of
the
circumstances
of
which
you
are
aware
become
closer
above
all
i
hope
for
your
return
to
health
raskolnikov
did
not
even
turn
his
head
pyotr
petrovitch
began
getting
up
from
his
chair
one
of
her
customers
must
have
killed
her
zossimov
declared
positively
not
a
doubt
of
it
replied
razumihin
porfiry
doesn
t
give
his
opinion
but
is
examining
all
who
have
left
pledges
with
her
there
examining
them
raskolnikov
asked
aloud
yes
what
then
nothing
how
does
he
get
hold
of
them
asked
zossimov
koch
has
given
the
names
of
some
of
them
other
names
are
on
the
wrappers
of
the
pledges
and
some
have
come
forward
of
themselves
it
must
have
been
a
cunning
and
practised
ruffian
the
boldness
of
it
the
coolness
that
s
just
what
it
wasn
t
interposed
razumihin
that
s
what
throws
you
all
off
the
scent
but
i
maintain
that
he
is
not
cunning
not
practised
and
probably
this
was
his
first
crime
the
supposition
that
it
was
a
calculated
crime
and
a
cunning
criminal
doesn
t
work
suppose
him
to
have
been
inexperienced
and
it
s
clear
that
it
was
only
a
chance
that
saved
him
and
chance
may
do
anything
why
he
did
not
foresee
obstacles
perhaps
and
how
did
he
set
to
work
he
took
jewels
worth
ten
or
twenty
roubles
stuffing
his
pockets
with
them
ransacked
the
old
woman
s
trunks
her
rags
and
they
found
fifteen
hundred
roubles
besides
notes
in
a
box
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
chest
he
did
not
know
how
to
rob
he
could
only
murder
it
was
his
first
crime
i
assure
you
his
first
crime
he
lost
his
head
and
he
got
off
more
by
luck
than
good
counsel
you
are
talking
of
the
murder
of
the
old
pawnbroker
i
believe
pyotr
petrovitch
put
in
addressing
zossimov
he
was
standing
hat
and
gloves
in
hand
but
before
departing
he
felt
disposed
to
throw
off
a
few
more
intellectual
phrases
he
was
evidently
anxious
to
make
a
favourable
impression
and
his
vanity
overcame
his
prudence
yes
you
ve
heard
of
it
oh
yes
being
in
the
neighbourhood
do
you
know
the
details
i
can
t
say
that
but
another
circumstance
interests
me
in
the
case
the
whole
question
so
to
say
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
crime
has
been
greatly
on
the
increase
among
the
lower
classes
during
the
last
five
years
not
to
speak
of
the
cases
of
robbery
and
arson
everywhere
what
strikes
me
as
the
strangest
thing
is
that
in
the
higher
classes
too
crime
is
increasing
proportionately
in
one
place
one
hears
of
a
student
s
robbing
the
mail
on
the
high
road
in
another
place
people
of
good
social
position
forge
false
banknotes
in
moscow
of
late
a
whole
gang
has
been
captured
who
used
to
forge
lottery
tickets
and
one
of
the
ringleaders
was
a
lecturer
in
universal
history
then
our
secretary
abroad
was
murdered
from
some
obscure
motive
of
gain
and
if
this
old
woman
the
pawnbroker
has
been
murdered
by
someone
of
a
higher
class
in
society
for
peasants
don
t
pawn
gold
trinkets
how
are
we
to
explain
this
demoralisation
of
the
civilised
part
of
our
society
there
are
many
economic
changes
put
in
zossimov
how
are
we
to
explain
it
razumihin
caught
him
up
it
might
be
explained
by
our
inveterate
impracticality
how
do
you
mean
what
answer
had
your
lecturer
in
moscow
to
make
to
the
question
why
he
was
forging
notes
everybody
is
getting
rich
one
way
or
another
so
i
want
to
make
haste
to
get
rich
too
i
don
t
remember
the
exact
words
but
the
upshot
was
that
he
wants
money
for
nothing
without
waiting
or
working
we
ve
grown
used
to
having
everything
ready
made
to
walking
on
crutches
to
having
our
food
chewed
for
us
then
the
great
hour
struck

and
every
man
showed
himself
in
his
true
colours

the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
in
1861
is
meant
translator
s
note
but
morality
and
so
to
speak
principles
but
why
do
you
worry
about
it
raskolnikov
interposed
suddenly
it
s
in
accordance
with
your
theory
in
accordance
with
my
theory
why
carry
out
logically
the
theory
you
were
advocating
just
now
and
it
follows
that
people
may
be
killed
upon
my
word
cried
luzhin
no
that
s
not
so
put
in
zossimov
raskolnikov
lay
with
a
white
face
and
twitching
upper
lip
breathing
painfully
there
s
a
measure
in
all
things
luzhin
went
on
superciliously
economic
ideas
are
not
an
incitement
to
murder
and
one
has
but
to
suppose
and
is
it
true
raskolnikov
interposed
once
more
suddenly
again
in
a
voice
quivering
with
fury
and
delight
in
insulting
him
is
it
true
that
you
told
your
fianc
e
within
an
hour
of
her
acceptance
that
what
pleased
you
most
was
that
she
was
a
beggar
because
it
was
better
to
raise
a
wife
from
poverty
so
that
you
may
have
complete
control
over
her
and
reproach
her
with
your
being
her
benefactor
upon
my
word
luzhin
cried
wrathfully
and
irritably
crimson
with
confusion
to
distort
my
words
in
this
way
excuse
me
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
the
report
which
has
reached
you
or
rather
let
me
say
has
been
conveyed
to
you
has
no
foundation
in
truth
and
i
suspect
who
in
a
word
this
arrow
in
a
word
your
mamma
she
seemed
to
me
in
other
things
with
all
her
excellent
qualities
of
a
somewhat
high
flown
and
romantic
way
of
thinking
but
i
was
a
thousand
miles
from
supposing
that
she
would
misunderstand
and
misrepresent
things
in
so
fanciful
a
way
and
indeed
indeed
i
tell
you
what
cried
raskolnikov
raising
himself
on
his
pillow
and
fixing
his
piercing
glittering
eyes
upon
him
i
tell
you
what
what
luzhin
stood
still
waiting
with
a
defiant
and
offended
face
silence
lasted
for
some
seconds
why
if
ever
again
you
dare
to
mention
a
single
word
about
my
mother
i
shall
send
you
flying
downstairs
what
s
the
matter
with
you
cried
razumihin
so
that
s
how
it
is
luzhin
turned
pale
and
bit
his
lip
let
me
tell
you
sir
he
began
deliberately
doing
his
utmost
to
restrain
himself
but
breathing
hard
at
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
you
were
ill
disposed
to
me
but
i
remained
here
on
purpose
to
find
out
more
i
could
forgive
a
great
deal
in
a
sick
man
and
a
connection
but
you
never
after
this
i
am
not
ill
cried
raskolnikov
so
much
the
worse
go
to
hell
but
luzhin
was
already
leaving
without
finishing
his
speech
squeezing
between
the
table
and
the
chair
razumihin
got
up
this
time
to
let
him
pass
without
glancing
at
anyone
and
not
even
nodding
to
zossimov
who
had
for
some
time
been
making
signs
to
him
to
let
the
sick
man
alone
he
went
out
lifting
his
hat
to
the
level
of
his
shoulders
to
avoid
crushing
it
as
he
stooped
to
go
out
of
the
door
and
even
the
curve
of
his
spine
was
expressive
of
the
horrible
insult
he
had
received
how
could
you
how
could
you
razumihin
said
shaking
his
head
in
perplexity
let
me
alone
let
me
alone
all
of
you
raskolnikov
cried
in
a
frenzy
will
you
ever
leave
off
tormenting
me
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
i
am
not
afraid
of
anyone
anyone
now
get
away
from
me
i
want
to
be
alone
alone
alone
come
along
said
zossimov
nodding
to
razumihin
but
we
can
t
leave
him
like
this
come
along
zossimov
repeated
insistently
and
he
went
out
razumihin
thought
a
minute
and
ran
to
overtake
him
it
might
be
worse
not
to
obey
him
said
zossimov
on
the
stairs
he
mustn
t
be
irritated
what
s
the
matter
with
him
if
only
he
could
get
some
favourable
shock
that
s
what
would
do
it
at
first
he
was
better
you
know
he
has
got
something
on
his
mind
some
fixed
idea
weighing
on
him
i
am
very
much
afraid
so
he
must
have
perhaps
it
s
that
gentleman
pyotr
petrovitch
from
his
conversation
i
gather
he
is
going
to
marry
his
sister
and
that
he
had
received
a
letter
about
it
just
before
his
illness
yes
confound
the
man
he
may
have
upset
the
case
altogether
but
have
you
noticed
he
takes
no
interest
in
anything
he
does
not
respond
to
anything
except
one
point
on
which
he
seems
excited
that
s
the
murder
yes
yes
razumihin
agreed
i
noticed
that
too
he
is
interested
frightened
it
gave
him
a
shock
on
the
day
he
was
ill
in
the
police
office
he
fainted
tell
me
more
about
that
this
evening
and
i
ll
tell
you
something
afterwards
he
interests
me
very
much
in
half
an
hour
i
ll
go
and
see
him
again
there
ll
be
no
inflammation
though
thanks
and
i
ll
wait
with
pashenka
meantime
and
will
keep
watch
on
him
through
nastasya
raskolnikov
left
alone
looked
with
impatience
and
misery
at
nastasya
but
she
still
lingered
won
t
you
have
some
tea
now
she
asked
later
i
am
sleepy
leave
me
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
wall
nastasya
went
out
chapter
vi
but
as
soon
as
she
went
out
he
got
up
latched
the
door
undid
the
parcel
which
razumihin
had
brought
in
that
evening
and
had
tied
up
again
and
began
dressing
strange
to
say
he
seemed
immediately
to
have
become
perfectly
calm
not
a
trace
of
his
recent
delirium
nor
of
the
panic
fear
that
had
haunted
him
of
late
it
was
the
first
moment
of
a
strange
sudden
calm
his
movements
were
precise
and
definite
a
firm
purpose
was
evident
in
them
to
day
to
day
he
muttered
to
himself
he
understood
that
he
was
still
weak
but
his
intense
spiritual
concentration
gave
him
strength
and
self
confidence
he
hoped
moreover
that
he
would
not
fall
down
in
the
street
when
he
had
dressed
in
entirely
new
clothes
he
looked
at
the
money
lying
on
the
table
and
after
a
moment
s
thought
put
it
in
his
pocket
it
was
twenty
five
roubles
he
took
also
all
the
copper
change
from
the
ten
roubles
spent
by
razumihin
on
the
clothes
then
he
softly
unlatched
the
door
went
out
slipped
downstairs
and
glanced
in
at
the
open
kitchen
door
nastasya
was
standing
with
her
back
to
him
blowing
up
the
landlady
s
samovar
she
heard
nothing
who
would
have
dreamed
of
his
going
out
indeed
a
minute
later
he
was
in
the
street
it
was
nearly
eight
o
clock
the
sun
was
setting
it
was
as
stifling
as
before
but
he
eagerly
drank
in
the
stinking
dusty
town
air
his
head
felt
rather
dizzy
a
sort
of
savage
energy
gleamed
suddenly
in
his
feverish
eyes
and
his
wasted
pale
and
yellow
face
he
did
not
know
and
did
not
think
where
he
was
going
he
had
one
thought
only
that
all
this
must
be
ended
to
day
once
for
all
immediately
that
he
would
not
return
home
without
it
because
he
would
not
go
on
living
like
that
how
with
what
to
make
an
end
he
had
not
an
idea
about
it
he
did
not
even
want
to
think
of
it
he
drove
away
thought
thought
tortured
him
all
he
knew
all
he
felt
was
that
everything
must
be
changed
one
way
or
another
he
repeated
with
desperate
and
immovable
self
confidence
and
determination
from
old
habit
he
took
his
usual
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
hay
market
a
dark
haired
young
man
with
a
barrel
organ
was
standing
in
the
road
in
front
of
a
little
general
shop
and
was
grinding
out
a
very
sentimental
song
he
was
accompanying
a
girl
of
fifteen
who
stood
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
him
she
was
dressed
up
in
a
crinoline
a
mantle
and
a
straw
hat
with
a
flame
coloured
feather
in
it
all
very
old
and
shabby
in
a
strong
and
rather
agreeable
voice
cracked
and
coarsened
by
street
singing
she
sang
in
hope
of
getting
a
copper
from
the
shop
raskolnikov
joined
two
or
three
listeners
took
out
a
five
copeck
piece
and
put
it
in
the
girl
s
hand
she
broke
off
abruptly
on
a
sentimental
high
note
shouted
sharply
to
the
organ
grinder
come
on
and
both
moved
on
to
the
next
shop
do
you
like
street
music
said
raskolnikov
addressing
a
middle
aged
man
standing
idly
by
him
the
man
looked
at
him
startled
and
wondering
i
love
to
hear
singing
to
a
street
organ
said
raskolnikov
and
his
manner
seemed
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
the
subject
i
like
it
on
cold
dark
damp
autumn
evenings
they
must
be
damp
when
all
the
passers
by
have
pale
green
sickly
faces
or
better
still
when
wet
snow
is
falling
straight
down
when
there
s
no
wind
you
know
what
i
mean
and
the
street
lamps
shine
through
it
i
don
t
know
excuse
me
muttered
the
stranger
frightened
by
the
question
and
raskolnikov
s
strange
manner
and
he
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
raskolnikov
walked
straight
on
and
came
out
at
the
corner
of
the
hay
market
where
the
huckster
and
his
wife
had
talked
with
lizaveta
but
they
were
not
there
now
recognising
the
place
he
stopped
looked
round
and
addressed
a
young
fellow
in
a
red
shirt
who
stood
gaping
before
a
corn
chandler
s
shop
isn
t
there
a
man
who
keeps
a
booth
with
his
wife
at
this
corner
all
sorts
of
people
keep
booths
here
answered
the
young
man
glancing
superciliously
at
raskolnikov
what
s
his
name
what
he
was
christened
aren
t
you
a
zara
sky
man
too
which
province
the
young
man
looked
at
raskolnikov
again
it
s
not
a
province
your
excellency
but
a
district
graciously
forgive
me
your
excellency
is
that
a
tavern
at
the
top
there
yes
it
s
an
eating
house
and
there
s
a
billiard
room
and
you
ll
find
princesses
there
too
la
la
raskolnikov
crossed
the
square
in
that
corner
there
was
a
dense
crowd
of
peasants
he
pushed
his
way
into
the
thickest
part
of
it
looking
at
the
faces
he
felt
an
unaccountable
inclination
to
enter
into
conversation
with
people
but
the
peasants
took
no
notice
of
him
they
were
all
shouting
in
groups
together
he
stood
and
thought
a
little
and
took
a
turning
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
v
he
had
often
crossed
that
little
street
which
turns
at
an
angle
leading
from
the
market
place
to
sadovy
street
of
late
he
had
often
felt
drawn
to
wander
about
this
district
when
he
felt
depressed
that
he
might
feel
more
so
now
he
walked
along
thinking
of
nothing
at
that
point
there
is
a
great
block
of
buildings
entirely
let
out
in
dram
shops
and
eating
houses
women
were
continually
running
in
and
out
bare
headed
and
in
their
indoor
clothes
here
and
there
they
gathered
in
groups
on
the
pavement
especially
about
the
entrances
to
various
festive
establishments
in
the
lower
storeys
from
one
of
these
a
loud
din
sounds
of
singing
the
tinkling
of
a
guitar
and
shouts
of
merriment
floated
into
the
street
a
crowd
of
women
were
thronging
round
the
door
some
were
sitting
on
the
steps
others
on
the
pavement
others
were
standing
talking
a
drunken
soldier
smoking
a
cigarette
was
walking
near
them
in
the
road
swearing
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
find
his
way
somewhere
but
had
forgotten
where
one
beggar
was
quarrelling
with
another
and
a
man
dead
drunk
was
lying
right
across
the
road
raskolnikov
joined
the
throng
of
women
who
were
talking
in
husky
voices
they
were
bare
headed
and
wore
cotton
dresses
and
goatskin
shoes
there
were
women
of
forty
and
some
not
more
than
seventeen
almost
all
had
blackened
eyes
he
felt
strangely
attracted
by
the
singing
and
all
the
noise
and
uproar
in
the
saloon
below
someone
could
be
heard
within
dancing
frantically
marking
time
with
his
heels
to
the
sounds
of
the
guitar
and
of
a
thin
falsetto
voice
singing
a
jaunty
air
he
listened
intently
gloomily
and
dreamily
bending
down
at
the
entrance
and
peeping
inquisitively
in
from
the
pavement
oh
my
handsome
soldier
don
t
beat
me
for
nothing
trilled
the
thin
voice
of
the
singer
raskolnikov
felt
a
great
desire
to
make
out
what
he
was
singing
as
though
everything
depended
on
that
shall
i
go
in
he
thought
they
are
laughing
from
drink
shall
i
get
drunk
won
t
you
come
in
one
of
the
women
asked
him
her
voice
was
still
musical
and
less
thick
than
the
others
she
was
young
and
not
repulsive
the
only
one
of
the
group
why
she
s
pretty
he
said
drawing
himself
up
and
looking
at
her
she
smiled
much
pleased
at
the
compliment
you
re
very
nice
looking
yourself
she
said
isn
t
he
thin
though
observed
another
woman
in
a
deep
bass
have
you
just
come
out
of
a
hospital
they
re
all
generals
daughters
it
seems
but
they
have
all
snub
noses
interposed
a
tipsy
peasant
with
a
sly
smile
on
his
face
wearing
a
loose
coat
see
how
jolly
they
are
go
along
with
you
i
ll
go
sweetie
and
he
darted
down
into
the
saloon
below
raskolnikov
moved
on
i
say
sir
the
girl
shouted
after
him
what
is
it
she
hesitated
i
ll
always
be
pleased
to
spend
an
hour
with
you
kind
gentleman
but
now
i
feel
shy
give
me
six
copecks
for
a
drink
there
s
a
nice
young
man
raskolnikov
gave
her
what
came
first
fifteen
copecks
ah
what
a
good
natured
gentleman
what
s
your
name
ask
for
duclida
well
that
s
too
much
one
of
the
women
observed
shaking
her
head
at
duclida
i
don
t
know
how
you
can
ask
like
that
i
believe
i
should
drop
with
shame
raskolnikov
looked
curiously
at
the
speaker
she
was
a
pock
marked
wench
of
thirty
covered
with
bruises
with
her
upper
lip
swollen
she
made
her
criticism
quietly
and
earnestly
where
is
it
thought
raskolnikov
where
is
it
i
ve
read
that
someone
condemned
to
death
says
or
thinks
an
hour
before
his
death
that
if
he
had
to
live
on
some
high
rock
on
such
a
narrow
ledge
that
he
d
only
room
to
stand
and
the
ocean
everlasting
darkness
everlasting
solitude
everlasting
tempest
around
him
if
he
had
to
remain
standing
on
a
square
yard
of
space
all
his
life
a
thousand
years
eternity
it
were
better
to
live
so
than
to
die
at
once
only
to
live
to
live
and
live
life
whatever
it
may
be
how
true
it
is
good
god
how
true
man
is
a
vile
creature
and
vile
is
he
who
calls
him
vile
for
that
he
added
a
moment
later
he
went
into
another
street
bah
the
palais
de
cristal
razumihin
was
just
talking
of
the
palais
de
cristal
but
what
on
earth
was
it
i
wanted
yes
the
newspapers
zossimov
said
he
d
read
it
in
the
papers
have
you
the
papers
he
asked
going
into
a
very
spacious
and
positively
clean
restaurant
consisting
of
several
rooms
which
were
however
rather
empty
two
or
three
people
were
drinking
tea
and
in
a
room
further
away
were
sitting
four
men
drinking
champagne
raskolnikov
fancied
that
zametov
was
one
of
them
but
he
could
not
be
sure
at
that
distance
what
if
it
is
he
thought
will
you
have
vodka
asked
the
waiter
give
me
some
tea
and
bring
me
the
papers
the
old
ones
for
the
last
five
days
and
i
ll
give
you
something
yes
sir
here
s
to
day
s
no
vodka
the
old
newspapers
and
the
tea
were
brought
raskolnikov
sat
down
and
began
to
look
through
them
oh
damn
these
are
the
items
of
intelligence
an
accident
on
a
staircase
spontaneous
combustion
of
a
shopkeeper
from
alcohol
a
fire
in
peski
a
fire
in
the
petersburg
quarter
another
fire
in
the
petersburg
quarter
and
another
fire
in
the
petersburg
quarter
ah
here
it
is
he
found
at
last
what
he
was
seeking
and
began
to
read
it
the
lines
danced
before
his
eyes
but
he
read
it
all
and
began
eagerly
seeking
later
additions
in
the
following
numbers
his
hands
shook
with
nervous
impatience
as
he
turned
the
sheets
suddenly
someone
sat
down
beside
him
at
his
table
he
looked
up
it
was
the
head
clerk
zametov
looking
just
the
same
with
the
rings
on
his
fingers
and
the
watch
chain
with
the
curly
black
hair
parted
and
pomaded
with
the
smart
waistcoat
rather
shabby
coat
and
doubtful
linen
he
was
in
a
good
humour
at
least
he
was
smiling
very
gaily
and
good
humouredly
his
dark
face
was
rather
flushed
from
the
champagne
he
had
drunk
what
you
here
he
began
in
surprise
speaking
as
though
he
d
known
him
all
his
life
why
razumihin
told
me
only
yesterday
you
were
unconscious
how
strange
and
do
you
know
i
ve
been
to
see
you
raskolnikov
knew
he
would
come
up
to
him
he
laid
aside
the
papers
and
turned
to
zametov
there
was
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
new
shade
of
irritable
impatience
was
apparent
in
that
smile
i
know
you
have
he
answered
i
ve
heard
it
you
looked
for
my
sock
and
you
know
razumihin
has
lost
his
heart
to
you
he
says
you
ve
been
with
him
to
luise
ivanovna
s
you
know
the
woman
you
tried
to
befriend
for
whom
you
winked
to
the
explosive
lieutenant
and
he
would
not
understand
do
you
remember
how
could
he
fail
to
understand
it
was
quite
clear
wasn
t
it
what
a
hot
head
he
is
the
explosive
one
no
your
friend
razumihin
you
must
have
a
jolly
life
mr
zametov
entrance
free
to
the
most
agreeable
places
who
s
been
pouring
champagne
into
you
just
now
we
ve
just
been
having
a
drink
together
you
talk
about
pouring
it
into
me
by
way
of
a
fee
you
profit
by
everything
raskolnikov
laughed
it
s
all
right
my
dear
boy
he
added
slapping
zametov
on
the
shoulder
i
am
not
speaking
from
temper
but
in
a
friendly
way
for
sport
as
that
workman
of
yours
said
when
he
was
scuffling
with
dmitri
in
the
case
of
the
old
woman
how
do
you
know
about
it
perhaps
i
know
more
about
it
than
you
do
how
strange
you
are
i
am
sure
you
are
still
very
unwell
you
oughtn
t
to
have
come
out
oh

i
seem
strange

reading
the
papers

a
lot
about
the
fires
no
i
am
not
reading
about
the
fires
here
he
looked
mysteriously
at
zametov
his
lips
were
twisted
again
in
a
mocking
smile
no
i
am
not
reading
about
the
fires
he
went
on
winking
at
zametov
but
confess
now
my
dear
fellow
you
re
awfully
anxious
to
know
what
i
am
reading
about
i
am
not
in
the
least
mayn
t
i
ask
a
question
why
do
you
keep
on
listen
you
are
a
man
of
culture
and
education
i
was
in
the
sixth
class
at
the
gymnasium

zametov
with
some
dignity
sixth
class

cock
sparrow
with
your
parting
and
your
rings
you
are
a
gentleman
of
fortune
foo
what
a
charming
boy
here
raskolnikov
broke
into
a
nervous
laugh
right
in
zametov
s
face
the
latter
drew
back
more
amazed
than
offended
foo
how
strange
you
are
zametov

very
seriously
i
can
t
help
thinking

delirious

i
confess
no
that
s
not
right
either
i
make
a
deposition
and
you
take
it
i
depose
that
i
was
reading
that
i
was
looking
and
searching
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
paused
i
was
searching
and
came
here
on
purpose
to
do
it
for
news
of
the
murder
of
the
old
pawnbroker
woman
he
articulated
at
last
almost
in
a
whisper
bringing
his
face
exceedingly
close
to
the
face
of
zametov
zametov
looked
at
him
steadily
without
moving
or
drawing
his
face
away
what
struck
zametov
afterwards
as
the
strangest
part
of
it
all
was
that
silence
followed
for
exactly
a
minute
and
that
they
gazed
at
one
another
all
the
while
what
if
you
have
been
reading
about
it
he
cried
at
last
perplexed
and
impatient
that
s
no
business
of
mine
what
of
it
the
same
old
woman
raskolnikov
went
on
in
the
same
whisper
not
heeding
zametov
s
explanation
about
whom
you
were
talking
in
the
police
office
you
remember
when
i
fainted
well
do
you
understand
now
what
do
you
mean
understand
what
zametov
brought
out
almost
alarmed
raskolnikov
s
set
and
earnest
face
was
suddenly
transformed
and
he
suddenly
went
off
into
the
same
nervous
laugh
as
before
as
though
utterly
unable
to
restrain
himself
and
in
one
flash
he
recalled
with
extraordinary
vividness
of
sensation
a
moment
in
the
recent
past
that
moment
when
he
stood
with
the
axe
behind
the
door
while
the
latch
trembled
and
the
men
outside
swore
and
shook
it
and
he
had
a
sudden
desire
to
shout
at
them
to
swear
at
them
to
put
out
his
tongue
at
them
to
mock
them
to
laugh
and
laugh
and
laugh
you
are
either
mad
or
began
zametov
and
he
broke
off
as
though
stunned
by
the
idea
that
had
suddenly
flashed
into
his
mind
or
or
what
what
come
tell
me
nothing
said
zametov
getting
angry
it
s
all
nonsense
both
were
silent
after
his
sudden
fit
of
laughter
raskolnikov
became
suddenly
thoughtful
and
melancholy
he
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
he
seemed
to
have
completely
forgotten
zametov
the
silence
lasted
for
some
time
why
don
t
you
drink
your
tea
it
s
getting
cold
said
zametov
what
tea
oh
yes
raskolnikov
sipped
the
glass
put
a
morsel
of
bread
in
his
mouth
and
suddenly
looking
at
zametov
seemed
to
remember
everything
and
pulled
himself
together
at
the
same
moment
his
face
resumed
its
original
mocking
expression
he
went
on
drinking
tea
there
have
been
a
great
many
of
these
crimes
lately
said
zametov
only
the
other
day
i
read
in
the
moscow
news
that
a
whole
gang
of
false
coiners
had
been
caught
in
moscow
it
was
a
regular
society
they
used
to
forge
tickets
oh
but
it
was
a
long
time
ago
i
read
about
it
a
month
ago
raskolnikov
answered
calmly
so
you
consider
them
criminals
he
added
smiling
of
course
they
are
criminals
they
they
are
children
simpletons
not
criminals
why
half
a
hundred
people
meeting
for
such
an
object
what
an
idea
three
would
be
too
many
and
then
they
want
to
have
more
faith
in
one
another
than
in
themselves
one
has
only
to
blab
in
his
cups
and
it
all
collapses
simpletons
they
engaged
untrustworthy
people
to
change
the
notes
what
a
thing
to
trust
to
a
casual
stranger
well
let
us
suppose
that
these
simpletons
succeed
and
each
makes
a
million
and
what
follows
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
each
is
dependent
on
the
others
for
the
rest
of
his
life
better
hang
oneself
at
once
and
they
did
not
know
how
to
change
the
notes
either
the
man
who
changed
the
notes
took
five
thousand
roubles
and
his
hands
trembled
he
counted
the
first
four
thousand
but
did
not
count
the
fifth
thousand
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
the
money
into
his
pocket
and
run
away
of
course
he
roused
suspicion
and
the
whole
thing
came
to
a
crash
through
one
fool
is
it
possible
that
his
hands
trembled
observed
zametov
yes
that
s
quite
possible
that
i
feel
quite
sure
is
possible
sometimes
one
can
t
stand
things
can
t
stand
that
why
could
you
stand
it
then
no
i
couldn
t
for
the
sake
of
a
hundred
roubles
to
face
such
a
terrible
experience
to
go
with
false
notes
into
a
bank
where
it
s
their
business
to
spot
that
sort
of
thing
no
i
should
not
have
the
face
to
do
it
would
you
raskolnikov
had
an
intense
desire
again
to
put
his
tongue
out
shivers
kept
running
down
his
spine
i
should
do
it
quite
differently
raskolnikov
began
this
is
how
i
would
change
the
notes
i
d
count
the
first
thousand
three
or
four
times
backwards
and
forwards
looking
at
every
note
and
then
i
d
set
to
the
second
thousand
i
d
count
that
half
way
through
and
then
hold
some
fifty
rouble
note
to
the
light
then
turn
it
then
hold
it
to
the
light
again
to
see
whether
it
was
a
good
one
i
am
afraid
i
would
say
a
relation
of
mine
lost
twenty
five
roubles
the
other
day
through
a
false
note
and
then
i
d
tell
them
the
whole
story
and
after
i
began
counting
the
third
no
excuse
me
i
would
say
i
fancy
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
seventh
hundred
in
that
second
thousand
i
am
not
sure
and
so
i
would
give
up
the
third
thousand
and
go
back
to
the
second
and
so
on
to
the
end
and
when
i
had
finished
i
d
pick
out
one
from
the
fifth
and
one
from
the
second
thousand
and
take
them
again
to
the
light
and
ask
again
change
them
please
and
put
the
clerk
into
such
a
stew
that
he
would
not
know
how
to
get
rid
of
me
when
i
d
finished
and
had
gone
out
i
d
come
back
no
excuse
me
and
ask
for
some
explanation
that
s
how
i
d
do
it
foo
what
terrible
things
you
say
said
zametov
laughing
but
all
that
is
only
talk
i
dare
say
when
it
came
to
deeds
you
d
make
a
slip
i
believe
that
even
a
practised
desperate
man
cannot
always
reckon
on
himself
much
less
you
and
i
to
take
an
example
near
home
that
old
woman
murdered
in
our
district
the
murderer
seems
to
have
been
a
desperate
fellow
he
risked
everything
in
open
daylight
was
saved
by
a
miracle
but
his
hands
shook
too
he
did
not
succeed
in
robbing
the
place
he
couldn
t
stand
it
that
was
clear
from
the
raskolnikov
seemed
offended
clear
why
don
t
you
catch
him
then
he
cried
maliciously
gibing
at
zametov
well
they
will
catch
him
who
you
do
you
suppose
you
could
catch
him
you
ve
a
tough
job
a
great
point
for
you
is
whether
a
man
is
spending
money
or
not
if
he
had
no
money
and
suddenly
begins
spending
he
must
be
the
man
so
that
any
child
can
mislead
you
the
fact
is
they
always
do
that
though
answered
zametov
a
man
will
commit
a
clever
murder
at
the
risk
of
his
life
and
then
at
once
he
goes
drinking
in
a
tavern
they
are
caught
spending
money
they
are
not
all
as
cunning
as
you
are
you
wouldn
t
go
to
a
tavern
of
course
raskolnikov
frowned
and
looked
steadily
at
zametov
you
seem
to
enjoy
the
subject
and
would
like
to
know
how
i
should
behave
in
that
case
too
he
asked
with
displeasure
i
should
like
to
zametov
answered
firmly
and
seriously
somewhat
too
much
earnestness
began
to
appear
in
his
words
and
looks
very
much
very
much
all
right
then
this
is
how
i
should
behave
raskolnikov
began
again
bringing
his
face
close
to
zametov
s
again
staring
at
him
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
so
that
the
latter
positively
shuddered
this
is
what
i
should
have
done
i
should
have
taken
the
money
and
jewels
i
should
have
walked
out
of
there
and
have
gone
straight
to
some
deserted
place
with
fences
round
it
and
scarcely
anyone
to
be
seen
some
kitchen
garden
or
place
of
that
sort
i
should
have
looked
out
beforehand
some
stone
weighing
a
hundredweight
or
more
which
had
been
lying
in
the
corner
from
the
time
the
house
was
built
i
would
lift
that
stone
there
would
sure
to
be
a
hollow
under
it
and
i
would
put
the
jewels
and
money
in
that
hole
then
i
d
roll
the
stone
back
so
that
it
would
look
as
before
would
press
it
down
with
my
foot
and
walk
away
and
for
a
year
or
two
three
maybe
i
would
not
touch
it
and
well
they
could
search
there
d
be
no
trace
you
are
a
madman
said
zametov
and
for
some
reason
he
too
spoke
in
a
whisper
and
moved
away
from
raskolnikov
whose
eyes
were
glittering
he
had
turned
fearfully
pale
and
his
upper
lip
was
twitching
and
quivering
he
bent
down
as
close
as
possible
to
zametov
and
his
lips
began
to
move
without
uttering
a
word
this
lasted
for
half
a
minute
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
but
could
not
restrain
himself
the
terrible
word
trembled
on
his
lips
like
the
latch
on
that
door
in
another
moment
it
will
break
out
in
another
moment
he
will
let
it
go
he
will
speak
out
and
what
if
it
was
i
who
murdered
the
old
woman
and
lizaveta
he
said
suddenly
and
realised
what
he
had
done
zametov
looked
wildly
at
him
and
turned
white
as
the
tablecloth
his
face
wore
a
contorted
smile
but
is
it
possible
he
brought
out
faintly
raskolnikov
looked
wrathfully
at
him
own
up
that
you
believed
it
yes
you
did
not
a
bit
of
it
i
believe
it
less
than
ever
now
zametov
cried
hastily
i
ve
caught
my
cock
sparrow
so
you
did
believe
it
before
if
now
you
believe
less
than
ever
not
at
all
cried
zametov
obviously
embarrassed
have
you
been
frightening
me
so
as
to
lead
up
to
this
you
don
t
believe
it
then
what
were
you
talking
about
behind
my
back
when
i
went
out
of
the
police
office
and
why
did
the
explosive
lieutenant
question
me
after
i
fainted
hey
there
he
shouted
to
the
waiter
getting
up
and
taking
his
cap
how
much
thirty
copecks
the
latter
replied
running
up
and
there
is
twenty
copecks
for
vodka
see
what
a
lot
of
money
he
held
out
his
shaking
hand
to
zametov
with
notes
in
it
red
notes
and
blue
twenty
five
roubles
where
did
i
get
them
and
where
did
my
new
clothes
come
from
you
know
i
had
not
a
copeck
you
ve
cross
examined
my
landlady
i
ll
be
bound
well
that
s
enough
assez
caus
till
we
meet
again
he
went
out
trembling
all
over
from
a
sort
of
wild
hysterical
sensation
in
which
there
was
an
element
of
insufferable
rapture
yet
he
was
gloomy
and
terribly
tired
his
face
was
twisted
as
after
a
fit
his
fatigue
increased
rapidly
any
shock
any
irritating
sensation
stimulated
and
revived
his
energies
at
once
but
his
strength
failed
as
quickly
when
the
stimulus
was
removed
zametov
left
alone
sat
for
a
long
time
in
the
same
place
plunged
in
thought
raskolnikov
had
unwittingly
worked
a
revolution
in
his
brain
on
a
certain
point
and
had
made
up
his
mind
for
him
conclusively
ilya
petrovitch
is
a
blockhead
he
decided
raskolnikov
had
hardly
opened
the
door
of
the
restaurant
when
he
stumbled
against
razumihin
on
the
steps
they
did
not
see
each
other
till
they
almost
knocked
against
each
other
for
a
moment
they
stood
looking
each
other
up
and
down
razumihin
was
greatly
astounded
then
anger
real
anger
gleamed
fiercely
in
his
eyes
so
here
you
are
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
you
ran
away
from
your
bed
and
here
i
ve
been
looking
for
you
under
the
sofa
we
went
up
to
the
garret
i
almost
beat
nastasya
on
your
account
and
here
he
is
after
all
rodya
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
tell
me
the
whole
truth
confess
do
you
hear
it
means
that
i
m
sick
to
death
of
you
all
and
i
want
to
be
alone
raskolnikov
answered
calmly
alone
when
you
are
not
able
to
walk
when
your
face
is
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
you
are
gasping
for
breath
idiot
what
have
you
been
doing
in
the
palais
de
cristal
own
up
at
once
let
me
go
said
raskolnikov
and
tried
to
pass
him
this
was
too
much
for
razumihin
he
gripped
him
firmly
by
the
shoulder
let
you
go
you
dare
tell
me
to
let
you
go
do
you
know
what
i
ll
do
with
you
directly
i
ll
pick
you
up
tie
you
up
in
a
bundle
carry
you
home
under
my
arm
and
lock
you
up
listen
razumihin
raskolnikov
began
quietly
apparently
calm
can
t
you
see
that
i
don
t
want
your
benevolence
a
strange
desire
you
have
to
shower
benefits
on
a
man
who
curses
them
who
feels
them
a
burden
in
fact
why
did
you
seek
me
out
at
the
beginning
of
my
illness
maybe
i
was
very
glad
to
die
didn
t
i
tell
you
plainly
enough
to
day
that
you
were
torturing
me
that
i
was
sick
of
you
you
seem
to
want
to
torture
people
i
assure
you
that
all
that
is
seriously
hindering
my
recovery
because
it
s
continually
irritating
me
you
saw
zossimov
went
away
just
now
to
avoid
irritating
me
you
leave
me
alone
too
for
goodness
sake
what
right
have
you
indeed
to
keep
me
by
force
don
t
you
see
that
i
am
in
possession
of
all
my
faculties
now
how
how
can
i
persuade
you
not
to
persecute
me
with
your
kindness
i
may
be
ungrateful
i
may
be
mean
only
let
me
be
for
god
s
sake
let
me
be
let
me
be
let
me
be
he
began
calmly
gloating
beforehand
over
the
venomous
phrases
he
was
about
to
utter
but
finished
panting
for
breath
in
a
frenzy
as
he
had
been
with
luzhin
razumihin
stood
a
moment
thought
and
let
his
hand
drop
well
go
to
hell
then
he
said
gently
and
thoughtfully
stay
he
roared
as
raskolnikov
was
about
to
move
listen
to
me
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
all
a
set
of
babbling
posing
idiots
if
you
ve
any
little
trouble
you
brood
over
it
like
a
hen
over
an
egg
and
you
are
plagiarists
even
in
that
there
isn
t
a
sign
of
independent
life
in
you
you
are
made
of
spermaceti
ointment
and
you
ve
lymph
in
your
veins
instead
of
blood
i
don
t
believe
in
anyone
of
you
in
any
circumstances
the
first
thing
for
all
of
you
is
to
be
unlike
a
human
being
stop
he
cried
with
redoubled
fury
noticing
that
raskolnikov
was
again
making
a
movement
hear
me
out
you
know
i
m
having
a
house
warming
this
evening
i
dare
say
they
ve
arrived
by
now
but
i
left
my
uncle
there
i
just
ran
in
to
receive
the
guests
and
if
you
weren
t
a
fool
a
common

if
you
were

original
instead
of
a
translation
you
see
rodya
i
recognise
you
re
a
clever
fellow
but
you
re
a
fool
and
if
you
weren
t
a
fool
you

this
evening
instead
of

boots

the
street

it
i

razumihin
shouted
out
of
patience
how
do
you
know
you
can
t
answer
for
yourself
you
don
t
know
anything
about
it
thousands
of
times
i
ve
fought
tooth
and
nail
with
people
and
run
back
to
them
afterwards
one
feels
ashamed
and
goes
back
to
a
man
so
remember
potchinkov
s
house
on
the
third
storey
why
mr
razumihin
i
do
believe
you
d
let
anybody
beat
you
from
sheer
benevolence
beat
whom
me
i
d
twist
his
nose
off
at
the
mere
idea
potchinkov
s
house
47
babushkin
s
flat
i
shall
not
come
razumihin
raskolnikov
turned
and
walked
away
i
bet
you
will
razumihin
shouted
after
him
i
refuse
to
know
you
if
you
don
t
stay
hey
is
zametov
in
there
yes
did
you
see
him
yes
talked
to
him
yes
what
about
confound
you
don
t
tell
me
then
potchinkov
s
house
47
babushkin
s
flat
remember
raskolnikov
walked
on
and
turned
the
corner
into
sadovy
street
razumihin
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
went
into
the
house
but
stopped
short
of
the
stairs
confound
it
he
went
on
almost
aloud
he
talked
sensibly
but
yet
i
am
a
fool
as
if
madmen
didn
t
talk
sensibly
and
this
was
just
what
zossimov
seemed
afraid
of
he
struck
his
finger
on
his
forehead
what
if
how
could
i
let
him
go
off
alone
he
may
drown
himself
ach
what
a
blunder
i
can
t
and
he
ran
back
to
overtake
raskolnikov
but
there
was
no
trace
of
him
with
a
curse
he
returned
with
rapid
steps
to
the
palais
de
cristal
to
question
zametov
raskolnikov
walked
straight
to
x
bridge
stood
in
the
middle
and
leaning
both
elbows
on
the
rail
stared
into
the
distance
on
parting
with
razumihin
he
felt
so
much
weaker
that
he
could
scarcely
reach
this
place
he
longed
to
sit
or
lie
down
somewhere
in
the
street
bending
over
the
water
he
gazed
mechanically
at
the
last
pink
flush
of
the
sunset
at
the
row
of
houses
growing
dark
in
the
gathering
twilight
at
one
distant
attic
window
on
the
left
bank
flashing
as
though
on
fire
in
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
at
the
darkening
water
of
the
canal
and
the
water
seemed
to
catch
his
attention
at
last
red
circles
flashed
before
his
eyes
the
houses
seemed
moving
the
passers
by
the
canal
banks
the
carriages
all
danced
before
his
eyes
suddenly
he
started
saved
again
perhaps
from
swooning
by
an
uncanny
and
hideous
sight
he
became
aware
of
someone
standing
on
the
right
side
of
him
he
looked
and
saw
a
tall
woman
with
a
kerchief
on
her
head
with
a
long
yellow
wasted
face
and
red
sunken
eyes
she
was
looking
straight
at
him
but
obviously
she
saw
nothing
and
recognised
no
one
suddenly
she
leaned
her
right
hand
on
the
parapet
lifted
her
right
leg
over
the
railing
then
her
left
and
threw
herself
into
the
canal
the
filthy
water
parted
and
swallowed
up
its
victim
for
a
moment
but
an
instant
later
the
drowning
woman
floated
to
the
surface
moving
slowly
with
the
current
her
head
and
legs
in
the
water
her
skirt
inflated
like
a
balloon
over
her
back
a
woman
drowning
a
woman
drowning
shouted
dozens
of
voices
people
ran
up
both
banks
were
thronged
with
spectators
on
the
bridge
people
crowded
about
raskolnikov
pressing
up
behind
him
mercy
on
it
it
s
our
afrosinya
a
woman
cried
tearfully
close
by
mercy
save
her
kind
people
pull
her
out
a
boat
a
boat
was
shouted
in
the
crowd
but
there
was
no
need
of
a
boat
a
policeman
ran
down
the
steps
to
the
canal
threw
off
his
great
coat
and
his
boots
and
rushed
into
the
water
it
was
easy
to
reach
her
she
floated
within
a
couple
of
yards
from
the
steps
he
caught
hold
of
her
clothes
with
his
right
hand
and
with
his
left
seized
a
pole
which
a
comrade
held
out
to
him
the
drowning
woman
was
pulled
out
at
once
they
laid
her
on
the
granite
pavement
of
the
embankment
she
soon
recovered
consciousness
raised
her
head
sat
up
and
began
sneezing
and
coughing
stupidly
wiping
her
wet
dress
with
her
hands
she
said
nothing
she
s
drunk
herself
out
of
her
senses
the
same
woman
s
voice
wailed
at
her
side
out
of
her
senses
the
other
day
she
tried
to
hang
herself
we
cut
her
down
i
ran
out
to
the
shop
just
now
left
my
little
girl
to
look
after
her
and
here
she
s
in
trouble
again
a
neighbour
gentleman
a
neighbour
we
live
close
by
the
second
house
from
the
end
see
yonder
the
crowd
broke
up
the
police
still
remained
round
the
woman
someone
mentioned
the
police
station
raskolnikov
looked
on
with
a
strange
sensation
of
indifference
and
apathy
he
felt
disgusted
no
that
s
loathsome
water
it
s
not
good
enough
he
muttered
to
himself
nothing
will
come
of
it
he
added
no
use
to
wait
what
about
the
police
office
and
why
isn
t
zametov
at
the
police
office
the
police
office
is
open
till
ten
o
clock
he
turned
his
back
to
the
railing
and
looked
about
him
very
well
then
he
said
resolutely
he
moved
from
the
bridge
and
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
police
office
his
heart
felt
hollow
and
empty
he
did
not
want
to
think
even
his
depression
had
passed
there
was
not
a
trace
now
of
the
energy
with
which
he
had
set
out
to
make
an
end
of
it
all
complete
apathy
had
succeeded
to
it
well
it
s
a
way
out
of
it
he
thought
walking
slowly
and
listlessly
along
the
canal
bank
anyway
i
ll
make
an
end
for
i
want
to
but
is
it
a
way
out
what
does
it
matter
there
ll
be
the
square
yard
of
space
ha
but
what
an
end
is
it
really
the
end
shall
i
tell
them
or
not
ah
damn
how
tired
i
am
if
i
could
find
somewhere
to
sit
or
lie
down
soon
what
i
am
most
ashamed
of
is
its
being
so
stupid
but
i
don
t
care
about
that
either
what
idiotic
ideas
come
into
one
s
head
to
reach
the
police
office
he
had
to
go
straight
forward
and
take
the
second
turning
to
the
left
it
was
only
a
few
paces
away
but
at
the
first
turning
he
stopped
and
after
a
minute
s
thought
turned
into
a
side
street
and
went
two
streets
out
of
his
way
possibly
without
any
object
or
possibly
to
delay
a
minute
and
gain
time
he
walked
looking
at
the
ground
suddenly
someone
seemed
to
whisper
in
his
ear
he
lifted
his
head
and
saw
that
he
was
standing
at
the
very
gate
of
the
house
he
had
not
passed
it
he
had
not
been
near
it
since
that
evening
an
overwhelming
unaccountable
prompting
drew
him
on
he
went
into
the
house
passed
through
the
gateway
then
into
the
first
entrance
on
the
right
and
began
mounting
the
familiar
staircase
to
the
fourth
storey
the
narrow
steep
staircase
was
very
dark
he
stopped
at
each
landing
and
looked
round
him
with
curiosity
on
the
first
landing
the
framework
of
the
window
had
been
taken
out
that
wasn
t
so
then
he
thought
here
was
the
flat
on
the
second
storey
where
nikolay
and
dmitri
had
been
working
it
s
shut
up
and
the
door
newly
painted
so
it
s
to
let
then
the
third
storey
and
the
fourth
here
he
was
perplexed
to
find
the
door
of
the
flat
wide
open
there
were
men
there
he
could
hear
voices
he
had
not
expected
that
after
brief
hesitation
he
mounted
the
last
stairs
and
went
into
the
flat
it
too
was
being
done
up
there
were
workmen
in
it
this
seemed
to
amaze
him
he
somehow
fancied
that
he
would
find
everything
as
he
left
it
even
perhaps
the
corpses
in
the
same
places
on
the
floor
and
now
bare
walls
no
furniture
it
seemed
strange
he
walked
to
the
window
and
sat
down
on
the
window
sill
there
were
two
workmen
both
young
fellows
but
one
much
younger
than
the
other
they
were
papering
the
walls
with
a
new
white
paper
covered
with
lilac
flowers
instead
of
the
old
dirty
yellow
one
raskolnikov
for
some
reason
felt
horribly
annoyed
by
this
he
looked
at
the
new
paper
with
dislike
as
though
he
felt
sorry
to
have
it
all
so
changed
the
workmen
had
obviously
stayed
beyond
their
time
and
now
they
were
hurriedly
rolling
up
their
paper
and
getting
ready
to
go
home
they
took
no
notice
of
raskolnikov
s
coming
in
they
were
talking
raskolnikov
folded
his
arms
and
listened
she
comes
to
me
in
the
morning
said
the
elder
to
the
younger
very
early
all
dressed
up
why
are
you
preening
and
prinking
says
i
i
am
ready
to
do
anything
to
please
you
tit
vassilitch
that
s
a
way
of
going
on
and
she
dressed
up
like
a
regular
fashion
book
and
what
is
a
fashion
book
the
younger
one
asked
he
obviously
regarded
the
other
as
an
authority
a
fashion
book
is
a
lot
of
pictures
coloured
and
they
come
to
the
tailors
here
every
saturday
by
post
from
abroad
to
show
folks
how
to
dress
the
male
sex
as
well
as
the
female
they
re
pictures
the
gentlemen
are
generally
wearing
fur
coats
and
for
the
ladies
fluffles
they
re
beyond
anything
you
can
fancy
there
s
nothing
you
can
t
find
in
petersburg
the
younger
cried
enthusiastically
except
father
and
mother
there
s
everything
except
them
there
s
everything
to
be
found
my
boy
the
elder
declared
sententiously
raskolnikov
got
up
and
walked
into
the
other
room
where
the
strong
box
the
bed
and
the
chest
of
drawers
had
been
the
room
seemed
to
him
very
tiny
without
furniture
in
it
the
paper
was
the
same
the
paper
in
the
corner
showed
where
the
case
of
ikons
had
stood
he
looked
at
it
and
went
to
the
window
the
elder
workman
looked
at
him
askance
what
do
you
want
he
asked
suddenly
instead
of
answering
raskolnikov
went
into
the
passage
and
pulled
the
bell
the
same
bell
the
same
cracked
note
he
rang
it
a
second
and
a
third
time
he
listened
and
remembered
the
hideous
and
agonisingly
fearful
sensation
he
had
felt
then
began
to
come
back
more
and
more
vividly
he
shuddered
at
every
ring
and
it
gave
him
more
and
more
satisfaction
well
what
do
you
want
who
are
you
the
workman
shouted
going
out
to
him
raskolnikov
went
inside
again
i
want
to
take
a
flat
he
said
i
am
looking
round
it
s
not

and
you
ought
to
come

raskolnikov
went
on

old
woman
and
her
sister

uneasy

in
amazement

go

late

along
alyoshka

must
lock
up
said
the
elder
workman
very
well
come
along
said
raskolnikov
indifferently
and
going
out
first
he
went
slowly
downstairs
hey
porter
he
cried
in
the
gateway
at
the
entrance
several
people
were
standing
staring
at
the
passers
by
the
two
porters
a
peasant
woman
a
man
in
a
long
coat
and
a
few
others
raskolnikov
went
straight
up
to
them
what

of

porters

the
assistant
there
he
was
there
for
a
time
what
do

want
raskolnikov
made
no
reply
but
stood
beside
them
lost
in
thought
he
s
been
to
look
at
the
flat
said
the
elder
workman
coming
forward
which
flat
where
we
are
at
work
why
have
you
washed
away
the
blood
says
he
there
has
been
a
murder

he
and
i
ve
come
to

and
he
began
ringing
at
the
bell
all
but
broke
it
come
to
the
police
station
says
he
i
ll
tell
you
everything
there
he
wouldn
t
leave

the
porter
looked
at
raskolnikov
frowning
and
perplexed
who
are

he
shouted
as
impressively
as
he
could
i

a
student

shil
s
house
not
far

ask
the
porter
he
knows
me
raskolnikov
said
all
this
in
a
lazy
dreamy
voice
not
turning
round
but
looking
intently
into
the
darkening
street
why
have
you
been
to
the
flat
to
look
at
it
what
is
there
to
look
at
take
him
straight
to
the
police
station
the
man
in
the
long
coat
jerked
in
abruptly
raskolnikov
looked
intently
at
him
over
his
shoulder
and
said
in
the
same
slow
lazy
tones
come
along
yes
take
him
the
man
went
on
more
confidently
why
was
he
going
into
that
what
s
in
his
mind
eh
he
s
not
drunk
but
god
knows
what
s
the
matter
with
him
muttered
the
workman
but
what
do
you
want
the
porter
shouted
again
beginning
to
get
angry
in
earnest
why
are
you
hanging
about
you
funk
the
police
station
then
said
raskolnikov
jeeringly
how
funk
it
why
are
you
hanging
about
he
s
a
rogue
shouted
the
peasant
woman
why
waste
time
talking
to
him
cried
the
other
porter
a
huge
peasant
in
a
full
open
coat
and
with
keys
on
his
belt
get
along
he
is
a
rogue
and
no
mistake
get
along
and
seizing
raskolnikov
by
the
shoulder
he
flung
him
into
the
street
he
lurched
forward
but
recovered
his
footing
looked
at
the
spectators
in
silence
and
walked
away
strange
man
observed
the
workman
there
are
strange
folks
about
nowadays
said
the
woman
you
should
have
taken
him
to
the
police
station
all
the
same
said
the
man
in
the
long
coat
better
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
decided
the
big
porter
a
regular
rogue
just
what
he
wants
you
may
be
sure
but
once
take
him
up
you
won
t
get
rid
of
him
we
know
the
sort
shall
i
go
there
or
not
thought
raskolnikov
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
thoroughfare
at
the
cross
roads
and
he
looked
about
him
as
though
expecting
from
someone
a
decisive
word
but
no
sound
came
all
was
dead
and
silent
like
the
stones
on
which
he
walked
dead
to
him
to
him
alone
all
at
once
at
the
end
of
the
street
two
hundred
yards
away
in
the
gathering
dusk
he
saw
a
crowd
and
heard
talk
and
shouts
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
stood
a
carriage
a
light
gleamed
in
the
middle
of
the
street
what
is
it
raskolnikov
turned
to
the
right
and
went
up
to
the
crowd
he
seemed
to
clutch
at
everything
and
smiled
coldly
when
he
recognised
it
for
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the
police
station
and
knew
that
it
would
all
soon
be
over
chapter
vii
an
elegant
carriage
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
a
pair
of
spirited
grey
horses
there
was
no
one
in
it
and
the
coachman
had
got
off
his
box
and
stood
by
the
horses
were
being
held
by
the
bridle
a
mass
of
people
had
gathered
round
the
police
standing
in
front
one
of
them
held
a
lighted
lantern
which
he
was
turning
on
something
lying
close
to
the
wheels
everyone
was
talking
shouting
exclaiming
the
coachman
seemed
at
a
loss
and
kept
repeating
what
a
misfortune
good
lord
what
a
misfortune
raskolnikov
pushed
his
way
in
as
far
as
he
could
and
succeeded
at
last
in
seeing
the
object
of
the
commotion
and
interest
on
the
ground
a
man
who
had
been
run
over
lay
apparently
unconscious
and
covered
with
blood
he
was
very
badly
dressed
but
not
like
a
workman
blood
was
flowing
from
his
head
and
face
his
face
was
crushed
mutilated
and
disfigured
he
was
evidently
badly
injured
merciful
heaven
wailed
the
coachman
what
more
could
i
do
if
i
d
been
driving
fast
or
had
not
shouted
to
him
but
i
was
going
quietly
not
in
a
hurry
everyone
could
see
i
was
going
along
just
like
everybody
else
a
drunken
man
can
t
walk
straight
we
all
know
i
saw
him
crossing
the
street
staggering
and
almost
falling
i
shouted
again
and
a
second
and
a
third
time
then
i
held
the
horses
in
but
he
fell
straight
under
their
feet
either
he
did
it
on
purpose
or
he
was
very
tipsy
the
horses
are
young
and
ready
to
take
fright
they
started
he
screamed
that
made
them
worse
that
s
how
it
happened
that
s
just
how
it
was
a
voice
in
the
crowd
confirmed
he
shouted
that
s
true
he
shouted
three
times
another
voice
declared
three
times
it
was
we
all
heard
it
shouted
a
third
but
the
coachman
was
not
very
much
distressed
and
frightened
it
was
evident
that
the
carriage
belonged
to
a
rich
and
important
person
who
was
awaiting
it
somewhere
the
police
of
course
were
in
no
little
anxiety
to
avoid
upsetting
his
arrangements
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
take
the
injured
man
to
the
police
station
and
the
hospital
no
one
knew
his
name
meanwhile
raskolnikov
had
squeezed
in
and
stooped
closer
over
him
the
lantern
suddenly
lighted
up
the
unfortunate
man
s
face
he
recognised
him
i
know
him
i
know
him
he
shouted
pushing
to
the
front
it
s
a
government
clerk
retired
from
the
service
marmeladov
he
lives
close
by
in
kozel
s
house
make

for
a
doctor

will
pay
see
he
pulled
money
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
the
policeman
he
was
in
violent
agitation
the
police
were
glad
that
they
had
found
out
who
the
man
was
raskolnikov
gave
his
own
name
and
address
and
as
earnestly
as
if
it
had
been
his
father
he
besought
the
police
to
carry
the
unconscious
marmeladov
to
his
lodging
at
once
just
here
three
houses
away
he
said
eagerly
the
house
belongs
to
kozel
a
rich
german
he
was
going
home
no
doubt
drunk
i
know
him
he
is
a
drunkard
he
has
a
family
there
a
wife
children
he
has
one
daughter
it
will

time
to
take
him
to
the
hospital
and
there

a
doctor
in
the
house
i

looked
after
at
home
they

once
but
he

die
before
you
get
him
to
the
hospital
he
managed
to
slip
something
unseen
into
the
policeman
s
hand
but
the
thing
was
straightforward
and
legitimate
and
in
any
case
help
was
closer
here
they
raised
the
injured
man
people
volunteered
to
help
kozel
s
house
was
thirty
yards
away
raskolnikov
walked
behind
carefully
holding
marmeladov
s
head
and
showing
the
way
this
way
this
way
we
must
take
him
upstairs
head
foremost
turn
round
i
ll
pay
i
ll
make
it
worth
your
while
he
muttered
katerina
ivanovna
had
just
begun
as
she
always
did
at
every
free
moment
walking
to
and
fro
in
her
little
room
from
window
to
stove
and
back
again
with
her
arms
folded
across
her
chest
talking
to
herself
and
coughing
of
late
she
had
begun
to
talk
more
than
ever
to
her
eldest
girl
polenka
a
child
of
ten
who
though
there
was
much
she
did
not
understand
understood
very
well
that
her
mother
needed
her
and
so
always
watched
her
with
her
big
clever
eyes
and
strove
her
utmost
to
appear
to
understand
this
time
polenka
was
undressing
her
little
brother
who
had
been
unwell
all
day
and
was
going
to
bed
the
boy
was
waiting
for
her
to
take
off
his
shirt
which
had
to
be
washed
at
night
he
was
sitting
straight
and
motionless
on
a
chair
with
a
silent
serious
face
with
his
legs
stretched
out
straight
before
him
heels
together
and
toes
turned
out
he
was
listening
to
what
his
mother
was
saying
to
his
sister
sitting
perfectly
still
with
pouting
lips
and
wide
open
eyes
just
as
all
good
little
boys
have
to
sit
when
they
are
undressed
to
go
to
bed
a
little
girl
still
younger
dressed
literally
in
rags
stood
at
the
screen
waiting
for
her
turn
the
door
on
to
the
stairs
was
open
to
relieve
them
a
little
from
the
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
which
floated
in
from
the
other
rooms
and
brought
on
long
terrible
fits
of
coughing
in
the
poor
consumptive
woman
katerina
ivanovna
seemed
to
have
grown
even
thinner
during
that
week
and
the
hectic
flush
on
her
face
was
brighter
than
ever
you
wouldn
t
believe
you
can
t
imagine
polenka
she
said
walking
about
the
room
what
a
happy
luxurious
life
we
had
in
my
papa
s
house
and
how
this
drunkard
has
brought
me
and
will
bring
you
all
to
ruin
papa
was
a
civil
colonel
and
only
a
step
from
being
a
governor
so
that
everyone
who
came
to
see
him
said
we
look
upon
you
ivan
mihailovitch
as
our
governor
when
i
when
she
coughed
violently
oh
cursed
life
she
cried
clearing
her
throat
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
breast
when
i
when
at
the
last
ball
at
the
marshal
s
princess
bezzemelny
saw
me

gave
me
the
blessing
when

she
cried
noticing
a
crowd
in
the
passage
and
the
men
who
were
pushing
into
her
room
carrying
a
burden
what
is
it
what
are
they
bringing
mercy
on
us
where

we
to
put

asked
the
policeman
looking
round
when
marmeladov
unconscious
and
covered
with
blood
had
been
carried
in
on
the
sofa
put
him
straight
on
the
sofa
with
his
head
this
way
raskolnikov
showed
him
run
over
in
the
road
drunk
someone
shouted
in
the
passage
katerina
ivanovna
stood
turning
white
and
gasping
for
breath
the
children
were
terrified
little
lida
screamed
rushed
to
polenka
and
clutched
at
her
trembling
all
over
having
laid
marmeladov
down
raskolnikov
flew
to
katerina
ivanovna
for
god
s
sake
be
calm

t
be

he
said
speaking
quickly
he
was
crossing
the
road
and
was
run
over
by
a
carriage

t
be
frightened
he
will

he

done
it
this
time
katerina
ivanovna
cried
despairingly
and
she
rushed
to
her
husband
raskolnikov
noticed
at
once
that
she
was
not
one
of
those
women
who
swoon
easily
she
instantly
placed
under
the
luckless
man
s
head
a
pillow
which
no
one
had
thought
of
and
began
undressing
and
examining
him
she
kept
her
head
forgetting
herself
biting
her
trembling
lips
and
stifling
the
screams
which
were
ready
to
break
from
her
raskolnikov
meanwhile
induced
someone
to
run
for
a
doctor
there
was
a
doctor
it
appeared
next
door
but
one
i
ve
sent
for
a
doctor
he
kept
assuring
katerina
ivanovna
don
t
be
uneasy
i
ll
pay
haven
t
you
water
and
give
me
a
napkin
or
a
towel
anything
as
quick
as
you
can
he
is
injured
but
not
killed
believe
me
we
shall
see
what
the
doctor
says
katerina
ivanovna
ran
to
the
window
there
on
a
broken
chair
in
the
corner
a
large
earthenware
basin
full
of
water
had
been
stood
in
readiness
for
washing
her
children
s
and
husband
s
linen
that
night
this
washing
was
done
by
katerina
ivanovna
at
night
at
least
twice
a
week
if
not
oftener
for
the
family
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
they
were
practically
without
change
of
linen
and
katerina
ivanovna
could
not
endure
uncleanliness
and
rather
than
see
dirt
in
the
house
she
preferred
to
wear
herself
out
at
night
working
beyond
her
strength
when
the
rest
were
asleep
so
as
to
get
the
wet
linen
hung
on
a
line
and
dry
by
the
morning
she
took
up
the
basin
of
water
at
raskolnikov
s
request
but
almost
fell
down
with
her
burden
but
the
latter
had
already
succeeded
in
finding
a
towel
wetted
it
and
began
washing
the
blood
off
marmeladov
s
face
katerina
ivanovna
stood
by
breathing
painfully
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
breast
she
was
in
need
of
attention
herself
raskolnikov
began
to
realise
that
he
might
have
made
a
mistake
in
having
the
injured
man
brought
here
the
policeman
too
stood
in
hesitation
polenka
cried
katerina
ivanovna
run
to
sonia
make
haste
if
you
don
t
find
her
at
home
leave
word
that
her
father
has
been
run
over
and
that
she
is
to
come
here
at
once
when
she
comes
in
run
polenka
there
put
on
the
shawl
run
your
fastest
cried
the
little
boy
on
the
chair
suddenly
after
which
he
relapsed
into
the
same
dumb
rigidity
with
round
eyes
his
heels
thrust
forward
and
his
toes
spread
out
meanwhile
the
room
had
become
so
full
of
people
that
you
couldn
t
have
dropped
a
pin
the
policemen
left
all
except
one
who
remained
for
a
time
trying
to
drive
out
the
people
who
came
in
from
the
stairs
almost
all
madame
lippevechsel
s
lodgers
had
streamed
in
from
the
inner
rooms
of
the
flat
at
first
they
were
squeezed
together
in
the
doorway
but
afterwards
they
overflowed
into
the
room
katerina
ivanovna
flew
into
a
fury
you
might
let
him
die
in
peace
at
least
she
shouted
at
the
crowd
is
it
a
spectacle
for
you
to
gape
at
with
cigarettes
cough
cough
cough
you
might
as
well
keep
your
hats
on
and
there
is
one
in
his
hat
get
away
you
should
respect
the
dead
at
least
her
cough
choked
her
but
her
reproaches
were
not
without
result
they
evidently
stood
in
some
awe
of
katerina
ivanovna
the
lodgers
one
after
another
squeezed
back
into
the
doorway
with
that
strange
inner
feeling
of
satisfaction
which
may
be
observed
in
the
presence
of
a
sudden
accident
even
in
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
victim
from
which
no
living
man
is
exempt
even
in
spite
of
the
sincerest
sympathy
and
compassion
voices
outside
were
heard
however
speaking
of
the
hospital
and
saying
that
they
d
no
business
to
make
a
disturbance
here
no
business
to
die
cried
katerina
ivanovna
and
she
was
rushing
to
the
door
to
vent
her
wrath
upon
them
but
in
the
doorway
came
face
to
face
with
madame
lippevechsel
who
had
only
just
heard
of
the
accident
and
ran
in
to
restore
order
she
was
a
particularly
quarrelsome
and
irresponsible
german
ah
my
god
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
your
husband
drunken
horses
have
trampled
to
the
hospital
with
him
i
am
the
landlady
amalia
ludwigovna
i
beg
you
to
recollect
what
you
are
saying
katerina
ivanovna
began
haughtily
she
always
took
a
haughty
tone
with
the
landlady
that
she
might
remember
her
place
and
even
now
could
not
deny
herself
this
satisfaction
amalia
ludwigovna
i
have
you
once
before
told
that
you
to
call
me
amalia
ludwigovna
may
not
dare
i
am
amalia
ivanovna
you
are
not
amalia
ivanovna
but
amalia
ludwigovna
and
as
i
am
not
one
of
your
despicable
flatterers
like
mr
lebeziatnikov
who
s
laughing
behind
the
door
at
this
moment
a
laugh
and
a
cry
of
they
are
at
it
again
was
in
fact
audible
at
the
door
so
i
shall
always
call
you
amalia
ludwigovna
though
i
fail
to
understand
why
you
dislike
that
name
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
has
happened
to
semyon
zaharovitch
he
is
dying
i
beg
you
to
close
that
door
at
once
and
to
admit
no
one
let
him
at
least
die
in
peace
or
i
warn
you
the
governor
general
himself
shall
be
informed
of
your
conduct
to
morrow
the
prince
knew
me
as
a
girl
he
remembers
semyon
zaharovitch
well
and
has
often
been
a
benefactor
to
him
everyone
knows
that
semyon
zaharovitch
had
many
friends
and
protectors
whom
he
abandoned
himself
from
an
honourable
pride
knowing
his
unhappy
weakness
but
now
she
pointed
to
raskolnikov
a
generous
young
man
has
come
to
our
assistance
who
has
wealth
and
connections
and
whom
semyon
zaharovitch
has
known
from
a
child
you
may
rest
assured
amalia
ludwigovna
all
this
was
uttered
with
extreme
rapidity
getting
quicker
and
quicker
but
a
cough
suddenly
cut
short
katerina
ivanovna
s
eloquence
at
that
instant
the
dying
man
recovered
consciousness
and
uttered
a
groan
she
ran
to
him
the
injured
man
opened
his
eyes
and
without
recognition
or
understanding
gazed
at
raskolnikov
who
was
bending
over
him
he
drew
deep
slow
painful
breaths
blood
oozed
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
drops
of
perspiration
came
out
on
his
forehead
not
recognising
raskolnikov
he
began
looking
round
uneasily
katerina
ivanovna
looked
at
him
with
a
sad
but
stern
face
and
tears
trickled
from
her
eyes
my
god
his
whole
chest
is
crushed
how
he
is
bleeding
she
said
in
despair
we
must
take
off
his
clothes
turn
a
little
semyon
zaharovitch
if
you
can
she
cried
to
him
marmeladov
recognised
her
a
priest
he
articulated
huskily
katerina
ivanovna
walked
to
the
window
laid
her
head
against
the
window
frame
and
exclaimed
in
despair
oh
cursed
life
a
priest
the
dying
man
said
again
after
a
moment
s
silence
they
ve
gone
for
him
katerina
ivanovna
shouted
to
him
he
obeyed
her
shout
and
was
silent
with
sad
and
timid
eyes
he
looked
for
her
she
returned
and
stood
by
his
pillow
he
seemed
a
little
easier
but
not
for
long
soon
his
eyes
rested
on
little
lida
his
favourite
who
was
shaking
in
the
corner
as
though
she
were
in
a
fit
and
staring
at
him
with
her
wondering
childish
eyes
a
ah
he
signed
towards
her
uneasily
he
wanted
to
say
something
